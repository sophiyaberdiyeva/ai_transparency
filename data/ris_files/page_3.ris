TI  - Ambiguous Persuasion: An Ex-Ante Formulation
AU  - Cheng, X.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Consider a persuasion game where both the sender and receiver are ambiguity averse with maxmin expected utility (MEU) preferences and the sender can choose an ambiguous information structure. This paper analyzes the game in an ex-ante formulation: the sender first commits to an information structure, and then the receiver best responds by choosing an ex-ante message-contingent action plan. Under this formulation, I show it is never strictly beneficial for the sender to use an ambiguous information structure as opposed to a standard unambiguous one. This result is robust to (i) both players having (possibly heterogeneous) ambiguous beliefs over the states, and/or (ii) the receiver having non-MEU, uncertainty-averse preferences. However, it is not robust to the sender having non-MEU preferences.

AB  - The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning and deep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in several ways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for a deeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The concept of explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal system mechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems that support human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable in order to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. In this work, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energy efficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasive recommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. The persuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) or on a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason for recommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using a Telegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data and human feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19% on the recommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasive facts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems, demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energy saving behavior.

AB  - Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will transform transportation, but also the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. In the absence of a driver, it is not clear how an AV can communicate its intention to pedestrians. One option is to use visual signals. To advance their design, we conduct four human-participant experiments and evaluate six representative AV visual signals for visibility, intuitiveness, persuasiveness, and usability at pedestrian crossings. Based on the results, we distill twelve practical design recommendations for AV visual signals, with focus on signal pattern design and placement. Moreover, the paper advances the methodology for experimental evaluation of visual signals, including lab, closed-course, and public road tests using an autonomous vehicle. In addition, the paper also reports insights on pedestrian crosswalk behaviours and the impacts of pedestrian trust towards AVs on the behaviors. We hope that this work will constitute valuable input to the ongoing development of international standards for AV lamps, and thus help mature automated driving in general.

AB  - Interpreting how persuasive language influences audiences has implications across many domains like advertising, argumentation, and propaganda. Persuasion relies on more than a message’s content. Arranging the order of the message itself (i.e., ordering specific rhetorical strategies) also plays an important role. To examine how strategy orderings contribute to persuasiveness, we first utilize a Variational Autoencoder model to disentangle content and rhetorical strategies in textual requests from a large-scale loan request corpus. We then visualize interplay between content and strategy through an attentional LSTM that predicts the success of textual requests. We find that specific (orderings of) strategies interact uniquely with a request’s content to impact success rate, and thus the persuasiveness of a request.

AB  - Privacy in Social Network Sites (SNSs) like Facebook or Instagram is closely related to people’s self-disclosure decisions and their ability to foresee the consequences of sharing personal information with large and diverse audiences. Nonetheless, online privacy decisions are often based on spurious risk judgements that make people liable to reveal sensitive data to untrusted recipients and become victims of social engineering attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combination with persuasive mechanisms like nudging is a promising approach for promoting preventative privacy behaviour among the users of SNSs. Nevertheless, combining behavioural interventions with high levels of personalization can be a potential threat to people’s agency and autonomy even when applied to the design of social engineering countermeasures. This paper elaborates on the ethical challenges that nudging mechanisms can introduce to the development of AI-based countermeasures, particularly to those addressing unsafe self-disclosure practices in SNSs. Overall, it endorses the elaboration of personalized risk awareness solutions as i) an ethical approach to counteract social engineering, and ii) as an effective means for promoting reflective privacy decisions.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Rules are pervasive in the law. In the context of computer engineering, the translation of legal text to algorithmic form is seemingly direct. In large part, law may be a ripe field for expert systems and machine learning. For engineers, existing law appears formulaic and logically reducible to ‘if, then’ statements. The underlying assumption is that the legal language is both self-referential and universal. Moreover, description is considered distinct from interpretation; that in describing the law, the language is seen as quantitative and objectifiable. Nevertheless, is descriptive formal language purely dissociative? From the logic machine of the 1970s to the modern fervor for artificial intelligence (AI), governance by numbers is making a persuasive return. Could translation be possible? The project follows a fundamentally semantic conundrum: what is the significance of ‘meaning’ in legal language? The project, therefore, tests translation by deconstructing sentences from existing legal judgments to their constituent factors. Definitions are then extracted in accordance with the interpretations of the judges. The intent is to build an expert system predicated on alleged rules of legal reasoning. The authors apply both linguistic modelling and natural language processing technology to parse the legal judgments. The project extends beyond prior research in the area, combining a broadly statistical model of context with the relative precision of syntactic structure. The preliminary hypothesis is that, by analyzing the components of legal language with a variety of techniques, we can begin to translate law to numerical form.

However, current techniques for explanation generation tend to strongly uphold the recommended products instead of presenting both reasons for and reasons against them. We argue that an RS can better enhance overall trust and transparency by frankly displaying both kinds of reasons to users. We have developed such an RS by exploiting knowledge graphs and by applying Snedegar’s theory of practical reasoning.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Introduction - Thanks to improvement of care, cancer has become a chronic condition. But due to the toxicity of treatment, the importance of supporting the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients increases. Monitoring and managing QoL relies on data collected by the patient in his/her home environment, its integration, and its analysis, which supports personalization of cancer management recommendations. We review the state-of-the-art of computerized systems that employ AI and Data Science methods to monitor the health status and provide support to cancer patients managed at home. Objective - Our main objective is to analyze the literature to identify open research challenges that a novel decision support system for cancer patients and clinicians will need to address, point to potential solutions, and provide a list of established best-practices to adopt. Methods - We designed a review study, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing studies retrieved from PubMed related to monitoring cancer patients in their home environments via sensors and self-reporting: what data is collected, what are the techniques used to collect data, semantically integrate it, infer the patient's state from it and deliver coaching/behavior change interventions. Results - Starting from an initial corpus of 819 unique articles, a total of 180 papers were considered in the full-text analysis and 109 were finally included in the review. Our findings are organized and presented in four main sub-topics consisting of data collection, data integration, predictive modeling and patient coaching. Conclusion - Development of modern decision support systems for cancer needs to utilize best practices like the use of validated electronic questionnaires for quality-of-life assessment, adoption of appropriate information modeling standards supplemented by terminologies/ontologies, adherence to FAIR data principles, external validation, stratification of patients in subgroups for better predictive modeling, and adoption of formal behavior change theories. Open research challenges include supporting emotional and social dimensions of wellbeing, including PROs in predictive modeling, and providing better customization of behavioral interventions for the specific population of cancer patients.

PY  - 2020
AB  - This work adds on to the on-going efforts to provide more autonomy to space robots. Here the concept of programming by demonstration or imitation learning is used for trajectory planning of manipulators mounted on small spacecraft. For greater autonomy in future space missions and minimal human intervention through ground control, a robot arm having 7-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) is envisaged for carrying out multiple tasks like debris removal, on-orbit servicing and assembly. Since actual hardware implementation of microgravity environment is extremely expensive, the demonstration data for trajectory learning is generated using a model predictive controller (MPC) in a physics based simulator. The data is then encoded compactly by Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). This offline trajectory learning allows faster reproductions and also avoids any computationally expensive optimizations after deployment in a space environment. It is shown that the probabilistic distribution can be used to generate trajectories to previously unseen situations by conditioning the distribution. The motion of the robot (or manipulator) arm induces reaction forces on the spacecraft and hence its attitude changes prompting the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) to take large corrective action that drains energy out of the system. By having a robot arm with redundant DoF helps in finding several possible trajectories from the same start to the same target. This allows the ProMP trajectory generator to sample out the trajectory which is obstacle free as well as having minimal attitudinal disturbances thereby reducing the load on ADCS.

AB  - Behavioral economics and existentialism both have persuasive, informative perspectives on human choice and welfare. We argue in this paper that the weaknesses in each of their positions are answered by the strengths in the other, creating a more comprehensive vision of what human choice is and how we should engage with the modern world. The dialogue between existentialism and behavioral economics can help us understand why we should protect our choices as our own and how doing so may be more difficult than we anticipate. While individuals are internally and situationally constrained, they can always endeavor to treat themselves as free. Acknowledging this tension in the form of a theoretical synthesis – which we propose to call Existentialist Welfare Economics – can help navigate the threat of identity-shaping social and technological developments, such as nudges or artificial intelligence.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Reputation is crucial to enabling human or software agents to select among alternative providers. Although several effective reputation assessment methods exist, they typically distil reputation into a numerical representation, with no accompanying explanation of the rationale behind the assessment. Such explanations would allow users or clients to make a richer assessment of providers, and tailor selection according to their preferences and current context. In this paper, we propose an approach to explain the rationale behind assessments from quantitative reputation models, by generating arguments that are combined to form explanations. Our approach adapts, extends and combines existing approaches for explaining decisions made using multi-attribute decision models in the context of reputation. We present example argument templates, and describe how to select their parameters using explanation algorithms. Our proposal was evaluated by means of a user study, which followed an existing protocol. Our results give evidence that although explanations present a subset of the information of trust scores, they are sufficient to equally evaluate providers recommended based on their trust score. Moreover, when explanation arguments reveal implicit model information, they are less persuasive than scores.

AB  - Intelligent services provide the power of AI to developers via simple RESTful API endpoints, abstracting away many complexities of machine learning. However, most of these intelligent services-such as computer vision-continually learn with time. When the internals within the abstracted 'black box' become hidden and evolve, pitfalls emerge in the robustness of applications that depend on these evolving services. Without adapting the way developers plan and construct projects reliant on intelligent services, significant gaps and risks result in both project planning and development. Therefore, how can software engineers best mitigate software evolution risk moving forward, thereby ensuring that their own applications maintain quality? Our proposal is an architectural tactic designed to improve intelligent service-dependent software robustness. The tactic involves creating an application-specific benchmark dataset baselined against an intelligent service, enabling evolutionary behaviour changes to be mitigated. A technical evaluation of our implementation of this architecture demonstrates how the tactic can identify 1,054 cases of substantial confidence evolution and 2,461 cases of substantial changes to response label sets using a dataset consisting of 331 images that evolve when sent to a service.

AB  - Argumentation is a type of discourse where speakers try to persuade their audience about the reasonableness of a claim by presenting supportive arguments. Most work in argument mining has focused on modeling arguments in monologues. We propose a computational model for argument mining in online persuasive discussion forums that brings together the micro-level (argument as product) and macrolevel (argument as process) models of argumentation. Fundamentally, this approach relies on identifying relations between components of arguments in a discussion thread. Our approach for relation prediction uses contextual information in terms of fine-Tuning a pretrained language model and leveraging discourse relations based on Rhetorical Structure Theory. We additionally propose a candidate selection method to automatically predict what parts of one's argument will be targeted by other participants in the discussion. Our models obtain significant improvements compared to recent state-of-The-Art approaches using pointer networks and a pre-Trained language model.

AB  - Delivery of digital behaviour change interventions which encourage physical activity has been tried in many forms. Most often interventions are delivered as text notifications, but these do not promote interaction. Advances in conversational AI have improved natural language understanding and generation, allowing AI chatbots to provide an engaging experience with the user. For this reason, chatbots have recently been seen in healthcare delivering digital interventions through free text or choice selection. In this work, we explore the use of voice based AI chatbots as a novel mode of intervention delivery, specifically targeting older adults to encourage physical activity. We co-created “FitChat”, an AI chatbot, with older adults and we evaluate the first prototype using Think Aloud Sessions. Our thematic evaluation suggests that older adults prefer voice based chat over text notifications or free text entry and that voice is a powerful mode for encouraging motivation.

This revolution is made more powerful because it is increasingly coupled with a rigorous and scientific approach to the law. In some ways law is looking more like a Silicon Valley startup and less like the oak-paneled law firms of the last 200 years. As law, technology, and science merge, the implications for the profession are wide sweeping. This article explores changes coming to persuasive legal writing, offering new thoughts on what the future will hold. Specifically, this article pilots a method for applying technology and science to measure, analyze, and improve persuasive legal writing, offering it as a proof of concept that anchors the article’s broader, and perhaps more controversial assertion. Namely, more powerful and refined persuasive legal writing software tools, fueled by artificial intelligence, should and will disrupt and reshape significant portions of the legal space, including how legal writing is taught and how it is produced. The effect will be to view legal writing as more science, and less art. The next set of luminaries won’t rely on anecdote or intuition to teach or create legal writing; they will rely on software and data.

Unlike prior works on this problem, we study the public persuasion problem in the general setting with: (i) arbitrary state spaces; (ii) arbitrary action spaces; (iii) arbitrary sender's utility functions. We fully characterize the computational complexity of computing a bi-criteria approximation of an optimal public signaling scheme. In particular, we show, in a voting setting of independent interest, that solving this problem requires at least a quasi-polynomial number of steps even in settings with a binary action space, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In doing so, we prove that a relaxed version of the MAXIMUM FEASIBLE SUBSYSTEM OF LINEAR INEQUALITIES problem requires at least quasi-polynomial time to be solved. Finally, we close the gap by providing a quasi-polynomial time bi-criteria approximation algorithm for arbitrary public persuasion problems that, in specific settings, yields a QPTAS.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Network congestion games are a well-understood model of multi-agent strategic interactions. Despite their ubiquitous applications, it is not clear whether it is possible to design information structures to ameliorate the overall experience of the network users. We focus on Bayesian games with atomic players, where network vagaries are modeled via a (random) state of nature which determines the costs incurred by the players. A third-party entity-the sender-can observe the realized state of the network and exploit this additional information to send a signal to each player. A natural question is the following: is it possible for an informed sender to reduce the overall social cost via the strategic provision of information to players who update their beliefs rationally? The paper focuses on the problem of computing optimal ex ante persuasive signaling schemes, showing that symmetry is a crucial property for its solution. Indeed, we show that an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time when players are symmetric and have affine cost functions. Moreover, the problem becomes NP-hard when players are asymmetric, even in non-Bayesian settings.

PY  - 2020
AB  - Lane-change maneuvers are commonly executed by drivers to follow a certain routing plan, overtake a slower vehicle, adapt to a merging lane ahead, etc. However, improper lane change behaviors can be a major cause of traffic flow disruptions and even crashes. While many rule-based methods have been proposed to solve lane change problems for autonomous driving, they tend to exhibit limited performance due to the uncertainty and complexity of the driving environment. Machine learning-based methods offer an alternative approach, as Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising success in many application domains including robotic manipulation, navigation, and playing video games. However, applying DRL for autonomous driving still faces many practical challenges in terms of slow learning rates, sample inefficiency, and non-stationary trajectories. In this study, we propose an automated lane change strategy using proximal policy optimization-based deep reinforcement learning, which shows great advantage in learning efficiency while maintaining stable performance. The trained agent is able to learn a smooth, safe, and efficient driving policy to determine lane-change decisions (i.e. when and how) even in dense traffic scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed policy is validated using task success rate and collision rate, which demonstrates the lane change maneuvers can be efficiently learned and executed in a safe, smooth and efficient manner.

AB  - A negotiation process by 2 agents ℓ1and ℓ2can be interleaved by another negotiation process between, say, ℓ1and ℓ3. The interleaving may alter the resource allocation assumed at the inception of the first negotiation process. Existing proposals for argumentation-based negotiations have focused primarily on two-agent bilateral negotiations, but scarcely on the concurrency of multi-agent negotiations. To fill the gap, we present a novel argumentation theory, basing its development on abstract persuasion argumentation (which is an abstract argumentation formalism with a dynamic relation). Incorporating into it numerical information and a mechanism of handshakes among members of the dynamic relation, we show that the extended theory adapts well to concurrent multi-agent negotiations over scarce resources.

PY  - 2020
AB  - —Explainable recommendation is far from being well solved partly due to three challenges. The first is the personalization of preference learning, which requires that different items/users have different contributions to the learning of user preference or item quality. The second one is dynamic explanation, which is crucial for the timeliness of recommendation explanations. The last one is the granularity of explanations. In practice, aspect-level explanations are more persuasive than item-level or user-level ones. In this paper, to address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel model called Hybrid Deep Embedding (HDE) for aspect-based explainable recommendations, which can make recommendations with dynamic aspect-level explanations. The main idea of HDE is to learn the dynamic embeddings of users and items for rating prediction and the dynamic latent aspect preference/quality vectors for the generation of aspect-level explanations, through fusion of the dynamic implicit feedbacks extracted from reviews and the attentive user-item interactions. Particularly, as the aspect preference/quality of users/items is learned automatically, HDE is able to capture the impact of aspects that are not mentioned in reviews of a user or an item. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the recommending performance and explainability of HDE. The source code of our work is available at https://github.com/lola63/HDE-Python.

However, little is known about how identities and inquiry strategies influence the conversation’s effectiveness. We conducted an online study involving 790 participants to be persuaded by a chatbot for charity donation. We designed a two by four factorial experiment (two chatbot identities and four inquiry strategies) where participants were randomly assigned to different conditions. Findings showed that the perceived identity of the chatbot had significant effects on the persuasion outcome (i.e., donation) and interpersonal perceptions (i.e., competence, confidence, warmth, and sincerity). Further, we identified interaction effects among perceived identities and inquiry strategies. We discuss the findings for theoretical and practical implications for developing ethical and effective persuasive chatbots. Our published data, codes, and analyses serve as the first step towards building competent ethical persuasive chatbots.

AB  - With the increasing growth of social media, people have started relying heavily on the information shared therein to form opinions and make decisions. While such a reliance is motivation for a variety of parties to promote information, it also makes people vulnerable to exploitation by slander, misinformation, terroristic and predatorial advances. In this work, we aim to understand and detect such attempts at persuasion. Existing works on detecting persuasion in text make use of lexical features for detecting persuasive tactics, without taking advantage of the possible structures inherent in the tactics used. We formulate the task as a multi-class classification problem and propose an unsupervised, domain-independent machine learning framework for detecting the type of persuasion used in text, which exploits the inherent sentence structure present in the different persuasion tactics. Our work shows promising results as compared to existing work.

AB  - End-to-end task-oriented dialog models have achieved promising performance on collaborative tasks where users willingly coordinate with the system to complete a given task. While in non-collaborative settings, for example, negotiation and persuasion, users and systems do not share a common goal. As a result, compared to collaborate tasks, people use social content to build rapport and trust in these non-collaborative settings in order to advance their goals. To handle social content, we introduce a hierarchical intent annotation scheme, which can be generalized to different non-collaborative dialog tasks. Building upon TransferTransfo (Wolf et al. 2019), we propose an end-to-end neural network model to generate diverse coherent responses. Our model utilizes intent and semantic slots as the intermediate sentence representation to guide the generation process. In addition, we design a filter to select appropriate responses based on whether these intermediate representations fit the designed task and conversation constraints. Our non-collaborative dialog model guides users to complete the task while simultaneously keeps them engaged. We test our approach on our newly proposed ANTISCAM dataset and an existing PERSUASIONFORGOOD dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that our model outperforms multiple baselines in these two non-collaborative tasks.

AB  - For some problems, it is difficult for humans to judge the goodness of AI-proposed solutions. Irving, Christiano, and Amodei (2018) propose that in such cases, we may use a debate between two AI systems to assist the human judge to select a good answer. We introduce a mathematical framework for modelling this type of debate and propose that the quality of debate designs may be measured by the accuracy of the most persuasive answer. We describe a simple instance of the debate framework called feature debate and analyze the degree to which such debates track the truth. We argue that despite being very simple, feature debates capture many aspects of practical debates such as the incentives to confuse the judge or stall to prevent losing. We analyze two special types of debates, those where arguments constitute independent evidence about the topic, and those where the information bandwidth of the judge is limited.

AU  - Atkinson, D.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Explanations are central to everyday life, and are a topic of growing interest in the AI community. To investigate the process of providing natural language explanations, we leverage the dynamics of the/r/ChangeMyView subreddit to build a dataset with 36K naturally occurring explanations of why an argument is persuasive. We propose a novel word-level prediction task to investigate how explanations selectively reuse, or echo, information from what is being explained (henceforth, explanandum). We develop features to capture the properties of a word in the explanandum, and show that our proposed features not only have relatively strong predictive power on the echoing of a word in an explanation, but also enhance neural methods of generating explanations. In particular, while the non-contextual properties of a word itself are more valuable for stopwords, the interaction between the constituent parts of an explanandum is crucial in predicting the echoing of content words. We also find intriguing patterns of a word being echoed. For example, although nouns are generally less likely to be echoed, subjects and objects can, depending on their source, be more likely to be echoed in the explanations.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Simulation has long been an essential part of testing autonomous driving systems, but only recently has simulation been useful for building and training self-driving vehicles. Vehicle behavioural models are necessary to simulate the interactions between robot cars. This paper proposed a new method to formalize the lane-changing model in urban driving scenarios. We define human incentives from different perspectives, speed incentive, route change incentive, comfort incentive and courtesy incentive etc. We applied a decision-theoretical tool, called Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to take these incentive policies into account. The strategy of combination is according to different driving style which varies for each driving. Thus a lane-changing decision selection algorithm is proposed. Not only our method allow to vary the motivation of lane-changing from purely egoistic desire to a more courtesy concern, but also they can mimic drivers' state, inattentive or concentrate, which influences their driving Behaviour. We define some cost functions and calibrate the parameters with different scenarios traffic data. Distinguishing driving styles are used to aggregate decision-makers' assessments about various criteria weightings to obtain the action drivers desire most. Our result demonstrates the proposed method can produce varied lane-changing behaviour. Unlike other lane-changing models based on artificial intelligence methods, our model has a more flexible controllability.

AU  - Mohan, S.
PY  - 2019
AB  - Our research aims to develop intelligent collaborative agents that are human-aware - they can model, learn, and reason about their human partner's physiological, cognitive, and affective states. In this paper, we study how adaptive coaching interactions can be designed to help people develop sustainable healthy behaviors. We leverage the common model of cognition - CMC [31] - as a framework for unifying several behavior change theories that are known to be useful in human-human coaching. We motivate a set of interactive system desiderata based on the CMC-based view of behavior change. Then, we propose PARCoach - an interactive system that addresses the desiderata. PARCoach helps a trainee pick a relevant health goal, set an implementation intention, and track their behavior. During this process, the trainee identifies a specific goal-directed behavior as well as the situational context in which they will perform it. PARCcoach uses this information to send notifications to the trainee, reminding them of their chosen behavior and the context. We report the results from a 4-week deployment with 60 participants. Our results support the CMC-based view of behavior change and demonstrate that the desiderata for proposed interactive system design is useful in producing behavior change.

PY  - 2019
AB  - It is expected that many human drivers will still prefer to drive themselves even if the self-driving technologies are ready. Therefore, human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coexist in a mixed traffic for a long time. To enable AVs to safely and efficiently maneuver in this mixed traffic, it is critical that the AVs can understand how humans cope with risks and make driving-related decisions. On the other hand, the driving environment is highly dynamic and ever-changing, and it is thus difficult to enumerate all the scenarios and hard-code the controllers. To face up these challenges, in this work, we incorporate a human decision-making model in reinforcement learning to control AVs for safe and efficient operations. Specifically, we adapt regret theory to describe a human driver’s lane-changing behavior, and fit the personalized models to individual drivers for predicting their lane-changing decisions. The predicted decisions are incorporated in the safety constraints for reinforcement learning in training and in implementation. We then use an extended version of double deep Q-network (DDQN) to train our AV controller within the safety set. By doing so, the amount of collisions in training is reduced to zero, while the training accuracy is not impinged.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Existing dialog system models require extensive human annotations and are difficult to generalize to different tasks. The recent success of large pre-trained language models has suggested the effectiveness of incorporating language priors in down-stream NLP tasks. However, how much pre-trained language models can help dialog response generation is still under exploration. In this paper, we propose a simple, general, and effective framework: Alternating Recurrent Dialog Model (ARDM). ARDM models each speaker separately and takes advantage of large pre-trained language models. It requires no supervision from human annotations such as belief states or dialog acts to achieve effective conversations. ARDM outperforms or is on par with the state-of-the-art methods on two popular task-oriented dialog datasets: CamRest676 and MultiWOZ. Moreover, we can generalize ARDM to more challenging, non-collaborative tasks such as persuasion. In the PersuasionForGood task, ARDM is capable of generating human-like responses to persuade people to donate to a charity.1

PY  - 2019
AB  - Maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated on a range of challenging continuous tasks. However, existing methods either suffer from severe instability when training on large off-policy data or cannot scale to tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion. Besides, the optimality of desired Boltzmann policy set for non-optimal soft value function is not persuasive enough. In this paper, we first derive soft policy gradient based on entropy regularized expected reward objective for RL with continuous actions. Then, we present an off-policy actor-critic, model-free maximum entropy deep RL algorithm called deep soft policy gradient (DSPG) by combining soft policy gradient with soft Bellman equation. To ensure stable learning while eliminating the need of two separate critics for soft value functions, we leverage double sampling approach to making the soft Bellman equation tractable. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms in performance over off-policy prior methods.

PY  - 2019
AB  - Video contents have become a critical tool for promoting products in E-commerce. However, the lack of automatic promotional video generation solutions makes large-scale video-based promotion campaigns infeasible. The first step of automatically producing promotional videos is to generate visual storylines, which is to select the building block footage and place them in an appropriate order. This task is related to the subjective viewing experience. It is hitherto performed by human experts and thus, hard to scale. To address this problem, we propose WundtBackpack, an algorithmic approach to generate storylines based on available visual materials, which can be video clips or images. It consists of two main parts, 1) the Learnable Wundt Curve to evaluate the perceived persuasiveness based on the stimulus intensity of a sequence of visual materials, which only requires a small volume of data to train; and 2) a clustering-based backpacking algorithm to generate persuasive sequences of visual materials while considering video length constraints. In this way, the proposed approach provides a dynamic structure to empower artificial intelligence (AI) to organize video footage in order to construct a sequence of visual stimuli with persuasive power. Extensive real-world experiments show that our approach achieves close to 10% higher perceived persuasiveness scores by human testers, and 12.5% higher expected revenue compared to the best performing state-of-the-art approach.

PY  - 2019
AB  - We study an information-structure design problem (a.k.a. persuasion) with a single sender and multiple receivers with actions of a priori unknown types, independently drawn from action-specific marginal distributions. As in the standard Bayesian persuasion model, the sender has access to additional information regarding the action types, which she can exploit when committing to a (noisy) signaling scheme through which she sends a private signal to each receiver. The novelty of our model is in considering the case where the receivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with utilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After formalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ in the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling scheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a signaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue. We show that computing an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme is NPhard when there are three or more receivers. In contrast with previous hardness results for ex interim persuasion, we show that, for games with two receivers, an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time thanks to a novel algorithm based on the ellipsoid method which we propose.

AB  - Machine learning systems have become popular in fields such as marketing, financing, or data mining. While they are highly accurate, complex machine learning systems pose challenges for engineers and users. Their inherent complexity makes it impossible to easily judge their fairness and the correctness of statistically learned relations between variables and classes. Explainable AI aims to solve this challenge by modelling explanations alongside with the classifiers, potentially improving user trust and acceptance. However, users should not be fooled by persuasive, yet untruthful explanations. We therefore conduct a user study in which we investigate the effects of model accuracy and explanation fidelity, i.e. how truthfully the explanation represents the underlying model, on user trust. Our findings show that accuracy is more important for user trust than explainability. Adding an explanation for a classification result can potentially harm trust, e.g. when adding nonsensical explanations. We also found that users cannot be tricked by high-fidelity explanations into having trust for a bad classifier. Furthermore, we found a mismatch between observed (implicit) and self-reported (explicit) trust.

Our results show that extraverts preferred the emotion-aware chatbot significantly more than introverts. Also, participants reported a higher percentage of positive mood reports when interacting with the empathetic bot. Finally, we provide guidelines for the design of emotion-aware chatbots for potential use in mHealth contexts.

AB  - Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) has become increasingly important in many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and medical diagnosis, where explanations are significantly preferred to help people better understand how machine learning systems work and further enhance their trust towards systems. However, due to the diversified scenarios and subjective nature of explanations, we rarely have the ground truth for benchmark evaluation in IML on the quality of generated explanations. Having a sense of explanation quality not only matters for assessing system boundaries, but also helps to realize the true benefits to human users in practical settings. To benchmark the evaluation in IML, in this article, we rigorously define the problem of evaluating explanations, and systematically review the existing efforts from state-of-the-arts. Specifically, we summarize three general aspects of explanation (i.e., generalizability, fidelity and persuasibility) with formal definitions, and respectively review the representative methodologies for each of them under different tasks. Further, a unified evaluation framework is designed according to the hierarchical needs from developers and end-users, which could be easily adopted for different scenarios in practice. In the end, open problems are discussed, and several limitations of current evaluation techniques are raised for future explorations.

AB  - Public debate forums provide a common platform for exchanging opinions on a topic of interest. While recent studies in natural language processing (NLP) have provided empirical evidence that the language of the debaters and their patterns of interaction play a key role in changing the mind of a reader, research in psychology has shown that prior beliefs can affect our interpretation of an argument and could therefore constitute a competing alternative explanation for resistance to changing one’s stance. To study the actual effect of language use vs. prior beliefs on persuasion, we provide a new dataset and propose a controlled setting that takes into consideration two reader-level factors: political and religious ideology. We find that prior beliefs affected by these reader-level factors play a more important role than language use effects and argue that it is important to account for them in NLP studies of persuasion.

AB  - Developing intelligent persuasive conversational agents to change people's opinions and actions for social good is the frontier in advancing the ethical development of automated dialogue systems. To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system.

AB  - Probabilistic epistemic argumentation allows for reasoning about argumentation problems in a way that is well founded by probability theory. Epistemic states are represented by probability functions over possible worlds and can be adjusted to new beliefs using update operators. While the use of probability functions puts this approach on a solid foundational basis, it also causes computational challenges as the amount of data to process depends exponentially on the number of arguments. This leads to bottlenecks in applications such as modelling opponent's beliefs for persuasion dialogues. We show how update operators over probability functions can be related to update operators over much more compact representations that allow polynomial-time updates.We discuss the cognitive and probabilistic-logical plausibility of this approach and demonstrate its applicability in computational persuasion.

To address these issues, we introduce a novel deep learning based action recognition framework for classifying dangerous lane change behavior in short video clips captured by a monocular camera. We designed a deep spatiotemporal classification network that uses pre-trained state-of-the-art instance segmentation network Mask R-CNN as its spatial feature extractor for this task. The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and shallower final classification layers of the proposed method were trained on a semi-naturalistic lane change dataset with annotated risk labels. A comprehensive comparison of state-of-the-art feature extractors was carried out to find the best network layout and training strategy. The best result, with a 0.937 AUC score, was obtained with the proposed network. Our code and trained models are available open-source.

AB  - Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are versatile tools that have the potential of being used in dialogical argumentation. They could possibly be deployed in tasks such as persuasion for behaviour change (e.g. persuading people to eat more fruit, to take regular exercise, etc.) However, to achieve this, there is a need to develop methods for acquiring appropriate arguments and counterargument that reflect both sides of the discussion. For instance, to persuade someone to do regular exercise, the chatbot needs to know counterarguments that the user might have for not doing exercise. To address this need, we present methods for acquiring arguments and counterarguments, and importantly, meta-level information that can be useful for deciding when arguments can be used during an argumentation dialogue. We evaluate these methods in studies with participants and show how harnessing these methods in a chatbot can make it more persuasive.

AB  - Virtual humans need to be persuasive in order to promote behaviour change in human users. While several studies have focused on understanding the numerous aspects that influence the degree of persuasion, most of them are limited to dyadic interactions. In this paper, we present an evaluation study focused on understanding the effects of multiple agents on user's persuasion. Along with gender and status (authoritative &peer), we also look at type of focus employed by the agent i. e., user-directed where the agent aims to persuade by addressing the user directly and vicarious where the agent aims to persuade the user, who is an observer, indirectly by engaging another agent in the discussion. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the 12 conditions and presented with a persuasive message by one or several virtual agents. A questionnaire was used to measure perceived interpersonal attitude, credibility and persuasion. Results indicate that credibility positively affects persuasion. In general, multiple agent setting, irrespective of the focus, was more persuasive than single agent setting. Although, participants favored user-directed setting and reported it to be persuasive and had an increased level of trust in the agents, the actual change in persuasion score reflects that vicarious setting was the most effective in inducing behaviour change. In addition to this, the study also revealed that authoritative agents were the most persuasive.

Through the combination of high-level lateral decision-making and lowlevel rule-based trajectory modification, a safe and efficient lane change behavior can be achieved. With the setting of our state representation and reward function, the trained agent is able to take appropriate actions in a real-world-like simulator. The generated policy is evaluated on the simulator for 10 times, and the results demonstrate that the proposed rule-based DQN method outperforms the rule-based approach and the DQN method.

AB  - We present the design of an online social skills development interface for teenagers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), who often lack access to social skills training. The interface is intended to enable private conversation practice anywhere, anytime using a browser. Users converse informally with an on-screen persona, receiving feedback on nonverbal cues in real-time, and summary feedback. The prototype was developed in consultation with an expert UX designer, two psychologists, and a pediatrician. Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using the hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers, and through thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.

AB  - A growing body of academic research in the field of behavioural economics, political science and psychology demonstrate how an invisible hand can nudge people’s decisions towards a preferred option. Contrary to the assumptions of the neoclassical economics, supporters of nudging argue that people have problems coping with a complex world, because of their limited knowledge and their restricted rationality. Technological improvement in the age of information has increased the possibilities to control the innocent social media users or penalise private investors and reap the benefits of their existence in hidden persuasion and discrimination. Nudging enables nudgers to plunder the simple uneducated and uninformed citizen and investor, who is neither aware of the nudging strategies nor able to oversee the tactics used by the nudgers (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b). The nudgers are thereby legally protected by democratically assigned positions they hold. The law of motion of the nudging societies holds an unequal concentration of power of those who have access to compiled data and coding rules, relevant for political power and influencing the investor’s decision usefulness (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b). This paper takes as a case the “transparency technology XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)” (Sunstein 2013, 20), which should make data more accessible as well as usable for private investors. It is part of the choice architecture on regulation by governments (Sunstein 2013). However, XBRL is bounded to a taxonomy (Piechocki and Felden 2007).

This paper conceptualizes ethical questions arising from the taxonomy engineering based on machine learning systems: Should the objective of the coding rule be to support or to influence human decision making or rational artificiality? This paper therefore advocates for a democratisation of information, education and transparency about nudges and coding rules (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b).

PY  - 2018
AB  - Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach to extend traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve more complex tasks. Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use off-policy experience for both higher- and lower-level training. This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations,1 learning from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction. In comparisons with a number of prior HRL methods, we find that our approach substantially outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques2.

AB  - Much research in computational argumentation assumes that arguments and counterarguments can be obtained in some way. Yet, to improve and apply models of argument, we need methods for acquiring them. Current approaches include argument mining from text, hand coding of arguments by researchers, or generating arguments from knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call argument harvesting, that uses a chatbot to enter into a dialogue with a participant to get arguments and counterarguments from him or her. Because it is automated, the chatbot can be used repeatedly in many dialogues, and thereby it can generate a large corpus. We describe the architecture of the chatbot, provide methods for managing a corpus of arguments and counterarguments, and an evaluation of our approach in a case study concerning attitudes of women to participation in sport.

AB  - Explainable recommendation attempts to develop models that generate not only high-quality recommendations but also intuitive explanations. The explanations may either be post-hoc or directly come from an explainable model (also called interpretable or transparent model in some contexts). Explainable recommendation tries to address the problem of why: By providing explanations to users or system designers, it helps humans to understand why certain items are recommended by the algorithm, where the human can either be users or system designers. Explainable recommendation helps to improve the transparency, persuasiveness, effectiveness, trustworthiness, and satisfaction of recommendation systems. It also facilitates system designers for better system debugging. In recent years, a large number of explainable recommendation approaches - especially model-based methods - have been proposed and applied in real-world systems.

AU  - Schrader, D.

PY  - 2018
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly permeate human existence, influencing consumer purchases, transportation, work, family life, and social spheres of community and politics. Current news cycles evidence unfavorable effects of AI such as the Parkland conspiracy disclosures and the fake news debates, both of which demonstrate that social media apps can threaten and affect our minds (McKew, 2018; Anderson & Rainie, 2017) despite their prosocial potentialities and design. Likewise, health care apps affect mood, health, and bodies in the detection, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation of disease and wellness (Jiang, et al., 2017), and AI systems in robotics not only help but also threaten our physical safety and bodily well-being (Calo, 2015). Such ubiquitous impacts of AI, both beneficial and detrimental, necessitate policies that guide the future development of AI in a way that can protect humans from both obvious and surreptitious threats. Critically, AI is not currently apparent, transparent, nor in the conscious awareness of many people. Nonetheless AI takes various forms and serves numerous functions for millions. Social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, for example, were designed with pro-social motives, though use marketing to sustain the service providers, maintain user engagement, and derive economic benefit. AI thus has social utility and serves the social good. But it has also exhibited potential for nefarious purposes. For those reasons this paper analyzes potential ethical issues of AI as it is implemented in social media, particularly when the engagement and use of AI is based on the fabrication and consumption of false information, pretenses, or is contrived and intentionally dishonest for persuasive purposes, or is unintentionally deceptive. We examine the beneficial and the risky aspects of AI in selected media, the ethical dimensions of AI including functional utility, human rights such as privacy and protected speech, issues of transparency, authenticity and truth, and issues of responsibility when things ‘go wrong’ when AI systems are the primary decision-makers. Cases such as the spread of political disinformation, conspiracy theories, and online hate speech are examined to illustrate these various ethical issues. Further, we consider policy recommendations that can assure protective and beneficial AI. Based on our ethical analyses of these select cases, we suggest policies to guide the development and use of AI systems with consideration given to the type of function the AI system serves, and the format in which the system is embedded—such as in algorithmic form such as that used in marketing, in monitoring form such as health monitoring, or robotic form where humans and AI systems might be indistinguishable in appearance and function. AI ethics is essential to the protection of the personal, public and social good. Understanding the effects of emerging technologies on personal, social, economic life is critical to determining the regulations that ought to be required. AI development and related policy development should be proactive and beneficial (Baum, 2017) and consider both technological utility and protective functions to humans.

Several smart devices have been delivered by digital health, bundled with telemedicine systems, smartphone and other digital services. While such solutions offer personalised data and suggestions, the real disruptive step comes from the interaction of new digital ecosystem, represented by chatbots. Chatbots will play a leading role by embodying the function of a virtual assistant and bridging the gap between patients and clinicians. Powered by AI and machine learning algorithms, chatbots are forecasted to save healthcare costs when used in place of a human or assist them as a preliminary step of helping to assess a condition and providing self-care recommendations. This paper describes integrating chatbots into telemedicine systems intended for elderly patient after their hospital discharge. The paper discusses possible ways to utilise chatbots to assist healthcare providers and support patients with their condition.

AB  - The aim of behaviour change is to help people to change aspects of their behaviour for the better (e.g., to decrease calorie intake, to drink in moderation, to take more exercise, to complete a course of antibiotics once started, etc.). In current persuasion technology for behaviour change, the emphasis is on helping people to explore their issues (e.g., through questionnaires or game playing) or to remember to follow a behaviour change plan (e.g., diaries and email reminders). However, recent developments in computational persuasion are leading to an argument-centric approach to persuasion that can potentially be harnessed in behaviour change applications. In this paper, we review developments in computational persuasion, and then focus on domain modelling as a key component. We present a multi-dimensional approach to domain modelling. At the core of this proposal is an ontology which provides a representation of key factors, in particular kinds of belief, which we have identified in the behaviour change lit ENGLerature as being important in diverse behaviour change initiatives. Our proposal for domain modelling is intended to facilit ENGLate the acquisition and representation of the arguments that can be used in persuasion dialogues, together with meta-level information about them which can be used by the persuader to make strategic choices of argument to present.

PY  - 2018
AB  - A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion - the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation by interacting parties in a network: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider interventions that modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. In this work, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and we formalize the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of susceptibility. Specifically, we ask: Given an opinion dynamics model, and a set of agents, each of whom has an innate opinion that reflects the agent's intrinsic position on a topic and a susceptibility-to-persuasion parameter measuring the agent's propensity for changing his or her opinion, how should we modify the agents' susceptibilities in order to maximize (or minimize) the total sum of opinions at equilibrium? We study both the version when there is not a budget on the number of agents that we can target, and when there is. For the former, we provide a polynomial time algorithm for both the maximization and the minimization formulations. In contrast, we show that budgeted version is NP-hard, but unlike prior work focusing on opinion maximization, our objective function is neither sub- nor super-modular in the target set. For this version, we propose a greedy heuristic that we compare experimentally against natural baseline methods. On the experimental side, we perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on several datasets, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates. Our experimental findings show that our proposed tools outperform natural baselines and can achieve a multi-fold effect on the total sum of opinions in the network.

In support of these goals, researchers evaluate model explanation performance using humans and real world applications. This alone presents a challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence. In this position paper, we propose a distinction between descriptive and persuasive explanations. We discuss reasoning suggesting that functional interpretability may be correlated with cognitive function and user preferences. If this is indeed the case, evaluation and optimization using functional metrics could perpetuate implicit cognitive bias in explanations that threaten transparency. Finally, we propose two potential research directions to disambiguate cognitive function and explanation models, retaining control over the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.

AB  - The ability to modulate vocal sounds and generate speech is one of the features which set humans apart from other living beings. The human voice can be characterized by several attributes such as pitch, timbre, loudness, and vocal tone. It has often been observed that humans express their emotions by varying different vocal attributes during speech generation. Hence, deduction of human emotions through voice and speech analysis has a practical plausibility and could potentially be beneficial for improving human conversational and persuasion skills. This paper presents an algorithmic approach for detection and analysis of human emotions with the help of voice and speech processing. The proposed approach has been developed with the objective of incorporation with futuristic artificial intelligence systems for improving human-computer interactions.

AB  - Quantum cognition in decision-making is a recent and rapidely growing field. In this paper we develop an expected utility theory in a context of non-classical (quantum) uncertainty. We replace the classical state space with a Hilbert space which allows introducing the concept of quantum lottery. Within that framework we formulate axioms on preferences over quantum lotteries to establish a representation theorem. We show that demanding the consistency of choice behavior conditional on new information is equivalent to the von Neuman-Lüders postulate applied to beliefs. A dynamically consistent quantum-like agent may violate dynamic recursive consistency, however. This feature suggests interesting applications in behavioral economics as we illustrate in an example of persuasion.

TI  - Explainable Recommendation: Theory and Applications
AU  - Yongfeng, Z.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Although personalized recommendation has been investigated for decades of years, the wide adoption of Latent Factor Models (LFM) has made the explainability of recommendations an important and critical issue to both the research community and practical application of recommender systems. For example, in many practical systems the algorithm just provide a personalized item recommendation list to the users, without persuasive personalized explanation about why such an item is recommended while another is not. Unexplainable recommendations introduce negative effects to the trustworthiness of recommender systems, and thus affect the effectiveness of recommendation engines. In this work, we investigate explainable recommendation in aspects of data explainability, model explainability, and result explainability, and the main contributions are as follows:1. Data Explainability: Data input is the first step of typical recommender systems, and user-item rating matrix is the most basic data format for most personalized recommendation algorithms, especially for Matrix Factorization (MF)-based approaches. In this work, we propose Localized Matrix Factorization (LMF) framework based Bordered Block Diagonal Form (BBDF) matrices, and further applied this technique for parallelized matrix factorization. Traditional MF algorithms treat the original rating matrix as a whole for factorization, without specific understanding of the inherent structure embedded therein. In this work, however, we propose the (recursive) BBDF structure of sparse matrices, and formally prove its equivalence with community detection on bipartite graphs, with which to explain the inherent community structures and their relationships in sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose the LMF framework, and prove its compatibility with most of the traditional MF algorithms, which makes it a unified parallelization framework for matrix factorization, that improves both the effect and efficiency at the same time.2. Model Explainability: Based on user-item rating matrices, personalized recommendation algorithms attempt to model user preferences and make personalized recommendations. In this work, we propose Explicit Factor Models (EFM) based on phrase-level sentiment analysis, as well as dynamic user preference modeling based on time series analysis. For their prediction accuracy and scalability, Latent Factor Models (LFM) based on MF have achieved wide application in real-world systems. However, due to their inherently latent factors, it is usually difficult for LFM to provide intuitively understandable explanations to the recommendation algorithms and results, which reduces the persuasiveness of recommendations. In this work, we extract product features and user opinions towards different features from large-scale user textual reviews based on phrase-level sentiment analysis techniques, and introduce the EFM approach for explainable model learning and recommendation. Because user preference on features may change over time, we conduct dynamic user modeling based on time series analysis, so as to construct explainable dynamic recommendations.3. Economic Explainability: Based on data analysis and user preference modeling, recommender systems actually manipulate the way that items are matched with users, and eventually affect the economic benefits of the online economic system. In this work, we propose the Total Surplus Maximization (TSM) framework for personalized recommendation, as well as the model specification in different types of online applications. More and more human activities are experiencing the continuous progressing from offline to online, and many commonly used online applications can be formalized into the’producer–service–consumer’ framework. For example, in E-commerce websites online retailers (producers) provide normal goods (services), and the users (consumers) thus make choices and purchases from the vast amount of online services. Based on basic economic concepts, we provide the definitions of utility, cost, and surplus in the application scenario of Web services, and propose the general framework of web total surplus calculation and maximization. Further more, we specific the total surplus maximization framework to different types of online applications, i.e., E-commerce, P2P lending, and online freelancing services. Experimental results on real-world datasets verify that our TSM framework is able to improve the recommendation performance and at the same time benefit the social good of the Web.With the continuous growth of the Web, Personalized Recommender Systems (PRS) have been the important building blocks of many online web applications, which contribute to our daily lives in various manners. For example, the product recommendation engines in E-commerce websites recommend potentially interesting products to users, friend recommendation helps to find and connect users in social networks, video recommendation in video sharing websites help users to find favourite videos more quickly and efficiently, and news recommendation in news portals push the latest news to users according to their personalized information needs. In a way, personalized recommendation has become one of the most basic supportive techniques in the era of web intelligence.

A less studied area is a pragmatic approach to the role of humans in a complex modern industrial environment where ML based systems are developed. Key stakeholders affect the system from inception and up to operation and maintenance. Product managers want to embed “smart” experiences for their users and drive the decisions on what should be built next; software engineers are challenged to build or utilise ML software tools that require skills that are well outside of their comfort zone; legal and risk departments may influence design choices and data access; operations teams are requested to maintain ML systems which are non-stationary in their nature and change behaviour over time; and finally ML practitioners should communicate with all these stakeholders to successfully build a reliable system. This paper discusses some of the challenges we faced in Atlassian as we started investing more in the ML space.

AB  - Hierarchical models are utilized in a wide variety of problems which are characterized by task hierarchies, where predictions on smaller subtasks are useful for trying to predict a final task. Typically, neural networks are first trained for the subtasks, and the predictions of these networks are subsequently used as additional features when training a model and doing inference for a final task. In this work, we focus on improving learning for such hierarchical models and demonstrate our method on the task of speaker trait prediction. Speaker trait prediction aims to computationally identify which personality traits a speaker might be perceived to have, and has been of great interest to both the Artificial Intelligence and Social Science communities. Persuasiveness prediction in particular has been of interest, as persuasive speakers have a large amount of influence on our thoughts, opinions and beliefs. In this work, we examine how leveraging the relationship between related speaker traits in a hierarchical structure can help improve our ability to predict how persuasive a speaker is. We present a novel algorithm that allows us to backpropagate through this hierarchy. This hierarchical model achieves a 25% relative error reduction in classification accuracy over current state-of-the art methods on the publicly available POM dataset.

AB  - The act of persuasion, a key component in rhetoric argumentation, may be viewed as a dynamics modifier. We extend Dung’s frameworks with acts of persuasion among agents, and consider interactions among attack, persuasion and defence that have been largely unheeded so far. We characterise basic notions of admissibilities in this framework, and show a way of enriching them through, effectively, CTL (computation tree logic) encoding, which also permits importation of the theoretical results known to the logic into our argumentation frameworks. Our aim is to complement the growing interest in coordination of static and dynamic argumentation.
