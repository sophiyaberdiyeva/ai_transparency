Metadiscursive nouns in academic argument: ChatGPT vs student practices,"Jiang, F.K.; Hyland, K.","The ability of ChatGPT to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts has generated considerable anxiety among those concerned that students might use such large language models (LLMs) to write their assignments. The extent to which LLMs can mimic human writers is starting to be explored, but we know little about their ability to use nominal resources to create effective academic texts. This study investigates metadiscursive nouns in argumentative essays, comparing how ChatGPT and university students employ these devices to organise text, express stance, and construct persuasive arguments. By analysing 145 essays from each source, we examine the syntactic patterns, interactive functions, and interactional uses of metadiscursive nouns. The analysis reveals that while overall frequencies were similar, ChatGPT has distinct preferences for simpler syntactic constructions (particularly the determiner + N pattern) and relies heavily on anaphoric references, whereas students demonstrate more balanced syntactic distribution and greater use of cataphoric references. Interactionally, ChatGPT prefers manner nouns for descriptive precision, while students favour status nouns for evaluative reasoning and evidential nouns for empirical grounding. These findings show that, while structurally coherent, LLM-generated texts often lack the rhetorical flexibility and evaluative sophistication of human academic writing, offering valuable insights for EAP pedagogy. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,,Journal of English for Academic Purposes,75,,,,10.1016/j.jeap.2025.101514,,#4531,Jiang 2025,,,0
Mind the Gap! Choice Independence in Using Multilingual LLMs for Persuasive Co-Writing Tasks in Different Languages,"Biswas, S.; Erlei, A.; Gadiraju, U.","Recent advances in generative AI have precipitated a proliferation of novel writing assistants. These systems typically rely on multilingual large language models (LLMs), providing globalized workers the ability to revise or create diverse forms of content in different languages. However, there is substantial evidence indicating that the performance of multilingual LLMs varies between languages. Users who employ writing assistance for multiple languages are therefore susceptible to disparate output quality. Importantly, recent research has shown that people tend to generalize algorithmic errors across independent tasks, violating the behavioral axiom of choice independence. In this paper, we analyze whether user utilization of novel writing assistants in a charity advertisement writing task is affected by the AI's performance in a second language. Furthermore, we quantify the extent to which these patterns translate into the persuasiveness of generated charity advertisements, as well as the role of peoples' beliefs about LLM utilization for their donation choices. Our results provide evidence that writers who engage with an LLM-based writing assistant violate choice independence, as prior exposure to a Spanish LLM reduces subsequent utilization of an English LLM. While these patterns do not affect the aggregate persuasiveness of the generated advertisements, people's beliefs about the source of an advertisement (human versus AI) do. In particular, Spanish-speaking female participants who believed that they read an AI-generated advertisement strongly adjusted their donation behavior downwards. Furthermore, people are generally not able to adequately differentiate between human-generated and LLM-generated ads. Our work has important implications on the design, development, integration, and adoption of multilingual LLMs as assistive agents - particularly in writing tasks. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2025,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings ,,,,,10.1145/3706598.3713201,,#4532,Biswas 2025,,,0
Enhancing Trust and Empathy in Marketing: Strategic AI and Human Influencer Selection for Optimized Content Persuasion,"Zhang, Y.; Zhu, J.; Chen, H.; Jiang, Y.","Compared to human influencers, AI influencers offer advantages such as low cost, high efficiency, and fairer handling of objective tasks. However, they are believed to have shortcomings in perception and empathy abilities. How can companies select the more appropriate promoter between AI influencers and human influencers based on their marketing content? How can enterprises design more persuasive marketing content according to the type of influencer? Three behavioral experiments were conducted in this paper. The results indicate that when AI influencers post marketing content with functional advertising appeal, they can significantly enhance people's perceived trust. When human influencers share marketing content with experiential advertising appeal, they can significantly improve people's perceived empathy. Consumers with lower levels of knowledge are more susceptible to the matching effect of influencer type and advertising appeal type on the persuasive effect of marketing content than those with higher levels of knowledge. The conclusions of this study assist enterprises in scientifically matching influencer types with advertising appeals. By choosing influencers based on the nature of the marketing content or designing suitable marketing content based on the influencer type, companies can maximize marketing effectiveness. This refined marketing strategy not only improves the persuasive effect of the marketing content but also strengthens the brand's market competitiveness. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2025,,Journal of Consumer Behaviour,24,2,866-885,,10.1002/cb.2423,,#4533,Zhang 2025,,,0
Unlocking the power of multimodal online reviews: A multisensory perspective,"Sun, S.; Sun, H.; Xu, H.; Li, H.; Wang, S.","Multimodal online reviews have been an essential marketing tool for dominating consumer perception. However, the precise impact of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory cues in multimodal content on consumers’ perceived review usefulness remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how text and image contents affect review usefulness from a multisensory perspective. To this end, we proposed a framework that combined machine learning and multimodal large language models to quantify the multisensory elements conveyed through review text and images. Based on the Poisson regression model, the estimation results show that while multisensory elements in text and images have a generally consistent impact on consumer perception, each sensory element carries distinct value. Furthermore, the sensory discrepancy in text and images has a negative effect on the perceived review usefulness. Our findings contribute theoretically to enhancing review persuasion effect and sensory marketing literature. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,,Tourism Management,111,,,,10.1016/j.tourman.2025.105206,,#4534,Sun 2025,,,0
Precision nudging: The future of behaviour change?,"Themistocleous, C.; Karapanos, E.","Behavioural science literature has seen the recent emergence of nudge theory, a proposition that behaviour change can be achieved by altering the 'choice architecture' of our physical and digital environments while considering the boundaries of human rationality. This chapter advocates the term 'precision nudging', the use of artificial intelligence to advance the efficacy of nudges while mitigating their adverse effects. It discusses two methods of precision nudging, tailoring and timing, and their potential in addressing adverse effects, in particular, behavioural spillovers and misfires. In doing so, the authors categorize nudges as reactive ones that aim at improving adverse effects and proactive ones that aim to shield individuals from future spillovers and misfires. © CAB International 2025.

"Nutritional intelligence in the food system: Combining food, health, data and AI expertise","McCarthy, D.I.","Transformative change is needed across the food system to improve health and environmental outcomes. As food, nutrition, environmental and health data are generated beyond human scale, there is an opportunity for technological tools to support multifactorial, integrated, scalable approaches to address the complexities of dietary behaviour change. Responsible technology could act as a mechanistic conduit between research, policy, industry and society, enabling timely, informed decision making and action by all stakeholders across the food system. Domain expertise in food, nutrition and health should always be integrated into both the development and continuous deployment of AI-powered nutritional intelligence (NI) to ensure it is responsible, accurate, safe, useable and effective. Dietary behaviours are complex and improving diet-related health outcomes requires socio-cultural-demographic considerations within the design and deployment of NI tools. This article describes existing examples of NI within the food system and future opportunities. Human-in-the-loop approaches with food, health and nutrition experts involved at all stages including data acquisition, processing, output validation and ongoing quality assurance are essential to ensure evidence-based practice. The same ethical considerations should apply in this domain as in any other (e.g. privacy, inclusivity, robustness, transparency and accountability) and responsible practice must encompass rigorous standards and alignment with regulatory frameworks. Critical today and in the future is accessibility to appropriate high-quality food compositional data sets, which include up-to-date information on commercially available products that reflect the constantly evolving food landscape to realise the potential of responsible AI to help address the existing food system challenges. © 2025 The Author(s).

Jupybara: Operationalizing a Design Space for Actionable Data Analysis and Storytelling with LLMs,"Wang, H.W.; Birnbaum, L.; Setlur, V.","Mining and conveying actionable insights from complex data is a key challenge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and storytelling. To address this challenge, we present a design space for actionable EDA and storytelling. Synthesizing theory and expert interviews, we highlight how semantic precision, rhetorical persuasion, and pragmatic relevance underpin effective EDA and storytelling. We also show how this design space subsumes common challenges in actionable EDA and storytelling, such as identifying appropriate analytical strategies and leveraging relevant domain knowledge. Building on the potential of LLMs to generate coherent narratives with commonsense reasoning, we contribute Jupybara, an AI-enabled assistant for actionable EDA and storytelling implemented as a Jupyter Notebook extension. Jupybara employs two strategies - design-space-aware prompting and multi-agent architectures - to operationalize our design space. An expert evaluation confirms Jupybara's usability, steerability, explainability, and reparability, as well as the effectiveness of our strategies in operationalizing the design space framework with LLMs. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2025,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings ,,,,,10.1145/3706598.3713913,,#4542,Wang 2025,,,0

An iterative optimization method for sustainable environmental improvement under mixed CAV-HDV traffic,"Dong, C.; Hu, P.; Li, N.; Chen, W.; Li, Y.; Ni, D.; Xie, N.; Wang, H.","This paper proposes an iterative optimization method for trajectory control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) at an off-ramp bottleneck, aiming to improve energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the traffic system. The methodology integrates real-world data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset and generated data from each iteration. A comprehensive cost function is developed to evaluate safety, efficiency, comfort, equilibrium, lane-changing, energy, and emissions. The lane-changing process is divided into two stages: lane-changing decision-making (LCD) and lane-changing execution (LCE), modeled using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Specifically, gcForest is applied to model LCD, while long short-term memory (LSTM) is used for LCE, allowing for more precise control of lane-changing behavior. The analysis considers fuel consumption and key vehicular emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter (PM). The results indicate that energy consumption and pollutant emissions are reduced by 20 % after three iterations of optimization. Furthermore, the iterative method demonstrates significant environmental improvements, particularly when the CAV market penetration rate (MPR) reaches approximately 50 %. Higher MPR levels further enhance the sustainability benefits of CAVs, making them more advantageous for promoting sustainable traffic development. © 2025",2025,,Energy,322,,,,10.1016/j.energy.2025.135552,,#4544,Dong 2025,,,0
Can deepfakes manipulate us? Assessing the evidence via a critical scoping review,"Ching, D.; Twomey, J.; Aylett, M.P.; Quayle, M.; Linehan, C.; Murphy, G.","Deepfakes are one of the most recent developments in misinformation technology and are capable of superimposing one person’s face onto another in video format. The potential of this technology to defame and cause harm is clear. However, despite the grave concerns expressed about deepfakes, these concerns are rarely accompanied with empirical evidence. We present a scoping review of the existing empirical studies that aim to investigate the effects of viewing deepfakes on people’s beliefs, memories, and behaviour. Five databases were searched, producing an initial sample of 2004 papers, from which 22 relevant papers were identified, varying in methodology and research methods used. Overall, we found that the early studies on this topic have often produced inconclusive findings regarding the existence of uniquely persuasive or convincing effects of deepfake exposure. Moreover, many experiments demonstrated poor methodology and did not include a non-deepfake comparator (e.g., text-based misinformation). We conclude that speculation and scare mongering about dystopian uses of deepfake technologies has far outpaced experimental research that assess these harms. We close by offering insights on how to conduct improved empirical work in this area. © 2025 Ching et al.

Interventions for reducing exposure to air pollution from landscape fires in a changing environment: A systematic review,"Goodman, N.; Campbell, S.; Tong, M.; Cameron, D.; Brain, M.; Borchers Arriagada, N.; Wheeler, A.J.; Matthews, V.; Saini, B.; Laachir, K.; Walsh, E.; Johnston, F.H.; Vardoulakis, S.","Emissions from more frequent and prolonged landscape fires (wildfires, risk reduction fires, agricultural burning) can expose populations to high levels of air pollution and exacerbate a range of health conditions. This systematic review aims to map, evaluate, and synthesise the scientific literature reporting interventions that can reduce exposure to landscape fire smoke (LFS). Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science and reviewed relevant literature published until March 2024. Thirty-three studies from four countries met the eligibility criteria. Of the interventions evaluated, air filtration was the most frequently reported, and included use of portable air cleaners (PACs) with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ventilation systems with standard and upgraded filters, and low-cost fan filter units (FFU). The effectiveness of PACs for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reduction ranged between 54 %–92 %. In naturally ventilated residences, concentrations of PM2.5 were 0–44 % lower indoors, and depended on the duration of LFS, building operation, and permeability. Mechanical ventilation with minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 5/8 filters in buildings reduced LFS PM2.5 levels by 18–58 %; however, use of higher rated filters (e.g., MERV 12/13) achieved reductions of up to 87 %. Communication interventions, including smartphone apps and alerts/messages from various media sources (e.g., radio, television, internet) had mixed results; nevertheless, inclusion of spirometry and asthma control surveys during app use could improve health outcomes for vulnerable groups. The efficacy of facemasks (N95/P2) was up to 94 % for single pass PM2.5 removal, although they were relatively underutilised. Clean air shelters in public buildings can potentially provide a place for exposure reduction and social support, but have not been sufficiently tested during LFS events.

Food mukbang on social media: towards an AI-driven persuasive interventions for living healthy on social media,"Ataguba, G.; Kalu, I.; Chan, G.; Orji, R.","Social media has witnessed different eating practices, including food mukbang. Food mukbang is a type of video presentation where hosts consume large quantities of food while interacting with viewers. This study is situated on the social eating theory, which explains how people connect their individual interests with society. Though this practice has been on social media platforms for a while now, little is known about its health impact on a wide range of audiences. Unhealthy eating practices are associated with obesity and other chronic diseases, which are the leading causes of death in the world today. Given that there are unhealthy eating practices in food mukbang videos on social media, we collected thirty (30) food mukbang creative common license YouTube videos, and we extracted 2297 comments from these videos to study the trends. In view of this, we found that there is a collection of more unhealthy foods eaten to entertain viewers, different unhealthy eating behaviors such as eating quickly, talking while eating, and putting too much food in the mouth. In addition, we found that the viewers’ sentiments were positive, and they loved watching these videos. Hence, in its best practice, we propose an AI-driven persuasive intervention because AI technologies are capable of detecting unhealthy eating patterns and persuasive interventions can promote a change in behavior (healthy eating behavior). Based on our findings, we present three design recommendations for YouTube and other social media designers to consider in future: (1) using artificial intelligence-related technologies for predicting videos, (2) using natural language processing to prompt feedback, and (3) auto-generating disclaimers at the beginning and end of the video. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.",2025,,AI and Society,40,5,3295-3316,,10.1007/s00146-025-02183-3,,#4548,Ataguba 2025,,,0
Human Delegation Behavior in Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of Contextual Information,"Spitzer, P.; Holstein, J.; Hemmer, P.; Vössing, M.; Kühl, N.; Martin, D.; Satzger, G.","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human decision-making processes at the workplace presents both opportunities and challenges. One promising approach to leverage existing complementary capabilities is allowing humans to delegate individual instances of decision tasks to AI. However, enabling humans to delegate instances effectively requires them to assess several factors. One key factor is the analysis of both their own capabilities and those of the AI in the context of the given task. In this work, we conduct a behavioral study to explore the effects of providing contextual information to support this delegation decision. Specifically, we investigate how contextual information about the AI and the task domain influence humans’ delegation decisions to an AI and their impact on the human-AI team performance. Our findings reveal that access to contextual information significantly improves human-AI team performance in delegation settings. Finally, we show that the delegation behavior changes with the different types of contextual information.

Supporting Procedural Fidelity of Behavioral Interventions for Children With Autism via an Artificial Intelligence Platform,"Yagafarova, A.; Dowling, E.; LaMonica, T.; Hantula, D.A.; Nosek, J.T.; Jimenez-Gomez, C.","Access to behavior analytic services is limited and often unavailable for many in areas with a dearth of qualified providers. Tools to support behavior-change agents located in the natural environment of consumers may be a way to provide behavioral interventions. An artificial intelligence (AI) platform that guides the implementation of behavioral interventions may be useful for supporting procedural fidelity. The current studies evaluated whether an AI platform was effective at increasing and maintaining high levels of procedural fidelity in individuals with little to no prior training. Participants were two behavior technicians in training (Exp. 1) and three caregivers (Exp. 2). Introducing guidance provided by the AI platform GAINS improved the procedural fidelity with which behavior technicians and caregivers implemented behavioral interventions with children with autism, except for one caregiver. These results suggest AI platforms may be useful tools for supporting high levels of procedural fidelity by novice users. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",2025,,Behavioral Interventions,40,1,,,10.1002/bin.2075,,#4555,Yagafarova 2025,,,0
When algorithms meet emotions: Understanding consumer satisfaction in AI companion applications,"Silayach, N.; Ray, R.K.; Singh, N.K.; Dash, D.P.; Singh, A.","AI companion applications are transforming how people form and maintain relationships in the digital world, with millions of users now engaging in emotional and social interactions with AI agents. Understanding what drives user satisfaction becomes crucial as these applications become increasingly integrated into users' daily lives. Drawing on Orlikowski's practice lens theory and employing text mining and hierarchical clustering methodologies on user reviews enhanced with focus group discussions, this study identifies two key determinants of user satisfaction: Functional Capability Perception and Affective Social Attunement. The analysis of 156,637 user reviews and insights from diverse participants reveals that satisfaction emerges through users' simultaneous negotiation of technical proficiency and emotional boundaries in their AI interactions. Functional capabilities positively influence satisfaction, while deeper emotional engagement creates a paradoxical effect where users become more sensitive to AI limitations. The study demonstrates how societal conditions shape these dynamics, with evaluation criteria evolving from simple acceptance to deeper interpersonal connections, reflecting changing attitudes toward human-AI relationships. Our mixed methods approach uncovers the contextual factors and usage patterns that shape how users integrate these technologies into their daily routines and emotional ecosystems. These insights advance our understanding of human-AI relationships while providing practical guidance for developers on creating adaptive systems that respond to evolving user needs. By understanding these complex dynamics, stakeholders can develop AI companions that enhance human relationships rather than attempting to replace them. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,85,,,,10.1016/j.jretconser.2025.104298,,#4556,Silayach 2025,,,0
"Artificial intelligence in tobacco control: A systematic scoping review of applications, challenges, and ethical implications","Olawade, D.B.; Aienobe-Asekharen, C.A.","Background: Tobacco use remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach. Objective: To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications. Method: This scoping review followed the Arksey and O'Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening. Results: AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact. Conclusion: AI holds considerable promise for extending tobacco control if implemented ethically, transparently, and collaboratively. Future directions emphasize explainable AI development, integration of real-time intervention systems, global data inclusion, and robust cross-sector collaboration. While the current landscape shows a laudable start, it reflects the need for more diverse skill sets to fully harness AI's extensive prospects for tobacco control and achieving tobacco endgame goals. © 2025 The Author(s)",2025,,International Journal of Medical Informatics,202,,,,10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2025.105987,,#4558,Olawade 2025,,,0
Enhancing legal writing skills: The impact of formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment,"Weber, F.; Wambsganss, T.; Söllner, M.","Abstract: Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced educational technologies, reshaping the teaching and learning landscape. However, the notion of fully automating the teaching process remains contentious. This paper explores the concept of hybrid intelligence (HI), which emphasizes the synergistic collaboration between AI and humans to optimize learning outcomes. Despite the potential of AI-enhanced learning systems, their application in a human-AI collaboration system often fails to meet anticipated standards, and there needs to be more empirical evidence showcasing their effectiveness. To address this gap, this study investigates whether formative feedback in an HI learning environment helps law students learn from their errors and write more structured and persuasive legal texts. We conducted a field experiment in a law course to analyse the impact of formative feedback on the exam results of 43 law students, as well as on the writer (students), the writing product and the writing process. In the control group, students received feedback conforming to the legal common practice, where they solved legal problems and subsequently received general feedback from a lecturer based on a sample solution. Students in the treatment group were provided with formative feedback that specifically targeted their individual errors, thereby stimulating internal cognitive processes within the students. Our investigation revealed that participants who were provided with formative feedback rooted in their errors within structured and persuasive legal writing outperformed the control group in producing qualitative, better legal text during an exam. Furthermore, the analysed qualitative student statements also suggest that formative feedback promotes students' self-efficacy and self-regulated learning. Our findings indicate that integrating formative feedback rooted in individual errors enhances students' legal writing skills. This underscores the hybrid nature of AI, empowering students to identify their errors and improve in a more self-regulated manner. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Collaboration between humans and AI in educational settings advances learning mutually, fostering a unified developmental process. Collaborative education models advocate leveraging human and AI strengths for adaptive learning. Despite abundant theoretical research, empirical studies in HI remain limited. This gap underscores the need for more evidence-based approaches in integrating AI into educational settings. What this paper adds Field experiment investigating the impact of formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment based on the theory of learning from errors. Comparison of a traditional legal learning environment (lecturer teaching using sample solutions) versus formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment. Implementing formative machine learning-based feedback supports law students in producing more structured and persuasive legal texts, leading to enhanced exam performance and higher grades. Implications for practice and/or policy Our research contributes significantly to computer-based education by presenting empirical evidence of how formative writing feedback impacts students' legal knowledge and skills in educational settings. This underscores the importance of incorporating empirical data into the development of AI-based educational tools to ensure their effectiveness. By focusing on individual errors corrected by formative feedback, we contribute to the learning from errors literature stream. This perspective offers valuable insights into how such feedback can support students' writing and learning processes, filling a gap in empirical evidence. Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of ML-based learning systems, particularly in large-scale learning environments like legal mass lectures.

CAUSATION AND ARGUMENTATION,"Bochman, A.; Cerutti, F.; Rienstra, T.","Causality is a feature in a socio-economical context rapidly moving towards an ethical use of robust artificial intelligence. The primary link between causation and argumentation, especially in AI, stems from the fundamental role of causality in explanations, as argued in several works in the explainable artificial intelligence literature. In this sense, theories of causation naturally sug-gest themselves as an essential component of explainable artificial intelligence. Causality also directly supports what-if and counterfactual reasoning, fundamental components for fair, robust, and resilient use of artificial intelligence tools and systems. Because of its connection with the enquiry, persuasion, and negotiation monologues and dialogues, this article popularizes the fundamental concepts of causality for the computational argumentation research community. It also accounts for the approaches to address research questions at the heart of both argumentation and causality communities, including the connections between causal models and formal argumentation approaches. © 2025, College Publications.

User-Driven Value Alignment: Understanding Users' Perceptions and Strategies for Addressing Biased and Discriminatory Statements in AI Companions,"Fan, X.; Xiao, Q.; Zhou, X.; Pei, J.; Sap, M.; Lu, Z.; Shen, H.","Content Warning: This paper presents textual examples that may be offensive or upsetting.Large language model-based AI companions are increasingly viewed by users as friends or romantic partners, leading to deep emotional bonds. However, they can generate biased, discriminatory, and harmful outputs. Recently, users are taking the initiative to address these harms and re-align AI companions. We introduce the concept of user-driven value alignment, where users actively identify, challenge, and attempt to correct AI outputs they perceive as harmful, aiming to guide the AI to better align with their values. We analyzed 77 social media posts about discriminatory AI statements and conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users. Our analysis revealed six common types of discriminatory statements perceived by users, how users make sense of those AI behaviors, and seven user-driven alignment strategies, such as gentle persuasion and anger expression. We discuss implications for supporting user-driven value alignment in future AI systems, where users and their communities have greater agency. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2025,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings ,,,,,10.1145/3706598.3713477,,#4562,Fan 2025,,,0
System Dynamics Modeling for Diabetes Treatment and Prevention Planning,"Hirani, A.; Guergachi, A.; Keshavjee, K.","The increasing prevalence of preventable chronic disease in Canada poses significant challenges to both healthcare budgets and individual financial stability. New treatments and predictive technologies are creating an urgent need to evaluate the impact of these innovations on population health and healthcare costs. This paper explores the use of system dynamics modeling to analyze the effects of artificial intelligence (AI)driven predictive tools, life-prolonging treatments, and digital behavior change applications on T2D prevalence and healthcare expenditures. Our model simulates three scenarios over a 50-year period, revealing that while AI and novel treatments can reduce complications, they may paradoxically increase T2D prevalence and overall costs unless combined with preventive measures. The study demonstrates the utility of system dynamics models in forecasting the secondary effects of policy decisions, providing policymakers with a valuable tool for evaluating trade-offs and optimizing health outcomes. The findings underscore the need for new tools to effectively manage the evolving landscape of chronic disease treatment and prevention. © 2025 The Authors.",2025,,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,322,,83-84,,10.3233/SHTI250028,,#4563,Hirani 2025,,,0
Efficient Management of LLM-Based Coaching Agents' Reasoning While Maintaining Interaction Quality and Speed,"Göldi, A.; Rietsche, R.; Ungar, L.","LLM-based agents improve upon standalone LLMs, which are optimized for immediate intent-satisfaction, by allowing the pursuit of more extended objectives, such as helping users over the long term. To do so, LLM-based agents need to reason before responding. For complex tasks like personalized coaching, this reasoning can be informed by adding relevant information at key moments, shifting it in the desired direction. However, the pursuit of objectives beyond interaction quality may compromise this very quality. Moreover, as the depth and informativeness of reasoning increase, so do the number of tokens required, leading to higher latency and cost. This study investigates how an LLM-based coaching agent can adjust its reasoning depth using a discrepancy mechanism that signals how much reasoning effort to allocate based on how well the objective is being met. Our discrepancy-based mechanism constrains reasoning to better align with alternative objectives, reducing cost roughly tenfold while minimally impacting interaction quality. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2025,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings ,,,,,10.1145/3706598.3713606,,#4564,Göldi 2025,,,0
PSSD: Making Large Language Models Self-denial via Human Psyche Structure,"Liao, J.; Liao, Z.; Zhao, X.","The enhance of accuracy in reasoning results of LLMs arouses the community’s interests, wherein pioneering studies investigate post-hoc strategies to rectify potential mistakes. Despite extensive efforts, they are all stuck in a state of resource competition demanding significant time and computing expenses. The cause of the situation lies in the failure of identifying the fundamental feature of the solutions in this line, coined as the self-denial of LLMs. In other words, LLMs should confidently determine the potential existence of mistakes and carefully execute the targeted correction. As the whole procedure conducts within LLMs, supporting and persuasive references are hard to acquire, while the absence of specific steps towards refining hidden mistakes persists even when errors are acknowledged. In response to the challenges, we present PSSD, which refers to and implements the human psyche structure such that three distinct and interconnected roles contribute to human reasoning. Specifically, PSSD leverages the recent multi-agent paradigm, and is further enhanced with three innovatively conceived roles: (1) the intuition-based id role that provides initial attempts based on benign LLMs; (2) the rule-driven superego role that summarizes rules to regulate the above attempts, and returns specific key points as guidance; and (3) the script-centric ego role that absorbs all procedural information to generate executable script for the final answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design not only better enhance reasoning capabilities, but also seamlessly integrate with current models, leading to superior performance. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2025,,WWW 2025 - Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference,,,796-806,,10.1145/3696410.3714715,,#4565,Liao 2025,,,0

As an interaction pattern representative of context-aware computing, JITAIs are being explored for their potential to support sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. Challenging traditional JITAI implementation models, which face severe scalability and flexibility limitations, we tested GPT-4 for suggesting JITAIs in the use case of heart-healthy activity in cardiac rehabilitation. Using three personas representing patients affected by CVD with varying severeness and five context sets per persona, we generated 450 JITAI decisions and messages. These were systematically evaluated against those created by 10 laypersons (LayPs) and 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). GPT-4-generated JITAIs surpassed human-generated intervention suggestions, outperforming both LayPs and HCPs across all metrics (i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionalism).

The field is rapidly evolving with technological advances. As new biomarkers are discovered, wearables and other devices can now provide up-to-the-minute insights, and artificial intelligence and machine learning models support recommendations and lifestyle behavior change. Advancements in the field enhance the potential for tailored and effective programs but raise important questions regarding user safety, security, health, transparency, and privacy. The Personalized Nutrition Initiative at the University of Illinois held the workshop, “Challenges for Personalized Nutrition in the Current United States Regulatory Framework and Future Opportunities,” to address regulatory implications of current PN programs, future innovation within the current framework, and existing complexities of oversight. A majority of PN programs combine multiple components, and these components may need to be regulated differently. The areas of food, supplements, in vitro diagnostics, and medical and wellness devices were described and discussed as they apply to PN programs. The speakers and discussants concluded that regulatory guidance for PN programs should focus on ensuring 1) safety and accuracy of the tests and devices, 2) credentialed and skilled experts develop the advice, 3) responsible and clear communication of information and benefits, 4) substantiation of scientific claims, and 5) procedures are implemented to protect user privacy. Furthermore, as this field incorporates new devices, biomarkers, behavior-based tools, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the need to adapt the existing regulatory framework was also considered. Working closely with regulatory bodies is required and should be an opportunity to provide users with transparency, build trust, and create a source of differentiation for PN innovators. © 2025 The Authors",2025,,Advances in Nutrition,16,3,,,10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100382,,#4567,Donovan 2025,,,0
Advancements in Treatment Options for Primary Nocturnal Enuresis,"Soo, E.; Bayne, A.","Purpose of Review: Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a socially isolating and distressing condition for children and their families impacting up to 20% of five year olds. While this condition often improves with age, NE has been shown to impact children’s self-concept while also contributing financial and social stress for the entire household. This review aims to illustrate important considerations for the evaluation of NE, recent developments in treatment options, and factors influencing therapeutic success. Recent Findings: Though enuresis alarms and desmopressin remain the only first line therapies, advancements are being made to improve treatment efficacy. In addition to long-standing adjunctive therapies, new and exciting options are emerging to help families address this common condition. Among these options, medical hypnotherapy may serve as a promising alternative with limited risk of side effects, while artificial intelligence presents the potential for new enuresis alarms. Summary: Treatment success of NE may be influenced by various factors requiring careful assessment of the patient and their family. These factors should be considered when discussing treatment options and the role for adjunctive therapies. Emerging therapies mentioned here, offer exciting options for families seeking effective treatment with reduced risk of side effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2025,,Current Treatment Options in Pediatrics,11,1,,,10.1007/s40746-024-00319-z,,#4570,Soo 2025,,,0

The MOMs Chat & Care Study (R01NR021134) is a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of an integrated care model to facilitate timely, appropriate care for high-risk Black birthing people and reduce the risk for SMM. Methods: We will recruit 674 adult, English and Spanish-speaking Black birthing people who are less than 17 weeks gestational age, considered high risk based on the Obstetrics-Comorbidity Index and/or history of preeclampsia, and receive care at a Northwell Health obstetric practice. Participants will be randomized to either MOMs High Touch or Low Touch. In both intervention arms participants will receive close monitoring via chatbot technology and navigation to timely care and services by the MOMs team throughout the prenatal and postpartum periods, Fitbit to track physical activity, and bi-weekly postpartum telehealth visits up to 6-weeks postpartum. MOMs High Touch will also receive 12 bi-weekly self-management support telehealth visits during pregnancy and a home blood pressure monitor. The two arms will be compared on incidence of SMM at labor and delivery (Aim 1), SMM-related hospitalizations at 1-month and 1-year postpartum (Aim 1a), time to preeclampsia diagnosis and treatment (Aim 2), perceived social support (Aim 3), and physical activity trajectories (exploratory Aim 4). Mixed methods will be used to examine facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation (Aim 5). Conclusion: Findings from this study will inform how to feasibly implement an effective and sustainable integrated care approach to address SMM disparities.

Emulating fundamental analysts: Analytical stage-based multi-agent framework enhanced with expert guidance and Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment,"Xu, T.; Piao, Z.; Mukai, T.; Murayama, Y.; Izumi, K.","With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), some studies have explored their potential for predicting stock prices based on financial texts. However, previous research often overlooked the depth of analysis generated by LLMs, resulting in reasoning processes inferior to those of human analysts. In fundamental investing, which requires in-depth company analysis, conclusions from imperfect reasoning lack persuasiveness. In this study, inspired by the analysis process of human analysts, we propose an “Analytical Stage-Based Multi-Agent Framework” to enable LLMs to perform in-depth fundamental analysis. This framework divides the analysis into multiple stages, assigning an LLM agent to each. We enhance each agent's capabilities for its specific task through expert guidance or fine-tuning, allowing them to collectively emulate the workflow of human analysts. Furthermore, we introduce Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment, a new method for fine-tuning LLMs. This approach addresses the decline in likelihood of generating correct responses that occurs after using existing preference alignment methods. It employs an objective function with two terms: one to increase likelihood and another to preserve aligned preference. We conducted experiments using our framework to analyze company earnings releases. We evaluated the analysis quality based on comprehensiveness and logical soundness, while correctness was assessed by using stock prices as the ground truth to calculate the Matthews correlation coefficient and F1 score. Results demonstrate that even without expert guidance and fine-tuning, our multi-agent framework can enhance LLMs in both analysis quality and correctness. When combined with expert guidance and fine-tuning, the performance is further improved. © 2025",2025,,Intelligent Systems with Applications,26,,,,10.1016/j.iswa.2025.200496,,#4580,Xu 2025,,,0

"Preliminary exploration of ChatGPT-4 shows the potential of generative artificial intelligence for culturally tailored, multilingual antimicrobial resistance awareness messaging","Akinyede, O.; Yustyniuk, V.; Ochwo, S.; Aworh, M.; Wilkins, M.","Objective Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global threat driven by factors such as improper antimicrobial use in humans and animals, is projected to cause 10 million annual deaths by 2050. For behavior change, public health messages must be tailored for diverse audiences. Generative AI may have the potential to create culturally and linguistically suited AMR awareness messages. This study assesses ChatGPT-4’s capability for crafting such content. Methods 4 veterinary public health professionals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds identified top AMR con-tributors and audiences in their countries. A fifth person developed and refined ChatGPT-4 prompts to create AMR awareness content in US English, Ukrainian, Luganda, Ugandan English, Yoruba, and Nigerian Pidgin, using behavior change models. The content was rated for accuracy, applicability, language, cultural fit, originality, clarity, persua-siveness, and overall quality. Results ChatGPT-4 created 2 content types (long and short) per language for social media, television ads, and WhatsApp. Quality ranged from poor to excellent. Shorter content outperformed longer ones. Performance varied across lan-guages, with abysmal results for Yoruba and excellent for Pidgin. Problematic issues like simplistic language and inappropriate terminology were identified. Conclusions ChatGPT-4 has the potential to generate content and training aids. However, the varied quality requires profes-sional verification. Future research should optimize prompts and incorporate expert and audience insights for better results.

Love deepens hatred! AI immorality and users’ love-becomes-hate phenomenon,"Li, J.; Han, M.; Yuan, Q.","With the widespread application of artificial intelligence in the service industry, understanding consumers’ changing attitudes towards AI is crucial. This study explores the impact of AI immorality on the shift from “love-becomes-hate” in consumers, using three scenario-based experiments and framed within the theoretical perspective of the Relationships Breakdown model. In Study 1, cognitive dissonance and perceived betrayal were found to mediate the relationship between AI immorality and the “love-becomes-hate” transition. Studies 2 and 3 further demonstrated that technological mindfulness positively moderated the relationship between AI immorality and cognitive dissonance (Study 2). Specifically, consumers with high levels of technological mindfulness experienced more pungent cognitive dissonance when confronted with AI immorality. Additionally, social judgment positively moderated the relationship between AI immorality and perceived betrayal, with negative social judgment exacerbating the degree of perceived betrayal (Study 3). Overall, AI immorality can lead to a “love-becomes-hate” phenomenon among consumers. This study theoretically fills the gap in the mechanism of AI immorality impact on consumer psychology, expands the application field of the relationship breakdown model, and deepens the understanding of consumer emotional transformation; in practice, it provides enterprises, AI developers, and marketers with an important guide for risk control of AI ethical development, which helps to maintain good human-machine relationship and brand image. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,85,,,,10.1016/j.jretconser.2025.104319,,#4586,Li 2025,,,0
The benefits and dangers of anthropomorphic conversational agents,"Peter, S.; Riemer, K.; West, J.D.","A growing body of research suggests that the recent generation of large language model (LLMs) excel, and in many cases outpace humans, at writing persuasively and empathetically, at inferring user traits from text, and at mimicking human-like conversation believably and effectively—without possessing any true empathy or social understanding. We refer to these systems as “anthropomorphic conversational agents” to aptly conceptualize the ability of LLM-based systems to mimic human communication so convincingly that they become increasingly indistinguishable from human interlocutors. This ability challenges the many efforts that caution against “anthropomorphizing” LLMs, attaching human-like qualities to nonhuman entities. When the systems themselves exhibit human-like qualities, calls to resist anthropomorphism will increasingly fall flat. While the AI industry directs much effort into improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs—with mixed results—the progress in communicative abilities remains underappreciated. In this perspective, we aim to raise awareness for both the benefits and dangers of anthropomorphic agents. We ask: should we lean into the human-like abilities, or should we aim to dehumanize LLM-based systems, given concerns over anthropomorphic seduction? When users cannot tell the difference between human interlocutors and AI systems, threats emerge of deception, manipulation, and disinformation at scale. We suggest that we must engage with anthropomorphic agents across design and development, deployment and use, and regulation and policy-making.

The Application of Artificial Intelligence in Civil Trials: Mechanism Vs.

The pendulum comes to rest when a balance between logic and morality is achieved. Thus, justice is realized when there is stability between logic and morality, as justice is inherently dynamic and functional. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an output of logic, while ethics is an output of morality. Philosophers universally agree that the law must evolve in line wi th societal advancements, particularly in the realms of digital technology and the internet.

Does ChatGPT Write Like a Student? Engagement Markers in Argumentative Essays,"Jiang, F.; Hyland, K.","ChatGPT has created considerable anxiety among teachers concerned that students might turn to large language models (LLMs) to write their assignments. Many of these models are able to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts, thus potentially enabling cheating and undermining literacy and critical thinking skills. This study seeks to explore the extent LLMs can mimic human-produced texts by comparing essays by ChatGPT and student writers. By analyzing 145 essays from each group, we focus on the way writers relate to their readers with respect to the positions they advance in their texts by examining the frequency and types of engagement markers. The findings reveal that student essays are significantly richer in the quantity and variety of engagement features, producing a more interactive and persuasive discourse.

The future of cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agents: new perspectives and trends,"Chen, M.; Guo, B.; Wang, H.; Li, H.; Zhao, Q.; Liu, J.; Ding, Y.; Pan, Y.; Yu, Z.","Persuasion, as one of the crucial abilities in human communication, has garnered extensive attention from researchers within the field of intelligent dialogue systems. Developing dialogue agents that can persuade others to accept certain standpoints is essential to achieving truly intelligent and anthropomorphic dialogue systems. Benefiting from the substantial progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), dialogue agents have acquired an exceptional capability in context understanding and response generation. However, as a typical and complicated cognitive psychological system, persuasive dialogue agents also require knowledge from the domain of cognitive psychology to attain a level of human-like persuasion. Consequently, the cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agent (defined as CogAgent), which incorporates cognitive strategies to achieve persuasive targets through conversation, has become a predominant research paradigm. To depict the research trends of CogAgent, in this paper, we first present several fundamental cognitive psychology theories and give the formalized definition of three typical cognitive strategies, including the persuasion strategy, the topic path planning strategy, and the argument structure prediction strategy. Then we propose a new system architecture by incorporating the formalized definition to lay the foundation of CogAgent. Representative works are detailed and investigated according to the combined cognitive strategy, followed by the summary of authoritative benchmarks and evaluation metrics. Finally, we summarize our insights on open issues and future directions of CogAgent for upcoming researchers. © The Author(s) 2024.",2025,,Frontiers of Computer Science,19,5,,,10.1007/s11704-024-40057-x,,#4594,Chen 2025,,,0

Persuasive Surfaces and Calculating Machines. A Rhetorical Perspective on Artificial Intelligence,"Gottschling, M.; Kramer, O.","This essay examines the communicative implications of generative AI through a rhetorical lens. Rather than asking whether machines can truly ‘think,’ this approach considers how generative AI’s probabilistic outputs construct persuasive textual ‘surfaces’ that interact rhetorically with human communication. Authorship and meaning are no longer localized to a single individual creator but emerge through the interplay of human and machine co-construction of ‘possible worlds.’ By viewing generative AI as a ‘techné’ in the classical sense, we examine how models ‘imitate’ prior texts through algorithmic recombination. As AI accelerates information flows, it becomes increasingly important for individuals to develop rhetorical literacy, to deconstruct the interests and values encoded in AI’s persuasive surfaces. In contrast to the influential but one-directional information-theoretical communication model proposed by Shannon (1948), the essay advocates a rhetorical model of communication that emphasizes the active role of readers in reconstructing possible worlds from textual offers. Rather than neutral vessels of truth, generative AI outputs are inherently contingent yet interest-driven, requiring enhanced communicative competencies to navigate their impacts on changing concepts of reality, authorship, and common ground. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Global Philosophy,35,3,,,10.1007/s10516-025-09748-3,,#4596,Gottschling 2025,,,0

Early detection is important to delay disease progression, timely intervention and to increase patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life (QoL). One of the major and primary challenges for preventing any disease is to identify the disease at the initial stage through a quick and reliable detection process. Different researchers across the world are still working relentlessly, coming up with significant solutions. Artificial intelligence-based solutions are putting great importance on identifying the disease efficiently, where deep learning with medical imaging is highly being utilized to develop disease detection frameworks. In this work, a novel and optimized detection framework has been proposed that comes with remarkable performance that can classify the level of Alzheimer’s accurately and efficiently. Methods: A powerful vision transformer model (ViT-B16) with three efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (VGG19, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetV2B3) has been trained with a benchmark dataset, ‘OASIS’, that comes with a high volume of brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Results: A weighted average ensemble technique with a Grasshopper optimization algorithm has been designed and utilized to ensure maximum performance with high accuracy of 97.31%, precision of 97.32, recall of 97.35, and F1 score of 0.97. Conclusions: The work has been compared with other existing state-of-the-art techniques, where it comes with high efficiency, sensitivity, and reliability.

GLOBAL TRENDS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SEPSIS-RELATED RESEARCH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS,"Hu, X.; Gu, X.; Li, H.; Wang, H.; Tang, D.","Background: In the field of bibliometrics, although some studies have conducted literature reviews and analyses on sepsis, these studies mainly focus on specific areas or technologies, such as the relationship between the gut microbiome and sepsis, or immunomodulatory treatments for sepsis. However, there are still few studies that provide comprehensive bibliometric analyses of global scientific publications related to AI in sepsis research. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the global trend analysis of AI applications in sepsis based on publication output, citations, co-authorship between countries, and co-occurrence of author keywords Methods: A total of 4,382 papers published from 2015 to December 2024 were retrieved and downloaded from the Science Citation Index Expanded database in Web of Science. After selecting the document types as articles and reviews, and conducting eligibility checks on titles and abstracts, the final bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace included 4,209 papers. Results: The number of published papers increased sharply starting in 2021, accounting for 58.14% (2,447/4,209) of all included papers. The United States and China together account for approximately 60.16% (2,532/4,209) of the total publications.

Subjective-probability forecasts of existential risk: Initial results from a hybrid persuasion-forecasting tournament,"Karger, E.; Rosenberg, J.; Jacobs, Z.; Hickman, M.; Tetlock, P.E.","A multi-stage persuasion-forecasting tournament asked specialists and generalists (“superforecasters”) to explain their probability judgments of short- and long-run existential threats to humanity. Specialists were more pessimistic, especially on long-run threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI). Despite incentives to share their best arguments during four months of discussion, neither side materially moved the other's views. This would be puzzling if participants were Bayesian agents methodically sifting through elusive clues about distant futures but it is less puzzling if participants were boundedly rational agents searching for confirmatory evidence as the risks of embarrassing accuracy feedback receded. Consistent with the latter mechanism, strong AI-risk proponents made particularly extreme long- but not short-range forecasts and over-estimated the long-range AI-risk forecasts of others.

LC-LLM: Explainable lane-change intention and trajectory predictions with Large Language Models,"Peng, M.; Guo, X.; Chen, X.; Chen, K.; Zhu, M.; Chen, L.; Wang, F.-Y.","To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a Lane Change-Large Language Model (LC-LLM), an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for understanding driving behavior. © 2025 The Authors",2025,,Communications in Transportation Research,5,,,,10.1016/j.commtr.2025.100170,,#4605,Peng 2025,,,0
The impact of selfish driving behavior of autonomous vehicles on mixed traffic flow,"Wu, Y.; Li, L.; Jiang, C.; Jiang, Y.; Yao, Z.","With the development of automatic control and artificial intelligence technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming more and more intelligent. However, this individual intelligence means that the driving behavior of AVs can be more aggressive and selfish. To investigate the impact of the selfish driving behavior of AVs on the characteristics of mixed traffic flow, this paper proposes a cellular automata model that considers the selfish driving behavior of AVs. First, we analyze the vehicle types‌ in the current mixed traffic flow and develop a universal safety distance model. Then, based on this, a cellular automata model is proposed. This model can not only describe the longitudinal car-following and lateral lane-changing behavior of human-driven vehicles and AVs, but also characterize the selfish degree in the driving behavior of AVs. Finally, simulation experiments are designed to analyze the impact of the selfish driving behavior of AVs on the performance indicators of mixed traffic flow. The results show that: (1) The increase in the penetration rate of AVs has a positive effect on the average velocity, traffic stability, and throughput of mixed traffic flow; (2) On the whole, the selfish lane-changing behavior of AVs has a relatively small impact on the average velocity of mixed traffic flow. The impact becomes smaller with the increase in traffic density. (3) In most scenarios, the selfish car-following behavior of AVs has an improving effect on the average velocity and throughput of mixed traffic flow. In summary, the relevant research results can provide theoretical support for the design of micro-behavioral control schemes for AVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2025,,Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications,672,,,,10.1016/j.physa.2025.130691,,#4606,Wu 2025,,,0
Performance comparison of explainable DQN and DDPG models for cooperative lane change decision-making in multi-intelligent industrial IoT vehicles,"ZHAN, H.-B.","With the rapid advancement of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) technology, efficient and safe vehicular lane-changing decisions have become a focal point of interest for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper investigates the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to deep reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically deep Q-networks (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), for lane-changing decisions in industrial internet of things (IIoT) vehicles. By integrating innovative reward functions, the study assesses the performance differences between these models under various traffic densities and ICV counts in a three-lane highway scenario. The use of XAI feature representations enhances the transparency and interpretability of the models, providing insights into the decision-making process. XAI helps to elucidate how the models arrive at their decisions, improving trust and reliability in automated systems. The research reveals that although the DQN model demonstrates initial superior performance in the early phases of experimentation, the DDPG model outperforms in crucial performance metrics such as average fleet speed, headway, and stability during later stages of training. The DDPG model maintains better control over fleet speed and vehicle spacing in both low-density and high-density traffic environments, showcasing its superior adaptability and efficiency. These findings highlight the DDPG model's enhanced capability to manage dynamic and complex driving environments, attributed to its refined policy learning approach which adeptly balances exploration and exploitation. The novel reward function significantly promotes cooperative lane-changing behaviors among ICVs, optimizing lane change decisions and improving overall traffic flow efficiency. This study not only provides valuable technical support for lane-changing decisions in smart vehicular networks but also lays a theoretical and empirical foundation for the advancement of future ITS. The insights gained from comparing DQN and DDPG models contribute to the ongoing discussion on effective deep learning strategies for real-world ITS applications, potentially guiding future developments in autonomous driving technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.",2025,,Internet of Things (The Netherlands),31,,,,10.1016/j.iot.2025.101552,,#4607,ZHAN 2025,,,0

Simulation-Free Hierarchical Latent Policy Planning for Proactive Dialogues,"He, T.; Liao, L.; Cao, Y.; Liu, Y.; Sun, Y.; Chen, Z.; Liu, M.; Qin, B.","Recent advancements in proactive dialogues have garnered significant attention, particularly for more complex objectives (e.g. emotion support and persuasion). Unlike traditional task-oriented dialogues, proactive dialogues demand advanced policy planning and adaptability, requiring rich scenarios and comprehensive policy repositories to develop such systems. However, existing approaches tend to rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for user simulation and online learning, leading to biases that diverge from realistic scenarios and result in suboptimal efficiency. Moreover, these methods depend on manually defined, context-independent, coarse-grained policies, which not only incur high expert costs but also raise concerns regarding their completeness. In our work, we highlight the potential for automatically discovering policies directly from raw, real-world dialogue records. To this end, we introduce a novel dialogue policy planning framework, LDPP. It fully automates the process from mining policies in dialogue records to learning policy planning. Specifically, we employ a variant of the Variational Autoencoder to discover fine-grained policies represented as latent vectors. After automatically annotating the data with these latent policy labels, we propose an Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in the latent space to develop effective policy planning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LDPP outperforms existing methods on two proactive scenarios, even surpassing ChatGPT with only a 1.8-billion-parameter LLM.

Enhancing thermal energy storage: The impact of inclined enclosure geometry and artificial neural network based modeling on phase change material melting performance,"Abdellatif, H.E.; Khan, S.A.; Belaadi, A.; Ghernaout, D.","This study investigates the heat transfer dynamics and phase change behavior of Lauric acid in different Phase Change Material (PCM) enclosure configurations during the melting process. Four enclosure designs are analyzed: a rectangular enclosure and three enclosures with inclined walls at angles of 30°, 45°, and 60°. A constant temperature of 70 °C is applied to the right wall, with temperature propagation and liquid fraction evolution monitored. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN) trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, are utilized to model and predict the liquid fraction for Case 01, demonstrating the robustness and precision of the proposed solutions. Results indicate that the rectangular enclosure (Case 01) has the longest melting time (11,040 s) and the highest heat storage values, with sensible heat at 64.8KJ and total heat storage at 191.5KJ. Inclined enclosures reduce melting times: 30° (Case 02) achieves 9200 s (16.66 % time saving), 45° (Case 03) reduces further to 8440 s (23.55 % time saving), and 60° (Case 04) reaches 8200 s (25.72 % time saving). Increased inclinations enhance convection currents, accelerating heat transfer and melting. However, these reductions in melting time led to decreased heat storage, with Case 04 having the lowest values (62.41KJ sensible heat and 189.11KJ total heat). Economic analysis, based on the cost-effectiveness metric (Pc), reveals that Case 03 demonstrates the highest economic performance (Pc = 2.66), balancing optimal melting time with high total energy storage. These findings underscore that modifying PCM enclosure shapes enhances both thermal and economic efficiency, highlighting the importance of integrating AI-based modeling with geometric optimization for superior Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system design. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,,Journal of Energy Storage,114,,,,10.1016/j.est.2025.115750,,#4610,Abdellatif 2025,,,0
Improving Students’ Argumentation Skills Using Dynamic Machine-Learning–Based Modeling,"Wambsganss, T.; Janson, A.; Söllner, M.; Koedinger, K.; Leimeister, J.M.","Argumentation is an omnipresent rudiment of daily communication and thinking. The ability to form convincing arguments is not only fundamental to persuading an audience of novel ideas but also plays a major role in strategic decision making, negotiation, and constructive, civil discourse. However, humans often struggle to develop argumentation skills, owing to a lack of individual and instant feedback in their learning process, because providing feedback on the individual argumentation skills of learners is timeconsuming and not scalable if conducted manually by educators. Grounding our research in social cognitive theory, we investigate whether dynamic technology-mediated argumentation modeling improves students’ argumentation skills in the short and long term. To do so, we built a dynamic machine-learning (ML)–based modeling system. The system provides learners with dynamic writing feedback opportunities based on logical argumentation errors irrespective of instructor, time, and location. We conducted three empirical studies to test whether dynamic modeling improves persuasive writing performance more so than the benchmarks of scripted argumentation modeling (H1) and adaptive support (H2). Moreover, we assess whether, compared with adaptive support, dynamic argumentation modeling leads to better persuasive writing performance on both complex and simple tasks (H3). Finally, we investigate whether dynamic modeling on repeated argumentation tasks (over three months) leads to better learning in comparison with static modeling and no modeling (H4). Our results show that dynamic behavioral modeling significantly improves learners’ objective argumentation skills across domains, outperforming established methods like scripted modeling, adaptive support, and static modeling. The results further indicate that, compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower and higher expertise alike. This work provides important empirical findings related to the effects of dynamic modeling and social cognitive theory that inform the design of writing and skill support systems for education. This paper demonstrates that social cognitive theory and dynamic modeling based on ML generalize outside of math and science domains to argumentative writing. © 2024 The Author(s)",2025,,Information Systems Research,36,1,474-507,,10.1287/isre.2021.0615,,#4611,Wambsganss 2025,,,0
Endorsement effectiveness of celebrities’ avatars: Evidence from multiple experiments,"Xue, J.; Liu, M.T.; Song, X.","Recent advances in artificial intelligence have permeated the adoption of avatars in marketing, prompting human celebrities to create virtual representations of themselves in the cyber environment or the Metaverse as an advertising strategy. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence that explicitly substantiates the efficacy of celebrities’ avatars in comparison to human beings and other virtual celebrities. Through five studies (comprising one eye-tracking analysis and four online experiments), we find that human celebrities and their avatars can be equally persuasive. Notably, the indirect effect between the endorser type and consumer attitude via perceived novelty is more pronounced when the psychological distance between the consumer and the human celebrity is distal, resulting in greater enjoyment of the advertisements. This research improves the understanding of avatar endorsement and underscores the competitive nature of avatars, which maintain marketing efficacy comparable to that of human celebrities while appealing to consumers through novelty attributes. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",2025,,Journal of Business Research,199,,,,10.1016/j.jbusres.2025.115544,,#4614,Xue 2025,,,0

We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA.

"Subacute Sclerosing Panencephalitis: Recent Advances in Pathogenesis, Diagnosis, and Treatment","Garg, R.K.; Pandey, S.","Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a relentless progressive brain disorder caused by the persistent presence of mutated measles virus in the central nervous system. The disease typically develops years after primary measles infection, with the highest risk observed in children infected before the age of 2 years. The global incidence of SSPE is notably higher in low- and middle-income countries and in regions with low measles vaccination coverage. The pathogenesis of SSPE involves viral persistence through mutations in viral proteins, enabling immune evasion and cell-to-cell propagation within the brain. Neuroinflammation, immune-mediated damage, and neuronal loss further contribute to disease progression. Clinical manifestations range from progressive cognitive decline and behavioral changes, along with myoclonus, seizures, movement disorders, visual impairment, and, finally, a vegetative state. Diagnosis is confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing elevated antimeasles antibodies, characteristic periodic electroencephalography discharges, and neuroimaging findings like white matter hyperintensities and cerebral atrophy. Treatment remains challenging, with isoprinosine, interferon-α, ribavirin, and newer agents like favipiravir and aprepitant offering new hope. Symptomatic management and palliative care are needed in all patients. SSPE is invariably fatal. Notably, reports of prolonged survival and disease stabilization have been documented, particularly with early and combined therapy. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic's adverse impact on measles vaccination rates highlights the urgent need for robust measles immunization campaigns. Future directions involve exploring antiviral fusion peptide inhibitors and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostic tools to improve early detection, treatment efficacy, and outcome prediction in SSPE.  © 2025 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology.",2025,,Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology,28,2,159-168,,10.4103/aian.aian_1112_24,,#4616,Garg 2025,,,0
Playing for a purpose: A systematic review and framework for gamified sustainability interventions in urban built environments,"Akbarieh, A.; Han, Q.; Klippel, A.","Gamification and serious games are increasingly used to address sustainability challenges in the urban built environment. These innovative solutions offer interactive, experiential approaches to knowledge transfer, behaviour change and stakeholder engagement. However, research on their application remains fragmented and lacks strategic direction. There is no up-to-date, holistic insight into existing gamified interventions, the topics they explore, or their effectiveness. Given the growing interest in this field, the absence of a structured understanding leads to misaligned research and ineffective problem targeting. Furthermore, the intended purposes behind gamified approaches are not well documented. Few theoretical frameworks exist to classify expected outcomes, limiting the development of comparable, thematically interoperable gamified interventions even within a single domain. To address this, the present study conducted a systematic literature review of 133 studies, mapping thematic gaps and overrepresented areas within gamified applications in urban sustainability and circularity (excluding mobility and transportation). The analysis identified matured research areas such as energy efficiency and urban planning, while critical themes such as natural hazards remain underexplored. Following the review, the novel Three Purposes for Gamified Interventions (3P) Framework is presented, which categorises gamified interventions into three distinct purposes: Pedagogy (educational awareness), Persuasion (behavioural change), and Participation (stakeholder co-creation). By aligning themes and purposes, while being anchored in learning, behavioural, and participation frameworks, 3P provides a structured approach for purpose-driven gamified interventions.

Cognitive dissonance in programming education: A qualitative exploration of the impact of generative AI on application-directed learning,"Dawson, M.G.; Deer, R.; Boguslawski, S.","Generative AI tools, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are already being extensively used by students to support their learning and it is important that educators understand what this might mean for higher education practice. In this study, two researchers external to the faculty teaching team conducted in-depth interviews with 12 students in a small European university of applied sciences who have recently undertaken programming learning as part of their undergraduate studies. The aim was to explore how these students were using LLMs to support their learning and their perceptions of its value as a learning tool. A thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data revealed trends in the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using LLMs, as well as different levels of LLM usage, with more cautious use associated with a 'meaning-directed' approach to learning (learning pattern) and more enthusiastic and unrestrained use with 'application-directed' patterns of study. A tension was observed between some application-directed learners’ high use of LLMs and their recognition that this is not optimal for effective learning. The authors argue that Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) can explain how this dissonance may motivate learners toward a dissonance-reducing attitude or behavior change. The conclusion reflects on the implications for teaching practice and offers some recommendations for how educators can increase metacognition, instrumentalize CDT to increase self-regulation, and facilitate meaning-directed learning patterns in the age of generative AI. © 2025 The Authors",2025,,Computers in Human Behavior Reports,19,,,,10.1016/j.chbr.2025.100724,,#4619,Dawson 2025,,,0

Unpacking the impact of AI vs. human-generated review summary on hotel booking intentions,"(Jasper) Jia, S.; Chi, O.H.; Chi, C.G.","This study investigates the impacts of the source of hotel review summary (AI-generated vs. human-generated) on customers' trust, information processing, and booking intentions through three scenario-based experiments involving 764 participants. Study 1 reveals that human-generated (vs. AI-generated) summaries lead to a higher level of trust, which boosts booking intentions. Study 2 finds that with negative reviews, there's no significant difference in booking intentions between AI and human-generated summaries, suggesting trust isn't the sole mediator. Study 3 proposes that information processing effort is a potential mediator. The findings confirm that when review valence is negative, customers invest more cognitive effort when reading AI-generated compared to human-generated summaries. The results challenge the assumption that human-generated reviews are inherently more persuasive.

Collaborative writing based on generative AI models: Revision and deliberation processes in German as a foreign language,"Michel, M.; Bazhutkina, I.; Abel, N.; Strobl, C.","The introduction of generative AI (GenAI, e.g., ChatGPT) has transformed second language (L2) writing practices. Writers need to learn how to critically employ the tools’ affordances to maximise their learning and L2 instructors face the challenge of guiding students through these novel contexts (cf. Sasaki, 2023). Also collaborative writing (CW) interventions have to find ways how to include GenAI as another technology that impacts the effectiveness of CW as an instructional L2 writing tool (cf. Storch, 2022; Su et al., 2023). In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of how GenAI influences revision and deliberation processes during CW within four writing pairs (N = 8; aged 18–23) engaging in a classroom-based intervention that tasked them to compare their own writing with GenAI models. We analysed screen recordings of evolving revision behaviours, changes in text quality as well as joint discussions among pairs. Complementing Strobl, Menke-Bazhutkina, Abel, and Michel (2024), the current paper (i) relates writers’ revision behaviour to text quality evaluated for functional adequacy (Kuiken & Vedder, 2017); and (ii) presents a fine-grained review of dialogues to identify patterns of CW revisions in interaction with GenAI models.

ImaginAItion: Promoting Generative AI Literacy Through Game-Based Learning,"Ma, Q.; Jain, A.; Kim, J.; Chai, M.; Kaufman, G.","The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in our society and everyday life demonstrates the need for greater AI literacy of its potential biases and harms. Although there have been attempts to bring AI literacy to children, commonly via game-based learning, there is still a lack of instruction that aims to encourage a more nuanced understanding of the utility and harm of GenAI systems to a broader audience. To address the gap, we developed the educational game ImaginAItion, inspired by existing popular party game mechanisms such as Telestrations and Caution Signs. In particular, our game targets adults who do not have a deep understanding of GenAI.

A Longitudinal Study of the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on the Managerial Effectiveness of the “Magnificent Seven” Stocks Firms: An Economic Value-Added Approach,"Peprah, W.K.; Rafaliniony, H.; Peprah, P.","This longitudinal study investigated the managerial effectiveness of the “Magnificent Seven” stock firms in enhancing Economic Value Added (EVA) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a within-subject ANOVA analysis on data spanning from 2016 to 2023, this research aimed to explore how managerial decisions within these firms influenced economic profits over time. The study utilized the Stern-Stewart formula for EVA to calculate the average EVA data from 10-K filings of these technology-oriented firms, representing a significant portion of the S&P 500 index, to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their financial performance. Results indicated a large significant effect difference in EVA pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in both the mean value and variability of EVA. The partial eta squared value indicated that the time period accounted for approximately 26.4% of the variance in EVA. This suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on these firms’ EVA, reflecting positively on their managerial decision-making effectiveness in creating economic value. The conclusion highlighted the importance of management efficiency key decisions included leveraging artificial intelligence, maintaining operational agility to mitigate supply chain disruptions, and fostering a culture of innovation in navigating the complexities introduced by the pandemic. It underscored the significant role of external factors such as consumer behavior changes and government policies in influencing company performance. The study recommended exploring how different sectors responded to the pandemic’s challenges, particularly those hit hardest by the crisis.

How effective are depictions of AI? Reflections from an experimental study in science communication,"Romele, A.; Severo, M.","The images used to depict artificial intelligence (AI) in science communication and marketing are often criticized for their stereotypical nature, yet their actual effectiveness remains an open question. Rather than reiterating existing critiques, this paper examines whether these images truly influence public perception and, if so, how different types of AI representations—particularly stock images—compare in their effectiveness. Drawing on Aristotelian rhetoric, we conceptualize effectiveness through three persuasive dimensions: logos (explanatory clarity), ethos (credibility and engagement), and pathos (emotional impact). To investigate these aspects, we conducted an experiment with 79 communication students, who were presented with three versions of the same fabricated scientific article: one without images, one with an institutional research image, and one with a stock image. The findings indicate that while stock images may reduce comprehension of technical content, they slightly enhance reader engagement. Our analysis calls for a more nuanced understanding of AI imagery, moving beyond ethical concerns to consider how these visuals shape public discourse. While stock images contribute to a standardized and sometimes misleading portrayal of AI, their rhetorical power in communication contexts should not be overlooked. The paper concludes by arguing for a more critical yet balanced approach to evaluating the role of images in AI representation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.",2025,,AI and Society,,,,,10.1007/s00146-025-02283-0,,#4632,Romele 2025,,,0
Designing for Healthy Food Practices: Challenges and Opportunities for Changing People’s Eating Behavior Using Persuasive Technology,"Rapp, A.; Boldi, A.","Food habits are widely acknowledged to have a major impact on health and well-being. However, changing them remains an incredibly challenging endeavor. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings of the project Promoting Healthy and Sustainable Eating through Interactive and Explainable AI Methods (PHaSE), which aims to support individuals in adopting healthier and more sustainable diets. We begin by reviewing previous efforts to design technology aimed at changing people’s food behavior. Through an analysis of 20 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) papers, we highlight that current technologies rarely support sense-making or consider the lived experience of behavior change. Instead, they often place significant emphasis on the target behavior to be modified. Next, we recount the findings from three design workshops, where participants identified several conversational design strategies that an agent should employ to effectively influence behavior. These include showing empathy and providing suggestions that are clear, trustworthy, and actionable. Additionally, the conversational agent should offer personalized advice that accounts for individual differences, while maintaining a friendly tone and avoiding a prescriptive approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2025,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,15793 LNCS,,280-297,,10.1007/978-3-031-93508-4_21,,#4633,Rapp 2025,,,0
Overcoming barriers and enabling artificial intelligence adoption in allied health clinical practice: A qualitative study,"Hoffman, J.; Wenke, R.; Angus, R.L.; Shinners, L.; Richards, B.; Hattingh, L.","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionise healthcare. If the implementation is successful it has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for patients and organisations. Little is known about the perceptions of allied health professionals (AHPs) towards AI in healthcare. Objective: This study investigated barriers and enablers to AI implementation in the delivery of healthcare from the AHPs perspective. Methods: Qualitative methodology informed by behaviour change theory using focus groups with AHPs at a health service in Queensland, Australia. Results: Twenty-four barriers and 24 enablers were identified by 25 participants across four focus groups. Barriers included: lack of AI knowledge, explainability challenges, risk to professional practice, negative impact on professional practice, and role replacement. Enablers include AI training and education, regulation, reputation, understanding the healthcare benefits of AI and engaging clinical champions. Conclusions: AHPs have concerns about the impact and trustworthiness of AI and the readiness of organisations to support its use. Organisations must take a proactive approach and adopt targeted and multifaceted strategies to address barriers. This may include workforce upskilling, clear communication of the benefits of AI use of local champions and ongoing research. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Digital Health,11,,,,10.1177/20552076241311144,,#4634,Hoffman 2025,,,0
From Innovation to Implementation: A Qualitative Study of New Zealand Mental Health Clinicians’ Views on Digital Tools,"Rawnsley, C.; Stasiak, K.","The objective was to explore New Zealand mental health clinicians’ and trainees’ knowledge, utilization, and attitudes towards digital mental health tools through semi-structured interviews. Participants were recruited from an online survey about digital mental health tools. At the survey’s conclusion, participants could express interest and provide contact details via a link. One-on-one in-depth Zoom interviews were conducted, lasting an average of 45 min each. Data collection occurred between August 2021 and February 2022. Anonymized transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Seventeen clinicians took part, and four primary themes emerged: (1) receptiveness to digital innovation, most had used digital mental health tools with clients, observing beneficial outcomes and positive responses; (2) digital technology remains a double-edged sword, offering significant supportive opportunities while also highlighting the digital divide; (3) impediments to clinical implementation, stemming from concerns about maintaining clinical safety and the need to adapt beyond established comfort zones; (4) aspirations for digital technology in clinical practice, encompassing innovative ideas, desire for tools responsive to New Zealand’s diverse communities, and ideas to maximize their potential. This qualitative study gives voice to New Zealand mental health practitioners and their interest in digital innovations to improve client care. However, integrating digital mental health tools into clinical practice effectively depends on overcoming challenges like the digital divide, data privacy, safety concerns, and the lack of tools that reflect New Zealand culture or offer personalization to meet individual needs. It highlights the need for collaboration in developing and deploying digital interventions that are both aligned with clinician requirements and adapted to the specific contexts of their client communities. This research provides a historical (albeit 3-year-old) account of clinician attitudes and knowledge. Given the rapid pace of technological innovation—particularly the rise of generative AI since late 2023—taking snapshots of changing attitudes becomes ever more important as the technological landscape continues to evolve. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Journal of Technology in Behavioral Science,,,,,10.1007/s41347-025-00497-z,,#4635,Rawnsley 2025,,,0

Chatbots for Sexual Health Improvement: A Systematic Review,"Fetrati, H.; Chan, G.; Orji, R.","There is a rising interest in chatbots dedicated to enhancing sexual health. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of these chatbots, and the current literature lacks sufficient exploration of gaps and patterns in this field. In this review, we provided an overview of the state-of-the-art research conducted on sexual health chatbots, with the goal of identifying prevalent trends, design patterns, and features. In addition, we investigated existing research gaps, challenges, and shortcomings in the landscape of sexual health chatbots. Further, we proposed potential enhancements and directions for future research and development to create more effective chatbots in this field. A systematic search and screening of the literature from the past decade (2013–2023), extracted from seven databases, yielded a total of 1040 studies, out of which 29 articles were included in the final review following screening. The findings suggest that chatbots are usable and effective tools in sexual health education, persuasion, and assistance that are appreciated for their confidentiality, efficiency, and 24/7 availability. However, their performance is hindered by limitations such as restricted scope of knowledge and challenges in understanding user inputs. Additionally, constraints such as text-only input/output modalities and a predominant reliance on the English language limit their accessibility and acceptability. There is also a crucial need for more research in low-income or lower-middle-income countries, where individuals require increased sexual health education and support. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2025,,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,41,4,1997-2019,,10.1080/10447318.2024.2376808,,#4637,Fetrati 2025,,,0
"User Experience of and Adherence to a Smartphone App to Maintain Behavior Change and Self-Management in Patients With Work-Related Skin Diseases: Multistep, Single-Arm Feasibility Study","Ristow, N.; Wilke, A.; Skudlik, C.; John, S.M.; Ludewig, M.","Background: Smartphone apps are a growing field supporting the prevention of chronic diseases. The user experience (UX) is an important predictor of app use and should be considered in mobile health research. Long-term skin protection behavior is important for those with work-related skin diseases. However, altering health behavior is complex and requires a high level of self-management. We developed a maintenance program consisting of the Mein Hautschutz im Alltag (MiA; “My skin protection in everyday life”) app combined with an individual face-to-face goal-setting interview to support patients in the implementation of skin protection behavior after inpatient rehabilitation. Objective: The objectives of this paper are to (1) describe the intervention in a standardized manner; (2) evaluate the UX, subjective quality, and perceived impact of the MiA app; and (3) evaluate the adherence to the MiA app. Methods: We followed a user-centered and multistage iterative process in 2 steps that combined qualitative and quantitative data. The maintenance program was tested over 12 weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. The UX, subjective quality, and perceived impact were evaluated formatively based on the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale after 12 weeks (T2). Adherence was measured using the frequency of interactions with the app. Results: In total, 42 patients took part (with a dropout rate of n=18, 43% at T2). The average age was 49.5 (SD 13.1) years, and 57% (24/42) were male. We found high ratings for the UX, with an average score of 80.18 (SD 8.94) out of a theoretical maximum of 100, but there were a few exceptions in the usability and interaction with the app. The app was most frequently rated with 4 out of 5 stars (15/24, 65%), which indicates a high subjective quality. Furthermore, the app seemed to influence important determinants to implement skin protection behavior. Adherence to skin protection tracking was higher over the study period than adherence to skin documentation and goal assessment. The number of adherent participants to skin protection tracking was higher in the skin care and skin cleansing categories (28/42, 67% each) compared to the skin protection category (13/42, 31%) on day 1 and decreased until day 84 in all dimensions (12/42, 29% each for skin care and skin cleansing; 9/42, 21% for skin protection). Conclusions: The results in terms of adherence met the expectations and were consistent with those of other studies evaluating the use of apps for chronic diseases. Interaction with the app could be increased using artificial intelligence to determine eczema severity via photos. It should be investigated which subgroups have difficulties with usability to individualize the support to a greater degree during onboarding. There is a need for further research regarding the effectiveness of the MiA app on skin protection behavior, quality of life, and eczema severity. ©Nele Ristow, Annika Wilke, Christoph Skudlik, Swen Malte John, Michaela Ludewig.",2025,,JMIR Formative Research,9,,,,10.2196/66791,,#4638,Ristow 2025,,,0
The Power of Customer Journey Mapping with Artificial Intelligence: A Case Study Method,"Gabelaia, I.; Djakeli, K.; McElroy, J.W.","Simply constructing a customer journey map is not enough. Customer preferences and behaviors change over time in response to emerging needs and circumstances. To ensure customer experiences are positive, companies must refresh customer journey maps. Hence, AI helps in precisely capturing customer interactions at various touchpoints, retaining up-to-date and relevant maps, and adjusting complex customer journeys. Customer journey mapping is an efficient technique that enables companies to visualize their customers’ end-to-end experiences. This research explored the impact of customer journey mapping with integrated artificial intelligence on companies to enhance customer experience and increase customer loyalty. Using AI-driven analytics, companies can effectively gather and analyze massive amounts of data from various touchpoints. Nevertheless, AI-powered customer journey mapping encourages predictive modeling, enabling companies to foresee customer behaviors.

Genuine or Fake? Explaining Consumers' Perception and Detection of AI-Generated Fake Reviews,"Fröhnel, K.; Santelmann, B.; Zarnekow, R.","The importance of online reviews for consumers' decision-making engages fraudsters to game the review system by writing or buying fake reviews. Fake reviews are a main threat to consumers since they are hardly distinguishable from genuine human-made reviews. Moreover, advances in generative AI like ChatGPT foster the simple creation of persuasive text, such as high-quality fake reviews. While prior studies primarily focused on automatic fake review detection, little is known about how consumers react to AI-generated fake reviews. Based on a quantitative-qualitative study with 151 consumers (906 review classifications), we found that humans cannot reliably distinguish between genuine and AI-generated fake reviews (accuracy= 53.2%). They are especially worse at detecting negative AI-generated fake reviews. Our findings extend prior research by examining consumers' ability to detect AI-generated fake reviews, identifying a set of cues they use for review classification, and investigating the cues' effectiveness for detection.

Exploring Older Adults’ Perspectives and Acceptance of AI-Driven Health Technologies: Qualitative Study,"Wong, A.K.C.; Lee, J.H.T.; Zhao, Y.; Lu, Q.; Yang, S.; Hui, V.C.C.","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied in various health care services due to its enhanced efficiency and accuracy. As the population ages, AI-based health technologies could be a potent tool in older adults’ health care to address growing, complex, and challenging health needs. This study aimed to investigate perspectives on and acceptability of the use of AI-led health technologies among older adults and the potential challenges that they face in adopting them. The findings from this inquiry could inform the designing of more acceptable and user-friendly AI-based health technologies. Objective: The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate the attitudes and perceptions of older adults toward the use of AI-based health technologies; (2) to identify potential facilitators, barriers, and challenges influencing older adults’ preferences toward AI-based health technologies; and (3) to inform strategies that can promote and facilitate the use of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design. A total of 27 community-dwelling older adults were recruited from a local community center. Three sessions of semistructured interviews were conducted, each lasting 1 hour. The sessions covered five key areas: (1) general impressions of AI-based health technologies; (2) previous experiences with AI-based health technologies; (3) perceptions and attitudes toward AI-based health technologies; (4) anticipated difficulties in using AI-based health technologies and underlying reasons; and (5) willingness, preferences, and motivations for accepting AI-based health technologies. Thematic analysis was applied for data analysis. The Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model behavior change wheel were integrated into the analysis. Identified theoretical domains were mapped directly to the COM-B model to determine corresponding strategies for enhancing the acceptability of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Results: The analysis identified 9 of the 14 Theoretical Domains Framework domains—knowledge, skills, social influences, environmental context and resources, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, intentions, goals, and emotion. These domains were mapped to 6 components of the COM-B model. While most participants acknowledged the potential benefits of AI-based health technologies, they emphasized the irreplaceable role of human expertise and interaction. Participants expressed concerns about the usability of AI technologies, highlighting the need for user-friendly and tailored AI solutions. Privacy concerns and the importance of robust security measures were also emphasized as critical factors affecting their willingness to adopt AI-based health technologies. Conclusions: Integrating AI as a supportive tool alongside health care providers, rather than regarding it as a replacement, was highlighted as a key strategy for promoting acceptance. Government support and clear guidelines are needed to promote ethical AI implementation in health care. These measures can improve health outcomes in the older adult population by encouraging the adoption of AI-driven health technologies. © Arkers Kwan Ching Wong, Jessica Hiu Toon Lee, Yue Zhao, Qi Lu, Shulan Yang, Vivian Chi Ching Hui.",2025,,JMIR Aging,8,,,,10.2196/66778,,#4642,Wong 2025,,,0

Pitfalls in Evaluating Inference-time Methods for Improving LLM Reliability,"Jerge, M.; Evans, D.","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but are still prone to outputting falsehoods using seemingly persuasive language. Many recent works attempt to address this problem by using LLMs in a framework where a single seed prompt results in a series of interactions involving augmented prompts with an otherwise unchanged LLM, and the results are aggregated with a goal of producing a more reliable output. We consider the replicability and generalizability of evaluations of inference-time methods intended to improve the reliability of responses from base LLMs. We survey how methods have been evaluated in the literature and find a great variety of benchmarks and models in use. Motivated by this, we conduct our own evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of a few methods across a range of benchmarks and models. We find that while these techniques show promise in improving reliability, there is still significant variability in performance across different domains and tasks, and methods that show substantial improvements on weaker base models often do not improve reliability for better base models. © 2025, Transactions on Machine Learning Research.

Evaluating the Performance of Open-Source LLMs in Local RAG Systems: A Practical Study on Low-Carbon Data Applications,"Chang, Y.-J.; Yu, T.-Y.; Chang, C.-H.","People often underestimate their carbon emissions, but once they become aware of the environmental impact of their actions, it can lead to significant behavioral changes. Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of improving low-carbon literacy, especially through personalized information, which is more effective in driving behavior change than generalized information. Chatbots can play a key role in delivering tailored messages, providing guidance on food choices, building materials, appliance use, transportation options (e.g., car sharing), and other behaviors that influence an individual’s carbon footprint. This study aims to develop a simple, scalable, and easily maintainable low-carbon activity database using open-source software, operating locally to reduce reliance on paid APIs. Implemented on the Ollama platform, the system can be deployed on consumer-grade computers with acceptable response times. By utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, the system converts data into a vector database and uses a large language model for retrieval. Carbon emission data from four sources were used, and the system’s retrieval performance was tested with 100 prompts in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese. The results showed that database size had the largest impact on recall rates, especially when irrelevant or similar data were included. Model selection was also critical, particularly in multilingual contexts where proper language settings played a significant role. The study found that chunk size had a minor influence on results, but the choice of language, while important, was less critical than database size. These findings underscore the need for careful database design and model selection, especially in multilingual RAG systems, and suggest further research to address challenges like scalability and adaptation to diverse data types. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.",2025,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,2487 CCIS,,55-66,,10.1007/978-981-96-6400-9_5,,#4646,Chang 2025,,,0

Exploring Personalized AI-Driven Literacy Programs for ESL Learners: Insights from Neuromarketing,"Svetleff, Z.","This paper proposes an innovative solution to address low literacy among adult English as a Second Language (ESL) learners by utilizing Generative AI within a personalized literacy platform. This AI-driven platform is designed to motivate and engage adult ESL learners through a multimodal, audio-visual tutoring system that tailors educational content to individual interests and learning needs. Grounded in theories of persuasive communication, neuroscience, and economics, our approach leverages established educational strategies, such as the science of reading and neuromarketing models, to enhance literacy development. The platform will implement the NeuroMap framework by Morin and Renvoisé (2018), integrating six persuasive stimuli proven to impact student motivation. These stimuli will be used to evaluate and select learning resources for initial inclusion, refining content based on their potential to engage students deeply. Our method includes eye-tracking to assess real-time engagement through perceptual “with-me-ness” measures, alongside a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based recommendation system to dynamically adjust content. Expected results include improved literacy rates among ESL learners, driven by personalized content that engages the primal brain, connects emotionally with users, and adapts in response to engagement and learning performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2025,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,15618 LNCS,,99-106,,10.1007/978-3-031-88220-3_6,,#4648,Svetleff 2025,,,0
Design and Baseline Evaluation of Social Media Vaping Prevention Trial: Randomized Controlled Trial Study,"Evans, W.D.; Ichimiya, M.; Bingenheimer, J.B.; Cantrell, J.; D'Esterre, A.P.; Pincus, O.; Yu, L.Q.; Hair, E.C.","Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is a major public health problem and young adults aged 18-24 years are at high risk. Furthermore, oral nicotine products (ONPs) are growing in popularity in this population. Poly-use is widespread. New methodologies for rigorous online studies using social media have been conducted and shown to reduce nicotine use. Objective: We report on the design and baseline evaluation of a large-scale social media-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of antivaping social media on young adult vaping and determinants of use. Methods: Using the Virtual Lab social media platform, participants were recruited using an artificial intelligence chatbot and social media advertising, completed a baseline survey, and were randomized to 1 of 4 study arms. The design was to achieve specific numbers of impressions per arm over 3 survey time points. We recruited 8437 participants, stratified by vaper (n=5026) and nonvaper (n=3321) status. Questionnaire data were collected using the Qualtrics survey platform. Future analyses will examine the effects of social media content on vaping at the endline. Our data analysis describes the 2 cohort samples, examines balance across the 4 study arms on baseline variables in each of the cohorts, and evaluates the internal consistency of several multi-indicator measures of psychosocial constructs. Results: Among vapers, almost three-fourths were current vapers, >40% were current smokers (using in the past 30 days), and >48% were current poly-users (using e-cigarettes and ≥1 other tobacco products). Substantial numbers of current vapers also currently use some other product, including cigars (n=1520, 30.2%), hookah (n=794, 15.8%), smokeless devices (n=462, 9.2%), and ONPs (n=578, 11.5%). The average age of participants was 21.2 (SD 2) years. Just less than 45% of participants were non-Hispanic White (n=3728, 44.7%), just less than 47% (n=3913, 46.9%) of the sample was male, more than 44% (n=3704, 44.4%) reported completing high school, and 79.3% reported meeting basic needs or better. There were no significant differences between arms and strata by any of these demographics. We calculated scale scores for depression and covariates related to nicotine use and found high alphas. Finally, participants who reported having seen antitobacco brand advertising were more likely to have higher levels of these variables and scales than participants who reported not having seen the advertisements. These results will be examined in future studies. Conclusions: Social media can be used as a platform at scale for longitudinal randomized controlled trials over extended periods, which extends previous research on short-term trials. Interventions delivered by social media can be used with large samples to evaluate social media health behavior change interventions. Future studies based on this research will evaluate the intervention and dose-response effects of social media exposure on vaping behavior and determinants. © William Douglas Evans, Megumi Ichimiya, Jeffrey B Bingenheimer, Jennifer Cantrell, Alexander P D'Esterre, Olivia Pincus, Linda Q Yu, Elizabeth C Hair.",2025,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,27,,,,10.2196/72002,,#4649,Evans 2025,,,0
Decoding Persuasiveness in Eloquence Competitions: An Investigation into the LLM’s Ability to Assess Public Speaking,"Barkar, A.; Chollet, M.; Labeau, M.; Biancardi, B.; Clavel, C.","The increasing importance of public speaking (PS) skills has fueled the development of automated assessment systems, yet the integration of large language models (LLMs) in this domain remains underexplored. This study investigates the application of LLMs for assessing PS by predicting persuasiveness. We propose a novel framework where LLMs evaluate criteria derived from educational literature and feedback from PS coaches, offering new interpretable textual features. We demonstrate that persuasiveness predictions of a regression model with the new features achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.6, underperforming approach with hand-crafted lexical features (RMSE 0.51) and outperforming direct zero-shot LLM persuasiveness predictions (RMSE of 0.8). Furthermore, we find that only LLM-evaluated criteria of language level is predictable from lexical features (F1-score of 0.56), disapproving relations between these features. Based on our findings, we criticise the abilities of LLMs to analyze PS accurately.

Digital Technologies as Enablers of the Circular Economy: An Empirical Perspective on the Role of Companies in Driving Customer Behaviour Change,"Bücker, C.; Pantel, J.; Geissdoerfer, M.; Bhattacharjya, J.; Kumar, M.","The circular economy concept has gained significant attention in the academic and industrial discourse. Yet, the widespread adoption of circular business models is still outstanding, with a lack of customer acceptance representing a critical barrier. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the potential of digital technologies to expedite the circular economy's broader implementation. This study investigates the role of digital technologies in enhancing customer acceptance of circular business models in consumer-facing industries. To extract insights from practice, we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews with experts from companies that have implemented circular economy principles, management consulting firms, and academia. As a result, we provide thematical structures of (1) 35 factors affecting customer acceptance of circular business models, (2) 36 practices that organizations can deploy to address these factors and enhance customer acceptance, and (3) 19 digital technologies to facilitate such practices. Our findings combine and extend insights from the distinct research streams of behavioral science and theory of digital technology management by adding a technology dimension to the behavior change wheel, highlighting the interplay between sources of behavior (factors), intervention functions (practices), and technological enablers (digital technologies). This extended framework will support researchers investigating the role of digital technologies and inform companies about the use of digital technologies in circular business model innovation as an enabler of customer acceptance. © 2025 The Author(s).

Can AI and AI-Hybrids Detect Persuasion Skills? Salesforce Hiring with Conversational Video Interviews,"Chakraborty, I.; Chiong, K.; Dover, H.; Sudhir, K.","We develop an AI and AI-human-based model for salesforce hiring using recordings of conversational video interviews that involve two-sided, back-and-forth interactions with messages conveyed through multiple modalities (text, voice, and body language). We derive objective, theory-backed measures of sales performance from these modalities, leveraging recent advances in body language analysis, conversational analysis, and large language models (LLMs). These measures serve as explanatory variables in our AI model. Our key contribution to the broader research on persuasion and influence is that we show how to use conversational videos to capture features related to (i) two-way conversational interactivity; (ii) real-time adaptation; and (iii) human body language, with minimal measurement error relative to extant survey-based approaches that suffer from recall biases. We use rubric-based scores by panels of sales professionals (correlated with hiring decisions) to isolate a candidate’s “latent sales ability” and use these as outcome variables to be predicted by the AI model. The AI model achieves reasonable predictive accuracy, yet incorporating human judgments into an AI-human hybrid model enhances its effectiveness—improving workforce quality by 67% over random selection. Although the content of what is spoken is most important in prediction, conversational interactivity, sellers’ real-time adaptation to the buyer, and body language also have good explanatory power. Finally, in terms of performance-cost trade-offs, the addition of just one human professional evaluation in the hiring loop in combination with AI is optimal. Further, using human input based on only the two early stages of the interview in a task-based hybrid model is the most cost-effective in improving performance. © 2024 INFORMS.",2025,,Marketing Science,44,1,30-53,,10.1287/mksc.2023.0149,,#4652,Chakraborty 2025,,,0
Behavior Change Support Systems for Self-Treating Procrastination: Systematic Search in App Stores and Analysis of Motivational Design Archetypes,"Kirchner-Krath, J.; Schmidt-Kraepelin, M.; Schmähl, K.; Schütz, C.; Morschheuser, B.; Sunyaev, A.","Background: The phenomenon of procrastination refers to an individual’s conscious decision to postpone the completion of tasks despite being aware of its adverse consequences in the future. Extant research in this field shows that procrastination is associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress and the likelihood of developing depression and calls for the development of suitable interventions that support individuals in making lasting positive changes to their procrastination behaviors. In parallel, practice has produced a plethora of behavior change support systems (BCSSs) that aim to provide a low-threshold, accessible alternative to in-person therapeutic approaches. Most of these BCSSs can be considered motivational BCSSs that combine functional, utilitarian components with hedonic and eudaimonic design elements to empower self-treatment. Although early studies have suggested the potential benefits of such BCSSs, research on understanding their specific design characteristics and support of individuals in self-treating procrastination is still in its infancy. Objective: In response to this gap between practice and research, we aimed to analyze and systemize the multitude of practical design efforts in motivational BCSSs for the self-treatment of procrastination and identify the main design archetypes that have emerged. Methods: We conducted a 3-step research approach. First, we identified 127 behavior change support apps for procrastination through a systematic screening process in the German and US Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Second, we systematically coded the identified apps in terms of the behavior change techniques targeted by their functional design and hedonic or eudaimonic design elements. Third, we conducted a 2-step cluster analysis to identify archetypes of motivational design in behavior change support apps to combat procrastination. Results: A variety of motivational designs have been developed and implemented in practice, and our analysis identified five main archetypes: (1) structured progress monitor, (2) self-improvement guide, (3) productivity adventure, (4) emotional wellness coach, and (5) social focus companion. The identified archetypes target different psychological determinants of procrastination and successfully use a variety of hedonic and eudaimonic design elements that extend beyond the current state of research. Conclusions: The results of our study provide a foundation for future research endeavors that aim to examine the comparative effects of motivational design archetypes and develop more effective interventions tailored to individual needs. For practitioners, the findings reveal the contemporary design space of motivational BCSSs to support the self-treatment of procrastination and may serve as blueprints that can guide the design of future systems. For individuals seeking support and health professionals treating procrastination, our study systemizes the landscape of apps, thereby facilitating the selection of one that best aligns with the patient’s individual needs. ©Jeanine Kirchner-Krath, Manuel Schmidt-Kraepelin, Katharina Schmähl, Christoph Schütz, Benedikt Morschheuser, Ali Sunyaev.",2025,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,27,,,,10.2196/65214,,#4653,Kirchner-Krath 2025,,,0
Enhancing Infection Control in ICUS Through AI: A Literature Review,"Godbole, A.A.; Mehra, M.; Banerjee, S.; Roy, P.; Deb, N.; Jagtap, S.","Introduction: Infection control in intensive care units (ICUs) is crucial due to the high risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs), which can increase patient morbidity, mortality, and costs. Effective measures such as hand hygiene, use of personal protective equipment (PPE), patient isolation, and environmental cleaning are vital to minimize these risks. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) offers new opportunities to enhance infection control, from predicting outbreaks to optimizing antimicrobial use, ultimately improving patient safety and care in ICUs. Objectives: The primary objectives are to explore AI's impact on predicting HAIs, real-time monitoring, automated sterilization, resource optimization, and personalized infection control plans. Methodology: A comprehensive search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted for relevant articles up to January 2024, including case series, reports, and cohort studies. Animal studies and irrelevant articles were excluded, with a focus on those considered to have significant clinical relevance. Discussion: The review highlights AI's prowess in predicting HAIs, surpassing conventional methods. Existing evidence demonstrates AI's efficacy in accurately predicting and mitigating HAIs. Real-time patient monitoring and alert systems powered by AI are shown to enhance infection detection and patient outcomes. The paper also addresses AI's role in automating sterilization and disinfection, with studies affirming its effectiveness in reducing infections. AI's resource optimization capabilities are exemplified in ICU settings, showcasing its potential to improve resource allocation efficiency. Furthermore, the review emphasizes AI's personalized approach to infection control post-procedures, elucidating its ability to analyze patient data and create tailored control plans. © 2025 The Author(s).

Chatbot -assisted self-assessment (CASA): Co-designing an AI -powered behaviour change intervention for ethnic minorities,"Nadarzynski, T.; Knights, N.; Husbands, D.; Graham, C.; Llewellyn, C.D.; Buchanan, T.; Montgomery, I.; Rodriguez, A.S.; Ogueri, C.; Singh, N.; Rouse, E.; Oyebode, O.; Das, A.; Paydon, G.; Lall, G.; Bulukungu, A.; Yanyali, N.; Stefan, A.; Ridge, D.","Background The digitalisation of healthcare has provided new ways to address disparities in sexual health outcomes that particularly affect ethnic and sexual minorities. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can provide personalised health education and refer users for appropriate medical consultations. We aimed to explore design principles of a chatbot-assisted culturally sensitive self-assessment intervention based on the disclosure of health-related information. Methods In 2022, an online survey was conducted among an ethnically diverse UK sample (N = 1,287) to identify the level and type of health-related information disclosure to sexual health chatbots, and reactions to chatbots’ risk appraisal. Follow-up interviews (N = 41) further explored perceptions of chatbot-led health assessment to identify aspects related to acceptability and utilisation. Datasets were analysed using one-way ANOVAs, linear regression, and thematic analysis. Results Participants had neutral-to-positive attitudes towards chatbots and were comfortable disclosing demographic and sensitive health information. Chatbot awareness, previous experience and positive attitudes towards chatbots predicted information disclosure. Qualitatively, four main themes were identified: “Chatbot as an artificial health advisor”, “Disclosing information to a chatbot”, “Ways to facilitate trust and disclosure”, and “Acting on self-assessment”. Conclusion Chatbots were acceptable for health self-assessment among this sample of ethnically diverse individuals. Most users reported being comfortable disclosing sensitive and personal information, but user anonymity is key to engagement with chatbots. As this technology becomes more advanced and widely available, chatbots could potentially become supplementary tools for health education and screening eligibility assessment. Future research is needed to establish their impact on screening uptake and access to health services among minoritised communities. © 2025 Nadarzynski et al.

"Data in Personalized Nutrition: Bridging Biomedical, Psycho-behavioral, and Food Environment Approaches for Population-wide Impact","Linseisen, J.; Renner, B.; Gedrich, K.; Wirsam, J.; Holzapfel, C.; Lorkowski, S.; Watzl, B.; Daniel, H.; Leitzmann, M.","Personalized nutrition (PN) represents an approach aimed at delivering tailored dietary recommendations, products, or services to support both prevention and treatment of nutrition-related conditions and to improve individual health using genetic, phenotypic, medical, nutritional, and other pertinent information. However, current approaches have yielded limited scientific success in improving diets or in mitigating diet-related conditions. In addition, PN currently caters to a specific subgroup of the population rather than having a widespread impact on diet and health at a population level. Addressing these challenges requires integrating traditional biomedical and dietary assessment methods with psycho-behavioral, and novel digital and diagnostic methods for comprehensive data collection, which holds considerable promise in alleviating present PN shortcomings. This comprehensive approach not only allows for deriving personalized goals (“what should be achieved”) but also customizing behavioral change processes (“how to bring about change”). We herein outline and discuss the concept of “Adaptive Personalized Nutrition Advice Systems,” which blends data from 3 assessment domains: 1) biomedical/health phenotyping; 2) stable and dynamic behavioral signatures; and 3) food environment data. Personalized goals and behavior change processes are envisaged to no longer be based solely on static data but will adapt dynamically in-time and in-situ based on individual-specific data. To successfully integrate biomedical, behavioral, and environmental data for personalized dietary guidance, advanced digital tools (e.g., sensors) and artificial intelligence-based methods will be essential. In conclusion, the integration of both established and novel static and dynamic assessment paradigms holds great potential for transitioning PN from its current focus on elite nutrition to a widely accessible tool that delivers meaningful health benefits to the general population. © 2025 The Authors",2025,,Advances in Nutrition,,,,,10.1016/j.advnut.2025.100377,,#4657,Linseisen 2025,,,0

Identifying Key Principles and Commonalities in Digital Serious Game Design Frameworks: Scoping Review,"Maxim, R.I.; Arnedo-Moreno, J.","Background: Digital serious games (DSGs), designed for purposes beyond entertainment and consumed via electronic devices, have garnered attention for their potential to enhance learning and promote behavior change. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of their design. Frameworks for DSG design can guide the creation of engaging games tailored to objectives such as education, health, and social impact. Objective: This study aims to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature on digital entertainment game design frameworks and DSG design frameworks (DSGDFWs). The focus is on conceptual frameworks offering high-level guidance for the game creation process rather than component-specific tools. We explore how these frameworks can be applied to create impactful serious games in fields such as health care and education. Key goals include identifying design principles, commonalities, dependencies, gaps, and opportunities in the literature. Suggestions for future research include empathic design thinking, artificial intelligence integration, and iterative improvements. The findings culminate in a synthesized 4-phase design process, offering generic guidelines for designers and developers to create effective serious games that benefit society. Methods: A 2-phase methodology was used: a scoping literature review and cluster analysis. A targeted search across 7 databases (ACM, Scopus, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, JMIR Publications, and SAGE) was conducted using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Studies included academic or industry papers evaluating digital game design frameworks. Cluster analysis was applied to categorize the data, revealing trends and correlations among frameworks. Results: Of 987 papers initially identified, 25 (2.5%) met the inclusion criteria, with an additional 22 identified through snowballing, resulting in 47 papers. These papers presented 47 frameworks, including 16 (34%) digital entertainment game design frameworks and 31 (66%) DSGDFWs. Thematic analysis grouped frameworks into categories, identifying patterns and relationships between design elements. Commonalities, dependencies, and gaps were analyzed, highlighting opportunities for empathic design thinking and artificial intelligence applications. Key considerations in DSG design were identified and presented in a 4-phase design baseline with the outcome of a list of design guidelines that might, according to the literature, be applied to an end-to-end process of designing and building future innovative solutions. Conclusions: The main benefits of using DSGDFWs seem to be related to enhancing the effectiveness of serious games in achieving their intended objectives, such as learning, behavior change, and social impact. Limitations primarily seem to be related to constraints associated with the specific contexts in which the serious games are developed and used. Approaches in the future should be aimed at refining and adapting existing frameworks to different contexts and purposes, as well as exploring new frameworks that incorporate emerging technologies and design principles. ©Raluca Ionela Maxim, Joan Arnedo-Moreno.",2025,,JMIR Serious Games,13,,,,10.2196/54075,,#4660,Maxim 2025,,,0

Mitigating Misleadingness in LLM-Generated Natural Language Explanations for Recommender Systems: Ensuring Broad Truthfulness Through Factuality and Faithfulness,"Maes, U.; Michiels, L.; Smets, A.","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural language explanations in recommender systems, offering the potential for adaptive, personalized, and interactive communication. However, their ability to produce plausible yet inaccurate justifications poses a risk of misleading users at scale. This paper examines the risk of misleading LLM-generated explanations, focusing on the interplay between truthfulness and persuasiveness. We propose a clear terminology for categorizing misleading explanations, differentiating between factual errors and unfaithful representations of the system's workings. Drawing on research from machine learning, human-computer interaction, and persuasive communication, we identify key challenges in evaluating and mitigating misleading explanations. We outline directions for future research, including the development of robust evaluation metrics and methods for enhancing the factuality and faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in recommender systems. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

"Rationally Trust, but Emotionally? The Roles of Cognitive and Affective Trust in Laypeople's Acceptance of AI for Preventive Care Operations","Kyung, N.; Kwon, H.E.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI‐based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new‐age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided. © The Author(s) 2024.",2025,,Production and Operations Management,,,,,10.1177/10591478231225891,,#4666,Kyung 2025,,,0
The Weaponization of Critical Thinking: Understanding the Dynamics of Human Memory,"Thomson, R.","With the proliferation of mis- and disinformation in media, hallucinating large-language model output integrated into our software and devices, and the sheer volume of information and opinion available online, it is essential that we leverage critical thinking strategies to counter the various narratives and targeted messages ubiquitous in modern Western society. The present paper argues that many critical thinking strategies are based on behavioral theories with limited justification at the cognitive and neural level. These theories exhibit false dichotomies which are convenient and persuasive in their simplicity, but may in fact lead to vulnerabilities when used as a basis for critical thinking. We argue that critical thinking strategies need to be understood in cognitive terms, and extant behavioral theories re-examined and re-interpreted to understand how memory formation, elaboration, and recall impacts decision-making. To accomplish this, we will proceed as follows: 1) we will provide an overview of decision-making research and address some concerns with popular dual-process accounts; 2) we will provide a cognitively-grounded explanation of decision-making and how integrating information about source credibility may be counterproductive, 3) we will provide evidence from cognitive models how certain kinds of critical thinking strategies may be exploitable, an 4) we will make recommendations for critical thinking education including the necessary role of adaptive instructional systems to independently assess various critical thinking processes involved in sense-making. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.",2025,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,15812 LNCS,,264-283,,10.1007/978-3-031-92967-0_19,,#4667,Thomson 2025,,,0
To Tell or Not to Tell: Investigating the Persuasive Appeal of Information Transparency for AR-Powered E-Commerce Sites,"Sun, Y.; Freeman, J.; Shoenberger, H.; Shen, F.","In e-commerce, Augmented Reality (AR) employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance the shopping experience through personalized recommendations based on users’ physical data. However, concerns regarding privacy and perceived intrusiveness can undermine the persuasive appeal of personalized AR for e-commerce experiences. Can overtly communicating information transparency mitigate such concerns? Two between-subjects online experiments were conducted, revealing that consumers were drawn to the AR-powered e-commerce site due to its heightened perceived immersion and usefulness but also considered it more intrusive than the non-AR site. However, when both websites were AR-powered, the one with high information transparency significantly enhanced perceived privacy protection, reducing perceived intrusiveness. Perceived transparency positively mediated the effects, particularly among individuals with lower pre-existing trust in algorithms. These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of AR in strategic communications and the design of information transparency for AR-powered e-commerce. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2025,,International Journal of Human-Computer Interaction,,,,,10.1080/10447318.2025.2495847,,#4668,Sun 2025,,,0

Does artificial intelligence redefine election campaigns and their democratic effects?,"Rubio, R.","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in election campaigns is significantly transforming the political and democratic landscape. AI has introduced new dynamics into electoral processes, impacting the way campaigns are conducted, which can pose a threat to the integrity of democratic systems. Technological innovations affect the way election campaigns are managed and executed. From traditional media such as radio, television and film, to digital platforms, technological evolution has enabled greater personalization and effectiveness in political communication. AI facilitates the analysis of large volumes of data, enabling highly segmented and personalized campaigns. At the same time, technological threats are a growing concern for democracy. Data manipulation, false profiling and cyber-attacks are some of the risks faced by electoral processes. These practices can affect the transparency and fairness of elections, compromising basic principles such as the freedom to vote. Digitalization amplifies both information and disinformation. Political propaganda has become more sophisticated, using AI techniques to create and disseminate disinformative content more effectively. This phenomenon contributes to the fragmentation and polarization of public opinion and can erode trust in the democratic process and institutions. AI is used to improve the persuasiveness and determent of political parties and candidates. It allows the creation of more sophisticated communication strategies and the optimization of electoral resources. However, it also poses ethical and practical challenges, such as manipulation of reality through deepfakes and extreme segmentation of the electorate. Responses to the challenges posed by AI in the electoral field have been diverse. Some technology platforms have adopted self-regulatory measures, such as tagging AI-generated content. However, self-regulation has proved to be insufficient, and a more robust legislative response is required to protect the integrity of electoral processes. In some countries, laws prohibiting the use of deepfakes in election campaigns have already been implemented. AI offers both opportunities and risks, and its impact on democracy depends on how its applications are managed and its negative effects mitigated. It is crucial to establish clear national and international regulatory framework covering the use of AI in electoral campaigns. This framework must ensure transparency, fairness and protection of electoral rights. Collaboration between governments, electoral institutions, technology companies and civil society is essential to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of democratic processes in the digital era. © 2025 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED).

Can LLMs Clarify? Investigation and Enhancement of Large Language Models on Argument Claim Optimization,"Wang, Y.; He, B.; Chen, X.; Sun, L.","In argumentation, the claim is the foundational proposition that underpins the argument, serving as the central pillar upon which the argument is constructed. It guides the subsequent presentation of evidence, reasoning, and analysis, thereby facilitating the audience's understanding of the core issue. Therefore, ensuring that the claim is precise and unambiguous is crucial for constructing a coherent and persuasive argument. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in text rewriting tasks such as style transfer and query rewriting, their application to claim optimization remains unexplored. Unlike other rewriting tasks, claim clarification requires the model to rewrite ambiguous or unclear segments of the claim, enhance the content by adding omitted key details, and eliminate redundant or verbose elements. Addressing this gap, this paper evaluates the performance of LLMs on the claim clarification task across various settings. While popular rewriting evaluation methods such as BLEU and ROUGE rely on exact word matching, this paper introduces a novel semantic evaluation approach based on a sliding window mechanism. Three distinct LLMs, including LLama2, Mistral, and Qwen2, are assessed for their ability to clarify arguments through zero-shot or few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we propose a reinforcement learning-based clarification approach that optimally balances content preservation with claim clarity, thereby augmenting the performance of LLMs on the claim clarification task. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2025,,"Proceedings - International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING",Part F206484-1,,4066-4077,,,,#4672,Wang 2025,,,0
Responsible design of an AI system for health behavior change—an ethics perspective on the participatory design process of the STAR-C digital coach,"Lindgren, H.; Lindvall, K.; Richter-Sundberg, L.","Introduction: The increased focus on the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) follows the increased use in society of data-driven analyses of personal information collected in the use of digital applications for various purposes that the individual is often not aware of. The purpose of this study is to investigate how values and norms are transformed into design choices in a participatory design process of an AI-based digital coaching application for promoting health and to prevent cardiovascular diseases, where a variety of expertise and perspectives are represented. Method: A participatory design process was conducted engaging domain professionals and potential users in co-design workshops, interviews and observations of prototype use. The design process and outcome was analyzed from a responsible design of AI systems perspective. Results: The results include deepened understanding of the values and norms underlying health coaching applications and how an AI-based intervention could provide person-tailored support in managing conflicting norms. Further, the study contributes to increased awareness of the value of participatory design in achieving value-based design of AI systems aimed at promoting health through behavior change, and the inclusion of social norms as a design material in the process. Conclusion: It was concluded that the relationship between the anticipated future users and the organization(s) or enterprises developing and implementing the health-promoting application is directing which values are manifested in the application. 2025 Lindgren, Lindvall and Richter-Sundberg.",2025,,Frontiers in Digital Health,7,,,,10.3389/fdgth.2025.1436347,,#4673,Lindgren 2025,,,0
Disruption in the human microbiome causing behavioural changes in bipolar disorder,"Srinivasan, S.","This chapter explores the intriguing and complex relationship between the human microbiome and Bipolar Disorder (BD). The microbiome, notably the gut microbiota, has been increasingly recognised as a key performer in brain health and disease. This is due to its role in the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Disruptions in the gut microbiota due to factors such as diet, and stress, may influence this axis and potentially trigger or exacerbate psychiatric conditions. Hence, we investigate into the present interpretation of the microbiome's role in mental health, concentrating on its impact on mood regulation and cognitive function. Consequently, we also explore the possible mechanisms through which microbiome disruption may pay to the behavioural changes observed in BD. Further exploration understand the complex interplay between the microbiome and BD and translate these findings into effective therapeutic plans. © 2025",2025,,International Review of Neurobiology,180,,157-187,,10.1016/bs.irn.2025.04.001,,#4676,Srinivasan 2025,,,0
Health recommender systems to facilitate collaborative decision-making in chronic disease management: A scoping review,"Barbaric, A.; Christofferson, K.; Benseler, S.M.; Lalloo, C.; Mariakakis, A.; Pham, Q.; Swart, J.F.; Yeung, R.S.M.; Cafazzo, J.A.","Objective: Health recommender systems (HRSs) are increasingly used to complement existing clinical decision-making processes, but their use for chronic diseases remains underexplored. Recognizing the importance of collaborative decision making (CDM) and patient engagement in chronic disease treatment, this review explored how HRSs support patients in managing their illness. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, advanced by Levac et al., in line with the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Quantitative (descriptive numerical summary) and qualitative (inductive content analysis) methods wered used to synthesize the data. Results: Forty-five articles were included in the final review, most commonly covering diabetes (9/45, 20%), mental health (9/45, 20.0%), and tobacco dependence (7/45, 15.6%). Behavior change theories (10/45, 22.2%) and authoritative sources (10/45, 22.2%) were the most commonly referenced sources for design and development work. From the thematic analysis, we conclude: (a) the main goal of HRSs is to induce behavior change, but limited research investigates their effectiveness in achieving this aim; (b) studies acknowledge that theories, models, frameworks, and/or guidelines help design HRSs to elicit specific behavior change, but they do not implement them; (c) connections between CDM and HRS purpose should be more explicit; and (d) HRSs can often offer other self-management services, such as progress tracking and chatbots. Conclusions: We recommend a greater emphasis on evaluation outcomes beyond algorithmic performance to determine HRS effectiveness and the creation of an evidence-driven, methodological approach to creating HRSs to optimize their use in enhancing patient care. Lay summary: Our work aims to provide a summary of the current landscape of health recommender system (HRS) use for chronic disease management. HRSs are digital tools designed to help people manage their health by providing personalized recommendations based on their health history, behaviors, and preferences, enabling them to make more informed health decisions. Given the increased use of these tools for personalized care, and especially with advancements in generative artificial intelligence, understanding the current methods and evaluation processes used is integral to optimizing their effectiveness. Our findings show that HRSs are most used for diabetes, mental health, and tobacco dependence, but only a small percentage of publications directly reference and/or use relevant frameworks to help guide their design and evaluation processes. Furthermore, the goal for most of these HRSs is to induce behavior change, but there is limited research investigating how effective they are in accomplishing this. Given these findings, we recommend that evaluations shift their focus from algorithms to more holistic approaches and to be more intentional about the processes used when designing the tool to support an evidence-driven approach and ultimately create more effective and useful HRSs for chronic disease management. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Digital Health,11,,,,10.1177/20552076241309386,,#4677,Barbaric 2025,,,0

Co-design of a digital 24-hour time-use intervention with older adults and allied health professionals,"Blake, H.T.; Davis, A.; Mellow, M.L.; Hull, M.; Robins, B.; Laver, K.; Dumuid, D.; Olds, T.; Keage, H.A.D.; Di Venuto, L.; Smith, A.E.","Using co-design principles based on the Health CASCADE framework, we aimed to describe the collaborative process undertaken to develop a 24-hour time-use intervention, called Small Steps, which promoted gradual and incremental health-behavior change. A secondary aim was to reflect on the challenges and benefits of co-design in this project, offering insights into the “why” and “how” to co-design 24-hour time-use interventions with priority populations. Twelve participants were invited and participated in 6 co-design workshops (June 2023–January 2024). To prioritize older adults’ views in the end-product, 8 adults aged >65 years (the target population) and 4 allied health professionals with >2 years’ experience working with the target population were recruited. Workshops and activities were structured using the British Design Council's Double Diamond Design Process to stimulate design thinking. Where possible, participant-led documentation was used to reduce the bias associated with academic scribing and empower participants to provide input and facilitate ownership for the project. Workshop activities and discussions were captured through printouts, audio and iPad screen recordings and analyzed through reflexive thematic and content analysis. Co-designers contributed to all elements of the intervention including the website design, the content, and the level of researcher input during the intervention. Iterative improvements were made based on the unique perspectives and needs of the community experts. During the action planning process, older adults wanted both support and autonomy, while maintaining the freedom to adapt these options to their individual needs. Older adults also preferred a step-by-step approach, allowing for gradual behavior changes across the intervention to avoid feelings of becoming overwhelmed. The co-design process enabled the tailoring of the Small Steps intervention to the specific needs of its intended audience. Key factors contributing to the co-design included flexibility in the design process, fostering a supportive environment, and empowering participants through activities that guided and stimulated their thinking. These elements not only helped shape the development of Small Steps but reinforced the value of co-design in developing personalised interventions for older adults. 2025 Blake, Davis, Mellow, Hull, Robins, Laver, Dumuid, Olds, Keage, Di Venuto and Smith.",2025,,Frontiers in Digital Health,7,,,,10.3389/fdgth.2025.1544489,,#4679,Blake 2025,,,0
Discernibility in explanations: Designing more acceptable and meaningful machine learning models for medicine,"Wang, H.; Aligon, J.; May, J.; Doumard, E.; Labroche, N.; Delpierre, C.; Soulé-Dupuy, C.; Casteilla, L.; Planat-Benard, V.; Monsarrat, P.","Although the benefits of machine learning are undeniable in healthcare, explainability plays a vital role in improving transparency and understanding the most decisive and persuasive variables for prediction. The challenge is to identify explanations that make sense to the biomedical expert. This work proposes discernibility as a new approach to faithfully reflect human cognition, based on the user's perception of a relationship between explanations and data for a given variable. A total of 50 participants (19 biomedical experts and 31 data scientists) evaluated their perception of the discernibility of explanations from both synthetic and human-based datasets (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The low inter-rater reliability of discernibility (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient < 0.5), with no significant difference between areas of expertise or levels of education, highlights the need for an objective metric of discernibility. Thirteen statistical coefficients were evaluated for their ability to capture, for a given variable, the relationship between its values and its explanations using Passing-Bablok regression. Among these, dcor was shown to be a reliable metric for assessing the discernibility of explanations, effectively capturing the clarity of the relationship between the data and their explanations, and providing clues to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms not immediately apparent when examining individual predictors. Discernibility can also serve as an evaluation metric for model quality, helping to prevent overfitting and aiding in feature selection, ultimately providing medical practitioners with more accurate and persuasive results. © 2025 The Authors",2025,,Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal,27,,1800-1808,,10.1016/j.csbj.2025.04.021,,#4680,Wang 2025,,,0
"Understanding the active ingredients, barriers, and facilitators to implement brief psychological interventions for substance misuse in Indian prisons: A qualitative study","Ghosh, A.; Pillai, R.R.; Vij, J.; Maulik, P.K.; George, B.B.; Basu, D.","Background: Substance misuse is prevalent in criminal justice populations. Addressing it in the criminal justice system (CJS) is vital for improving public health and reducing crime. Aim: This study explores the mechanisms, barriers, and facilitators of a brief psychosocial intervention for reducing substance misuse among inmates in a North Indian prison. Methods: A multidisciplinary team evaluated qualitatively using the Framework Method, guided by the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework. Participants were purposively selected from those enrolled in a clinical trial and included inmates aged 18–60 who completed three sessions of the intervention. Data were collected through in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) between November and December 2023. Thematic analysis identified key themes related to behavior change, implementation barriers, and facilitators. Results: The study identified ten main themes encompassing facilitators and barriers to behavior change. Key facilitators included peer influence, supportive relationships, intervention strategies, and self‑reflection. Major barriers were access to drugs, prison dynamics, psychological stressors, stigmatization, and withdrawal symptoms. The BCW framework highlighted the importance of addressing both individual and contextual factors, such as capability, opportunity, and motivation, to support behavior change. The intervention’s emphasis on stress management, acceptance, and building supportive peer networks was critical for its success. Conclusion: Individual interventions must be supplemented by systemic and structural changes to address prison‑specific challenges. Comprehensive staff training, integrated treatment models, peer support systems, and policy advocacy are recommended to enhance the effectiveness and scalability of psychosocial interventions in the CJS. © 2025 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",2025,,Indian Journal of Psychiatry,67,2,236-244,,10.4103/indianjpsychiatry.indianjpsychiatry_634_24,,#4681,Ghosh 2025,,,0

Benchmarking VLMs' Reasoning About Persuasive Atypical Images,"Malakouti, S.; Aghazadeh, A.; Khandelwal, A.; Kovashka, A.","Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong zero-shot generalization across various tasks, especially when integrated with large language models (LLMs). However, their ability to comprehend rhetorical and persuasive visual media, such as advertisements, remains understudied. Ads often employ atypical imagery, using surprising object juxtapositions to convey shared properties. For example, Fig. 1(e) shows a beer with a feather-like texture. This requires advanced reasoning to deduce that this atypical representation signifies the beer's lightness. We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality Classification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Atypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive images. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and test their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives. Finally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive image descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Findings reveal that: (1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple, effective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to comprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive ad understanding.

Artificial intelligence adoption for pharmaceutical salesforce performance: a case study in Kuwait,"Abdallah, W.; Aziza, M.; Chamas, H.B.","Purpose: The research aims to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmaceutical industry companies, specifically focusing on its impact on salesforce performance. Design/methodology/approach: We collected research data from pharmaceutical industry companies, specifically the salesforce teams, using a valid and reliable questionnaire. Descriptive data analysis was used to summarize the participants’ demographic characteristics, and inferential data analysis employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement model and the relationships between variables. Findings: About 176 questionnaires were completed, and only 169 were deemed complete and used for data analysis. This study reveals a significant relationship between pharmaceutical salesforce performance and AI adoption (a path coefficient of 0.647, a p-value of 0.000 and an R2 of 0.584). Supervisory support and career development emerged as the essential variables of pharmaceutical salesforce performance, with the strongest relationship to AI adoption, as indicated by a path coefficient of 0.434 and a p-value of 0.000. Practical implications: Based on the results of this study, supervisory support drives AI adoption, underscoring the importance of leaders during technological transformations. Supervisors help minimize employees’ opposition to change by providing concise direction, training and persuasion. By providing clear guidance, training and persuasion, supervisors decrease employee resistance to change.

Is Technology Adoption More Than Just Utility? the Role of Social Bonding and Motivation in UTAUT,"Federspiel, E.; Däullary, L.; Müller, S.; Loch, F.","Research suggests that social relationships and situational motivation drive change in behavior. Digital interaction technologies increasingly integrate customizable avatars and conversational chatbots to enhance long-term adoption. This development has prompted a critical examination of how affective attachment to digital systems influences technology acceptance. Traditional models (e.g., UTAUT2) focus on perceived usefulness and ease of use. In this paper, we extend the UTAUT2 framework by incorporating techno-social bonding and situational motivation as pivotal constructs to shape system adoption. Our model posits that personalization options, such as avatar customization and conversational agent interaction, foster techno-social bonding, a form of digital attachment that enhances perceived social presence and user satisfaction. In addition, we explore how situational motivation, particularly intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors, moderates the relationship between personalization characteristics and system acceptance. The application case of this paper is a Continuous Improvement (CI) system for production environments. We propose a four-week microrandomized trial. Participants will interact with the CI system under varying conditions, including chatbot-based versus form-based interactions and fixed versus personalized avatars. Key outcomes, including techno-social bonding and situational motivation, will be assessed with conventional technology acceptance constructs. This paper improves existing technology acceptance models by including techno-social bonding. This provides a deeper understanding of longterm system adoption and practical guidance for designing CI systems. Furthermore, the proposed model contributes to the development of Behavior Change Support Systems (BCSS) by integrating motivational and affective mechanisms that promote sustainable behavior change.  © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2025,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3965,,97-111,,,,#4689,Federspiel 2025,,,0

SynthClassify: An LLM-Driven Framework for Generating and Classifying Persuasive Text,"Panasyuk, A.","Automated detection of persuasion techniques is crucial for combating disinformation, but is hindered by the lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets, especially for less common techniques. This paper introduces SynthClassify, a novel framework and several large-scale synthetic datasets for advancing research in this area. SynthClassify uses a cyclic process: a GPT-4 based generator creates text designed to promote or minimize specific institutions using one of 23 persuasion techniques, and an ensemble of GPT-4 classifiers assesses the text's alignment with the intended technique. This iterative process, guided by a confidence threshold, achieves high-quality synthetic data without expensive manual annotation. The resulting dataset contains 634K instances across 19 countries and nearly 10K institutions. The dataset has been translated into six additional languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish), enabling cross-lingual research.

The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Communication Dynamics and Performance in Organizational Leadership,"Florea, N.V.; Croitoru, G.","This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies on leadership-based organizational communication and employee performance within contemporary workplaces. While prior research has acknowledged AI’s potential in optimizing communication processes, significant gaps remain in understanding its specific influence on core communication dimensions and organizational outcomes. This study addresses these gaps by examining six key communication elements—informing, message reception, feedback, acceptance, persuasion, and reaction—to assess whether AI technologies significantly enhance employee performance by improving internal communication efficiency and reducing transmission errors, which are crucial for productive interactions. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire from 203 employees of a major Romanian food industry company operating globally, including leaders and employees from three Eastern European countries. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the relationships between communication dimensions and performance. The findings revealed that informing, receiving, and accepting messages, along with reaction-provoking, had strong positive effects on performance, while feedback and persuasion showed moderate impacts. These results emphasize the transformative role of AI in communication processes, optimizing message flow and positively influencing employee behavior, thereby enhancing productivity and organizational efficiency. This research contributes to the growing body of literature by situating AI-driven communication within the broader organizational context, offering actionable insights for managers aiming to integrate AI ethically and effectively. Additionally, it offers a set of recommendations for employees and managers to lead communication process according to the new actual era of digitization, which is offering real benefits for both parts. It also provides a robust foundation for future research, encouraging longitudinal and cross-cultural studies to further investigate AI’s implications for organizational diversity, innovation, and employee well-being. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,,Administrative Sciences,15,2,,,10.3390/admsci15020033,,#4692,Florea 2025,,,0
Impact of the KARAZ platform's behavioral interventions and incentives on diabetic glycemic control in Saudi Arabia,"Alqutub, S.T.; Aljehani, F.","Introduction: The glucose management indicator (GMI) and time-in-range (TIR) are important glycemic parameters calculated from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) values. KARAZ, a hybrid Internet of things—artificial intelligence platform, was developed in Saudi Arabia to help manage diabetes mellitus. The complex nature of self-care and behavior changes associated with diabetes mellitus requires breaking large behaviors into achievable ones and related incentives. Aim: This study explored how tiny habits as a behavioral intervention and incentive system affect glycemic control among KARAZ Platform users with diabetes mellitus in various age groups in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This retrospective study included KARAZ Platform users and analyzed the effects of behavioral interventions and incentives on GMI and TIR as glycemic control parameters. Results: Of 296 active users, 118 (40%) and 148 (50%) maintained a desirable TIR and GMI, respectively. Adult females aged ≥ 26 years who consistently followed tiny habits and behavior changes exhibited a significant reduction in the GMI (5%). Intrinsic motivation through behavioral modification was more effective than external incentives for maintaining glucose control. Conclusion: The findings highlight how behavioral interventions can impact GMI, suggesting their effectiveness in promoting better health behaviors and improving glycemic control in the Saudi Arabian context. Further research should investigate how these habits and behaviors can be maintained sustainably without relying on external incentives.

Using Large Language Models to Enhance Exercise Recommendations and Physical Activity in Clinical and Healthy Populations: Scoping Review,"Lai, X.; Chen, J.; Lai, Y.; Huang, S.; Cai, Y.; Sun, Z.; Wang, X.; Pan, K.; Gao, Q.; Huang, C.","Background: Regular exercise recommendations (ERs) and physical activity (PA) are crucial for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. However, creating effective exercise programs demand substantial time and specialized expertise from both medical and sports professionals. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising solution by helping create personalized ERs. While LLMs show potential, their use in exercise planning remains in its early stages and requires further exploration. Objectives: This study aims to systematically review and classify the applications of LLMs in ERs and PA. It also seeks to identify existing gaps and provide insights into future research directions for optimizing LLM integration in personalized health interventions. Methods: A scoping review methodology was used to identify studies related to LLM applications in ERs and PA. Literature searches were conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE, and arXiv for English language papers published up to March 21, 2024. Keywords included LLMs, chatbots, ERs, PA, fitness plan, and related terms. Two independent reviewers (XL and CH) screened and selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize findings, which were presented narratively. Results: An initial search identified 598 papers, of which 1.8% (11/598) of studies were included after screening and applying selection criteria. Of these, ChatGPT-based models were used in 55% (6/11) of the studies. In addition, 73% (8/11) of the studies used expert evaluations and user feedback to assess model usability, and 45% (5/11) of the studies used experimental designs to evaluate LLM interventions in ERs and PA. Key findings indicated that LLMs can generate tailored ERs, save time in clinical practice, and enhance safety by incorporating patient-specific data. They also increased engagement and supported behavior change. This made PA guidance more accessible, especially in remote or underserved communities. Conclusions: This review highlights the promising applications of LLMs in ERs and PA but emphasizes that they remain a supplement to human expertise. Expert validation is essential to ensure safety and mitigate risks. Future research should prioritize pilot testing, clinician training programs, and large-scale clinical trials to enhance feasibility, transparency, and ethical integration. © Xiangxun Lai, Jiacheng Chen, Yue Lai, Shengqi Huang, Yongdong Cai, Zhifeng Sun, Xueding Wang, Kaijiang Pan, Qi Gao, Caihua Huang.",2025,,JMIR Medical Informatics,13,,,,10.2196/59309,,#4696,Lai 2025,,,0
Personalized Coaching for Lifestyle Behavior Change through Large Language Models: A Qualitative Study,"Meywirth, S.; Janson, A.; Söllner, M.","This paper investigates the impact of large language model (LLM)-based coaching interventions on enhancing physical activity and nutritional habits, following motivational interviewing guidelines. By exploring user perceptions through qualitative research involving eight interviews, five key themes emerged: the tension between the need for authenticity and reservations about AI humanization, the desire for personalized coaching and autonomy, the necessity of simplifying daily tasks, the aspiration for self-development, and the need for perceived privacy and trust. The findings reveal that perceptions of LLM-based coaching are multifaceted and cannot be easily classified as purely beneficial or concerning; they vary based on the specific implementation. This complexity indicates that certain aspects can simultaneously present both benefits and risks. The paper discusses theoretical implications and offers practical recommendations to enhance the advantages and mitigate the risks associated with LLM-based coaching interventions. © 2025 IEEE Computer Society.

Unveiling Emotional Intensity in Online Reviews: Adopting Advanced Machine Learning Techniques,"Lee, S.J.; de Villiers, R.","The digital revolution has spurred significant growth in online reviews and user-generated content. Traditional methods used in Marketing for analysing large datasets have limitations, emphasising the need for improved analytical approaches, particularly with the advent of artificial intelligence technology. This research used a state-of-the-art transformer model to analyse extensive online book reviews to accurately identify six specific emotions in the reviews of both fiction (hedonic) and nonfiction (utilitarian) genres. This study collected 3,157,703 reviews of 15,293 books voted ‘best book of the year’ on GoodReads.com over the past decade. Our findings reveal noticeable differences in emotional intensity across genres, with nonfiction displaying a slightly higher level of joy, and fiction showing higher levels of anger, sadness and surprise. Joy emerged as the dominant emotion across genres; however, it does not necessarily have a direct impact on book ratings. This study emphasises the intricacies of reader emotions, serving as a significant case study for marketers and publishers aiming to optimise their strategies in the contemporary literary market. The study contributes to the literature on the impact of consumers’ emotional responses, how they are reflected in social review commentary for high-involvement online products, and their impact on product ratings. © 2024 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.",2025,,Australasian Marketing Journal,33,1,75-86,,10.1177/14413582241244808,,#4700,Lee 2025,,,0
LLM-Based Chatbot to Reduce Mental Illness Stigma in Healthcare Providers,"Reategui-Rivera, C.M.; Smiley, A.; Finkelstein, J.","Mental illness stigma in healthcare providers negatively impacts patient care and well-being, yet existing interventions to mitigate this stigma are often resource-intensive and difficult to scale. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a conversational agent (CA) named Stigma Educational Bot 1.0, powered by a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-4. The CA aims to reduce stigma among healthcare providers by delivering an educational program grounded in anti-stigma principles and behavior change theories across four modules. The CA was developed using the GPT Editor interface, incorporating tailored instructions and a curated knowledge base from evidence-based resources, including materials from the Pan American Health Organization. Its performance was evaluated through four key tasks: direct question answering, generation of case scenarios, identification of stigma in simulated clinical interactions, and generation of empathetic testimonies. Expert evaluators assessed the CA's outputs using a 5-point Likert scale and performance metrics such as precision and recall. Results indicate that the CA excels in delivering structured educational content on topics like 'Conditions' (scores of 5.0) but shows limitations in foundational concepts like 'Definition' (scores as low as 2.5). It demonstrated high consistency in language and style when generating case scenarios and testimonies, with perceived empathy scores up to 4.5. However, the CA exhibited moderate performance in identifying stigmatizing behaviors, with F1 scores ranging from 0.48 to 0.54 and lower recall rates, particularly for overt manifestations of stigma. The study highlights the potential of GPT-based conversational agents as scalable tools for stigma reduction among healthcare providers by offering accessible and interactive educational interventions. Limitations include reliance on simulated tasks, specific training materials, and moderate performance in stigma detection. Future work should focus on enhancing foundational knowledge delivery, improving the identification of overt stigmatizing behaviors, and assessing real-world impact. © 2025 IEEE.",2025,,"2025 IEEE 15th Annual Computing and Communication Workshop and Conference, CCWC 2025",,,01-Jul,,10.1109/CCWC62904.2025.10903778,,#4701,Reategui-Rivera 2025,,,0

Perspective on the ethics of AI at the intersection of nutrition and behaviour change,"Abrahams, M.; Raimundo, M.","Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool, that has the potential to impact society on multiple levels. Increased adoption as well as employment of AI in new product development and business processes have led to heightened interest and optimism on one hand, whilst increasing fears of potential negative societal consequences on the other. The ethics of AI has subsequently become a topical issue for academics, industry players, health practitioners and regulators, who have a goal and responsibility to protect the public and limit widening inequality. Despite the publication of numerous AI ethical frameworks, guidelines and regulations, none have specifically focused on nutrition and behaviour change. Advances in technology, including AI and machine learning, have opened up novel ways to deliver personalization to guide individuals towards healthier behaviours or to manage their conditions. This perspective synthesizes the key topics that intersect in nutrition and behaviour change where AI is leveraged to provide personalized advice. We propose a 7-pillar framework to guide the development of ethical and transparent AI solutions to build consumer and practitioner trust.

Predicting proteus effect via the user avatar bond: a longitudinal study using machine learning,"Latifi, M.Q.; Poulus, D.; Richards, M.; Yap, Y.; Stavropoulos, V.","The impact of an avatar on real-world behaviors of users is known as the Proteus Effect. Different user avatar bond (UAB) aspects, including identifying, immersing, and compensating via the avatar, influence an individual’s Proteus Effect propensity. This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) classifiers to automate the prediction of those likely to experience Proteus Effect, based on their reports of identifying, immersing, and compensating with their avatar. Participants were 565 gamers (Mage = 29.3 years; SD = 10.6), assessed twice, six months apart, using the User-Avatar-Bond Scale and the Proteus Effect Scale. Tuned and untuned ML classifiers showed ML models could accurately identify individuals with higher Proteus Effect propensity, informed by a gamer’s reported UAB, age, and length of gaming involvement, both concurrently and longitudinally (i.e., six months later). Random forests performed better than other MLs, with avatar identification as the strongest predictor. This suggests higher Proteus Effect propensity for those with a stronger user-avatar bond, informing gamified health applications to introduce adaptive behavioral changes via the avatar.

The Direct Effect of Managerial Responses: When Politeness Backfires,"Jin, H.; Wang, L.; Liu, Y.; Tong, Y.","                  Managerial responses, which represent firms’ public replies to online reviews, are commonly employed in customer communications. Using a dataset collected from a leading mobile game app platform in China, this research examines the effect of managerial responses on the review updates of customers who receive them, that is, the direct effect of managerial responses. Platform users can update their reviews, and complete records of review updates are observable, which allows us to utilize variations in the same customer’s review ratings of a single game both before and after receiving a managerial response. Addressing concerns regarding the endogeneity of managerial responses, improvements in game quality, and censored data in rating updates, we find that users who update their reviews after receiving managerial responses upgrade their ratings by an average of one star. In addition, we find that the positive direct effect of managerial responses is negatively moderated by the level of response politeness, measured separately using both machine learning and large language models. By conducting a survey study, we further show that as the level of politeness increases, the likelihood of reviewers perceiving a managerial response as an attempt to persuade them also increases. These findings highlight the positive direct effect of managerial response and the importance of response style, specifically politeness, which can produce a backfire effect in online communications. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Production and Operations Management,,,,,10.1177/10591478241309439,,#4707,Jin 2025,,,0
AI-Driven Realtime Monitoring of Early Indicators for Ichthyophthirius multifiliis Infection of Rainbow Trout,"Bonnichsen, R.; Nielsen, G.G.B.; Dam, J.S.; Schrøder-Petersen, D.; Buchmann, K.","A novel video-based real-time system based on AI (artificial intelligence) was developed to detect clinical signs in fish exposed to pathogens. We selected a White Spot Disease model involving rainbow trout as the experimental animal and the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis as a pathogen. We compared two identical fish tank systems: one tank was infected by co-habitation, whereas the other tank was kept non-infected (sham infection). The two fish tanks were separately video monitored (full top and side view) during the course of infection, during which fish were removed whenever they developed clinical signs (direct visual inspection by the observer). Image analysis (object detection, classification and tracking) was used to track behavioural changes in fish (in every recorded video frame), focusing on movement patterns and spatial localisation. Initially, the two fish groups (infected and non-infected) exhibited similar behaviour and non-infected fish did not change behaviour during the 15 d observation period (from 5 d before infection until 10 dpi). At 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 dpi some infected fish showed clinical signs (equilibrium disturbance, gasping and lethargy) and were removed from the experiment. Anorexia occurred from 5 dpi and a gradual progression of gasping behaviour was noted, whereas the frequency of fish flashing (rubbing/scratching against objects) was low. Equilibrium disturbances and the development of white spots in the skin appeared to be a much later (8–10 dpi at this temperature) indicator of infection. The video analysis showed a general distribution of non-infected fish in all parts of the fish tank during the entire experiment, whereas infected fish already at 4–5 dpi moved towards higher water currents in the top and bottom positions. This change of fish positioning within the tank appeared as a promising early indicator of infection. The study suggests that continuous monitoring of fish behaviour using AI can potentially optimise the timing of humane endpoints, indicate disease signs earlier and thereby improve animal welfare in both animal experimentation and in aquaculture settings. © 2024 The Author(s).

Personalized cardiometabolic care powered by artificial intelligence,"Shomali, M.; Kumbara, A.; MacLeod, J.; Iyer, A.","Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are providing a wealth of opportunities for improving clinical practice and healthcare delivery. It is predicted by AI experts that healthcare will change more in the next decade than it has in the previous century due to the volume and speed of these advancing capabilities. In this paper, we will illustrate the potential value of AI by sharing an example of an AI-powered digital health platform, designed to support people living with chronic cardiometabolic conditions and their care teams. The goal is to transform the care continuum from prevention through diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management, including efficient acute care interventions when needed. The intent is to shift from reactive to proactive care including preventive-based guidance and interventions. AI-powered health technologies enable true person-centered care (i.e., for N=1), but for entire populations at scale (i.e., N >> 1), shifting the traditional mass generalization paradigm to one of mass customization. We demonstrate how an AI-powered digital health platform: 1) supports early detection and diagnosis of chronic conditions such as diabetes and related cardiometabolic conditions with data and insights; 2) optimizes personalized treatment; 3) tracks progress; 4) provides education; and 5) enables longitudinal behavior change to sustain health. We will present current AI capabilities as well as future considerations for the industry.

"Promoting mental health in the age of new digital tools: balancing challenges and opportunities of social media, chatbots, and wearables","Coelho, J.; Pécune, F.; Micoulaud-Franchi, J.-A.; Bioulac, B.; Philip, P.","The promotion of mental health is essential for global health, affecting millions with disorders such as anxiety and depression. Although stigma and discrimination hinder progress, these conditions are often preventable or manageable at minimal cost. The adoption of digital tools in mental health promotion, including telemedicine, online therapy, social media, and wearables, offers promising new avenues to address these issues. This review proposes a framework that focuses on the use of digital tools to enhance health literacy, foster behavioral change, and support sustained positive health behaviors. Platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram can effectively disseminate health information, increase awareness, and enhance social accountability. Artificial intelligence-driven virtual agents offer personalised mental health interventions, providing motivational support and customised advice. Additionally, wearable technology (e.g., fitness trackers and smartwatches) enables real-time monitoring of vital health metrics, encouraging ongoing healthy activities. Nonetheless, these technologies introduce challenges including privacy issues, data security, and equitable access to digital resources, raising a new class of rights to protect mental privacy, guard against algorithm bias, and prevent personality-changing manipulations. The absence of human interaction in fully digital solutions also raises concerns about a lack of empathy and emotional connection. For optimal use of digital tools in mental health, integration with conventional care practices and adaptation to diverse cultural and social backgrounds are necessary. The results of this review suggest that digital tools, when carefully implemented, can significantly improve mental health outcomes by making care more accessible, tailored, and effective, especially for underserved communities. 2025 Coelho, Pécune, Micoulaud-Franchi, Bioulac and Philip.",2025,,Frontiers in Digital Health,7,,,,10.3389/fdgth.2025.1560580,,#4722,Coelho 2025,,,0
Healthcare professionals’ perspectives on artificial intelligence (AI)-based mobile applications (apps) for diabetes education and behavioural management,"Lim, P.-C.; Chong, Y.-W.; Chie, Q.-T.; Zainal, H.; Yau, K.-L.A.; Teoh, S.-H.","Background: The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is escalating rapidly. Similarly in Malaysia, diabetes prevalence among adults rose exponentially. Artificial intelligence (AI) integrated into mobile health applications (apps) presents a promising avenue for enhancing diabetes management through personalized patient education and behaviour modification. However, adoption rates remain low, primarily due to limited awareness and technological challenges, especially among older adults. Objective: This study aimed to explore Malaysian healthcare professionals’ (HCPs’) perspectives on the use of AI in mobile apps for diabetes education and behavioural management. Methods: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 19 HCPs across Malaysia. Interviews were conducted via video conferencing, recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis with NVivo 14 software. Results: Seven key themes emerged: (1) acceptance and trust, (2) impact on patient behaviour, (3) skills and abilities required, (4) problems and obstacles, (5) key features and functions, (6) HCPs’ and patients’ information needs, and (7) strategies for increasing patient adoption. HCPs expressed positive sentiments towards AI-based apps, highlighting their potential for continuous, personalized education and real-time feedback. However, significant concerns were raised about accessibility for older adults, data privacy, and the apps’ ability to modify entrenched behaviours without human intervention. Conclusion: AI-based mobile apps show potential for improving diabetes management, but successful implementation requires addressing challenges.

Applications of Behavioral Economics and Neuroeconomics in Mental Health,"Abdullaeva, B.S.; Abdullaev, D.; Djuraeva, L.; Sagdullaeva, D.K.; Kholikov, A.","Objective: The integration of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics into mental health offers innovative perspectives on understanding and addressing psychological disorders. This overview aims to synthesize current knowledge and explore the implications of these interdisciplinary approaches in the context of mental health. Method: In this narrative review, we summarized the current evidence regarding the applications of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics approaches in the field of mental health. Results: Behavioral economics and neuroeconomics provide valuable insights into the cognitive and emotional processes underlying mental health disorders, such as irrational decision-making, impulsivity, and self-control issues. Concepts such as loss aversion, temporal discounting, and framing effects inform the development of innovative interventions and policy initiatives. Behavioral economic interventions, including nudges, incentives, and commitment devices, show promise in promoting treatment adherence, reducing risky behaviors, and enhancing mental well-being. Neuroeconomics contributes by identifying neural markers predictive of treatment response and relapse risk, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches. Conclusion: The integration of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics into mental health research and practice holds significant potential for improving the understanding of psychological disorders and developing more effective, personalized interventions. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action, optimize intervention strategies, and address ethical considerations associated with these approaches in mental health settings. © 2025 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.",2025,,Iranian Journal of Psychiatry,20,1,91-99,,10.18502/ijps.v20i1.17404,,#4727,Abdullaeva 2025,,,0
"Women Empowered to Connect With Addiction Resources and Engage in Evidence-Based Treatment (WE-CARE)—an mHealth Application for the Universal Screening of Alcohol, Substance Use, Depression, and Anxiety: Usability and Feasibility Study","Isaacs, K.; Shifflett, A.; Patel, K.; Karpisek, L.; Cui, Y.; Lawental, M.; Wernette, G.T.; Borsari, B.; Chang, K.; Ma, T.","Background: Women of childbearing age (aged 18-44 years) face multiple barriers to receiving screening and treatment for unhealthy alcohol and substance use, depression, and anxiety, including lack of screening in the primary care setting and lack of support in accessing care. The Women Empowered to Connect with Addiction Resources and Engage in Evidence-based Treatment (WE-CARE) mobile app was developed to test universal screening with women of childbearing age and linkage to care after an anonymous assessment. Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of providing anonymous screening instruments through mobile phones for alcohol and substance use, as well as depression and anxiety, for women of childbearing age. Methods: We used agile development principles based on previous formative research to test WE-CARE mobile health app with women of childbearing age (N=30) who resided in 1 of 6 counties in central Florida. WE-CARE included screening instruments (for alcohol, substance use, depression, and anxiety), a moderated discussion forum, educational microlearning videos, a frequently asked questions section, and resources for linkage to treatment. Individuals were recruited using flyers, academic listserves, and a commercial human subject recruiting company (Prolific). Upon completion of the screening instruments, women explored the educational and linkage to care features of the app and filled out a System Usability Scale to evaluate the mobile health app’s usability and acceptability. Postpilot semistructured interviews (n=4) were conducted to further explore the women’s reactions to the app. Results: A total of 77 women downloaded the application and 30 completed testing. Women of childbearing age gave the WE-CARE app an excellent System Usability Scale score of 86.7 (SD 12.43). Our results indicate elevated risk for substance use in 18 of the 30 (60%) participants, 9/18 (50%) also had an elevated risk for anxiety or depression, and 11/18 (61%) had an elevated risk for substance use, anxiety, or depression. Participants reported that WE-CARE was easy to navigate and use but they would have liked to see more screening questions and more educational content. Linkage to care was an issue; however, as none of the women identified as “at-risk” for substance use disorders contacted the free treatment clinic for further evaluation. Conclusions: The mobile health app was highly rated for acceptability and usability, but participants were not receptive to seeking help at a treatment center after only a few brief encounters with the app. The linkage to care design features was likely insufficient to encourage them to seek treatment. The next version of WE-CARE will include normative scores for participants to self-evaluate their screening status compared with their age- and gender-matched peers and enhanced linkages to care features. Future development will focus on enhancing engagement to improve change behaviors and assess readiness for change. © Krystyna Isaacs, Autumn Shifflett, Kajal Patel, Lacey Karpisek, Yi Cui, Maayan Lawental, Golfo Tzilos Wernette, Brian Borsari, Katie Chang, Tony Ma.",2025,,JMIR Formative Research,9,,,,10.2196/62915,,#4728,Isaacs 2025,,,0
A Theory-Driven Approach to Fake News/Information Disorder Analysis and Explanation via Target-Based Emotion–Stance Analysis (TESA) and Interpretive Graph Generation (IGG),"Chen, X.K.; Na, J.-C.","Information disorder (IDO) presents a persistent challenge to society, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding its dynamics beyond just merely detecting it. This study introduces a theory-driven framework that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning, utilizing the target-based emotion–stance analysis (TESA) approach to analyze emotion and stance dynamics within IDO content. Complementing TESA, interactive graph generation (IGG) is applied for scalable and interpretable qualitative analyses. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study leverages TESA for target-centric emotion and stance analysis, evaluating target-based classifiers on both human-annotated and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the study explores synthetic data generation using generative AI to enrich the analysis, applying IGG to map complex data interactions. The study also found that integrating synthetic data developed from human annotations enhanced model performance, particularly for emotion classification tasks. Results demonstrate that IDO narratives significantly differ from non-IDO narratives, frequently leveraging negative emotions such as anger and disgust to manipulate public perception. TESA proved effective in capturing these nuanced variations, while IGG facilitated the triangulation of such findings via the scalable interpretation of emotional narratives, revealing that IDO content often amplifies polarizing and antagonistic perspectives. By combining TESA and IGG, this research emphasizes the importance of using NLP to extract and examine the emotional and stance nuances toward targets of interest within IDO context. This approach not only deepens theoretical insights into IDO’s persuasive mechanisms but also supports the development of practical tools for analyzing and managing the influence of IDO on public discourse. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Social Science Computer Review,,,,,10.1177/08944393251338403,,#4730,Chen 2025,,,0
A Self-Efficacy Theory-Based Study on the Teachers' Readiness to Teach Artificial Intelligence in Public Schools in Sri Lanka,"Rajapakse, C.; Ariyarathna, W.; Selvakan, S.","Objectives. This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies.Participants. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article.Study Method. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers' readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers' self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach.Findings. This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers' self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers' self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers' own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum.Conclusions. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government's teacher training initiatives.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Ethics in Persuasive Technologies: A Systematic Literature Review,"Rahman, P.; Adaji, I.","Persuasive technologies, which are intended to change users' attitudes or behaviors and encourage specific actions, are widely applied across various domains. However, the fine line between persuasion and coercion raises significant ethical concerns, which current literature only superficially addresses. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of factors influencing the ethical perception of persuasive technologies through a systematic literature review of 17 journal articles. The selected studies were analyzed using content analysis to identify key ethical factors. The findings indicate that factors such as autonomy, consent, data privacy, transparency, and addictive design strategies significantly influence users' ethical perceptions across multiple application domains. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies or AI agents, particularly applications like argumentative chatbots and storytelling robots, exhibit the highest number of ethical considerations. The study also notes thematic overlaps among many ethical factors, with the context and use case impacting ethical perceptions. Based on these results, this paper offers design recommendations and suggestions for the design of ethical persuasive technology applications. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,106-118,,10.1145/3701571.3701572,,#4734,Rahman 2024,,,0
SHAPE-IT: Exploring Text-to-Shape-Display for Generative Shape-Changing Behaviors with LLMs,"Qian, W.; Gao, C.; Sathya, A.; Suzuki, R.; Nakagaki, K.","This paper introduces text-to-shape-display, a novel approach to generating dynamic shape changes in pin-based shape displays through natural language commands. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and AI-chaining, our approach allows users to author shape-changing behaviors on demand through text prompts without programming. We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes. Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10). The study conclusions highlight the ability to facilitate rapid ideation of a wide range of shape-changing behaviors with AI. However, the findings also expose accuracy-related challenges and limitations, prompting further exploration into refining the framework for leveraging AI to better suit the unique requirements of shape-changing systems.  © 2024 ACM.",2024,,UIST 2024 - Proceedings of the 37th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,,,,,10.1145/3654777.3676348,,#4735,Qian 2024,,,0
Developing an Artificial Intelligence-Driven Nudge Intervention to Improve Medication Adherence: A Human-Centred Design Approach,"Sumner, J.; Bundele, A.; Lim, H.W.; Phan, P.; Motani, M.; Mukhopadhyay, A.","To improve medication adherence, we co-developed a digital, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nudge intervention with stakeholders (patients, providers, and technologists). We used a human-centred design approach to incorporate user needs in creating an AI-driven nudge tool. We report the findings of the first stage of a multi-phase project: understanding user needs and ideating solutions. We interviewed healthcare providers (n = 10) and patients (n = 10). Providers also rated example nudge interventions in a survey. Stakeholders felt the intervention could address existing deficits in medication adherence tracking and were optimistic about the solution. Participants identified flexibility of the intervention, including mode of delivery, intervention intensity, and the ability to stratify to user ability and needs, as critical success factors. Reminder nudges and provision of healthcare worker contact were rated highly by all. Conversely, patients perceived incentive-based nudges poorly. Finally, participants suggested that user burden could be minimised by leveraging existing software (rather than creating a new App) and simplifying or automating the data entry requirements where feasible. Stakeholder interviews generated in-depth data on the perspectives and requirements for the proposed solution. The participatory approach will enable us to incorporate user needs into the design and improve the utility of the intervention. Our findings show that an AI-driven nudge tool is an acceptable and appropriate solution, assuming it is flexible to user requirements. © 2023, The Author(s).",2024,,Journal of Medical Systems,48,1,,,10.1007/s10916-023-02024-0,,#4736,Sumner 2024,,,0
Compromises in Dialogical Argumentation: Aggregated Policies for Biparty Decision Theory,"Donadello, I.; de Souza, R.L.; Hunter, A.; Dragoni, M.","Automated persuasion systems (APS) are conversational agents that exchange arguments and counterarguments with users during dialogues to persuade them to believe in something. Such systems use strategies (or policies) to carefully select a sequence of arguments that are tailored to the user’s needs and will likely have a positive outcome, that is, changing the user’s belief in a certain argument. Biparty Decision Theory (BDT) is a framework that uses game theory to formalize a dialogue between an APS and a user, that is, an exchange of (counter) arguments during each turn of the APS or the user. During the APS turn, the BDT policy selects the best argument to maximize only the utility for the APS and neglects the utility of that argument for the user. This is a reasonable choice in games, but in a persuasive dialogue, it can result in arguments that have a high utility for the APS but a modest utility for the user. There the user may be less likely to be persuaded. This is crucial in settings where there are no arguments with good utilities for both the APS and the user and a compromise has to be found. To this extent, we define a new family of policies for BDT, called aggregated policies, that consider, during the decisions of the APS, an aggregation of the APS and user’s utilities. Such an aggregation considers both the APS and the user’s needs leading toward a sequence of arguments representing the best trade-off of utilities. We evaluate the approach using both a new synthetic dataset and a published dataset of utilities for dialogical argumentation. The results show the aggregated policies find better compromise arguments w.r.t. the classical policy of BDT. © 2024 The Authors.",2024,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,392,,3437-3444,,10.3233/FAIA240895,,#4737,Donadello 2024,,,0

Previous interventions designed to prevent obesity in the first 2 years of life have been largely unsuccessful. Obesity prevalence is high among traditional racial and ethnic minority groups. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of adding a digital childhood obesity prevention intervention to health behavior counseling delivered by pediatric primary care clinicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Individually randomized, parallel-group trial conducted at 6 US medical centers and enrolling patients shortly after birth. To be eligible, parents spoke English or Spanish, and children were born after 34 weeks’ gestational age. Study enrollment occurred between October 2019 and January 2022, with follow-up through January 2024. INTERVENTIONS In the clinic-based health behavior counseling (clinic-only) group, pediatric clinicians used health literacy–informed booklets at well-child visits to promote healthy behaviors (n = 451). In the clinic + digital intervention group, families also received health literacy–informed, individually tailored, responsive text messages to support health behavior goals and a web-based dashboard (n = 449). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was child weight-for-length trajectory over 24 months. Secondary outcomes included weight-for-length z score, body mass index (BMI) z score, and the percentage of children with overweight or obesity. RESULTS Of 900 randomized children, 86.3% had primary outcome data at the 24-month follow-up time point; 143 (15.9%) were Black, non-Hispanic; 405 (45.0%) were Hispanic; 185 (20.6%) were White, non-Hispanic; and 165 (18.3%) identified as other or multiple races and ethnicities. Children in the clinic + digital intervention group had a lower mean weight-for-length trajectory, with an estimated reduction of 0.33 kg/m (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.57) at 24 months. There was also an adjusted mean difference of -0.19 (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.02) for weight-for-length z score and -0.19 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.01) for BMI z score. At age 24 months, 23.2% of the clinic + digital intervention group compared with 24.5% of the clinic-only group had overweight or obesity (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.17]) based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria of BMI 85th percentile or greater. At that age, 7.4% of the clinic + digital intervention group compared with 12.7% of the clinic-only group had obesity (adjusted risk ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.88]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A health literacy–informed digital intervention improved child weight-for-length trajectory across the first 24 months of life and reduced childhood obesity at 24 months.

Noticed and appreciated? The role of argument diversity in enhancing news credibility and reader satisfaction,"Zerback, T.; Schneiders, P.","Although viewpoint diversity is a keyvalue for audiences, journalism and media policy, not much is known about how audiences process and evaluate it. This is critical because any positive effect we might expect from a broad range of views (e.g., on opinion formation) requires that recipients recognize and appreciate it as a part of news content. The current study examines how news readers process and evaluate argument diversity as a specific aspect of viewpoint diversity. In a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subject experiment, 1363 subjects were exposed to news reports containing a diverse or homogenous set of arguments in the context of two currently debated issues (artificial intelligence and immigration). Reports were either published by a single or multiple media outlets to determine potential differences between internal and external argument diversity. We find that readers not only recognize the presence of argument diversity, but that it leads to an increase in overall news satisfaction. This increase can be attributed to a higher credibility of news reports with diverse arguments. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Journalism,25,12,2523-2542,,10.1177/14648849231226030,,#4743,Zerback 2024,,,0
Is being human-like beneficial? The effect of anthropomorphism on chatbot persuasion in e-commerce,"Yang, M.; Peng, X.; Wang, Q.; Zhao, Y.C.; Wang, X.","Purpose: Chatbots are vital for enhancing e-commerce sustainability by providing efficient customer support. Although previous studies have considered both linguistic and visual anthropomorphism as crucial factors in e-commerce chatbot design, their joint effects and their underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on insights from the literature on anthropomorphism and the elaboration likelihood model, this research attempts to examine the joint effects of the two types of anthropomorphism, the boundary condition, and the subsequent impact on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: A research model was proposed and empirically tested using two laboratory-controlled experimental studies. Findings: Linguistic anthropomorphism plays a dominant role over visual anthropomorphism in influencing social presence and communicative effectiveness. In addition, linguistic anthropomorphism harms persuasion through the mediating role of communicative effectiveness, and the fit between linguistic and visual anthropomorphism amplifies the negative effect on purchase intention. Moreover, shopping motivation serves as a boundary condition for the negative effect of anthropomorphism. Practical implications: Chatbot designers should be cautious when using anthropomorphism in e-commerce chatbot design. The use of machine-like languages may be more persuasive than that of human-like languages, especially for utilitarian products. Notably, mismatched anthropomorphic elements may harm user experience. Originality/value: This study enriches chatbot literature by examining the role of chatbot anthropomorphism in the e-commerce context. Moreover, this study provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding how chatbots’ linguistic and visual anthropomorphism jointly influence consumer behavior. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2025,,Internet Research,,,,,10.1108/INTR-10-2023-0866,,#4744,Yang 2025,,,0
Entropy-based Planning Algorithm for Personalized Interventions: Preliminary Report on Question-reduction Agent,"Sano, T.; Takahashi, M.; Fujimura, K.; Inoue, T.; Sato, T.; Katagiri, Y.","Prevention of lifestyle diseases is an important issue in terms of both the lifelong well-being of each individual and the burden on society. Although several artificial-intelligence-based chatbots have been proposed to support preventing such diseases, they have not yet reached a complex problem setting that combines multiple theories of behavioral change. In such complex settings, in addition to intervention selection, it is important to reduce the amount of attributes acquired to reduce the user's burden in preventing inhibition of motivation. Therefore, we developed the Entropy-Based Planning algorithm that selects interventions from a small number of questions. To evaluate the algorithm, we conducted a short-term randomized control trial (RCT) with a small number of users as an initial validation. Due to certain limitations, we were unable to obtain results indicating sufficient effectiveness. However, important findings were obtained for the future development of behavioral-change support bots. The findings include the need to investigate the relevance of preferences among multiple behavior-change theories and balance the number of questions and accuracy of personalization on user impressions. We intend to conduct further research on the basis of these findings as well as conduct a large-scale RCT after improving the algorithm and experiment settings. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,,UbiComp Companion 2024 - Companion of the 2024 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing,,,86-90,,10.1145/3675094.3677590,,#4746,Sano 2024,,,0
An overview of technologies available to monitor behaviours of mosquitoes,"Javed, N.; Paradkar, P.N.; Bhatti, A.","Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, resulting in over 600,000 deaths from malaria and around 36,000 deaths from dengue each year, with millions of people infected annually, leading to substantial economic losses. The existing mosquito control measures, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), helped to reduce the infections. However, mosquito-borne diseases are still among the deadliest diseases, forcing us to improve the existing control methods and look for alternative methods simultaneously. Advanced monitoring techniques, including remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) have significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of mosquito control measures. Mosquitoes’ behavioural traits, such as locomotion, blood-feeding, and fertility are the key determinants of disease transmission and epidemiology. Technological advancements, such as high-resolution cameras, infrared imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI) driven object detection models, including groundbreaking convolutional neural networks, have provided efficient and precise options to monitor various mosquito behaviours, including locomotion, oviposition, fertility, and host-seeking. However, they are not commonly employed in mosquito-based research. This review highlights the novel and significant advancements in behaviour-monitoring tools, mostly from the last decade, due to cutting-edge video monitoring technology and artificial intelligence. These advancements can offer enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to quickly process large volumes of data, enabling detailed behavioural analysis over extended periods and large sample sizes, unlike traditional manual methods prone to human error and labour-intensive. The use of behaviour-assaying techniques can support or replace existing monitoring techniques and directly contribute to improving control measures by providing more accurate and real-time data on mosquito activity patterns and responses to interventions. This enhanced understanding can help establish the role of behavioural changes in improving epidemiological models, making them more precise and dynamic. As a result, mosquito management strategies can become more adaptive and responsive, leading to more effective and targeted interventions. Ultimately, this will reduce disease transmission and significantly improve public health outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Acta Tropica,258,,,,10.1016/j.actatropica.2024.107347,,#4747,Javed 2024,,,0
Australian healthcare workers’ views on artificial intelligence in BreastScreen: Results of a mixed method survey study,"Tang, J.S.; Frazer, H.M.; Kunicki, K.; Basnayake, P.; Omori, M.; Lippey, J.","Introduction: The evolving role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine, particularly in radiology and population-based breast cancer screening programs, offers potential accuracy gains and efficiency improvements. However, successful implementation requires understanding of healthcare workers’ views on AI, which this study aims to explore within the Australian BreastScreen program. Methods: An online survey was distributed to clinical staff involved in breast imaging, collecting responses from November 2022 to April 2023. The survey encompassed demographic information, opinions, and experiences with AI in medical imaging, with questions covering various scenarios of AI integration in BreastScreen. Results: Out of an estimated 350 professionals contacted, 95 responded, with 84.2 % (80/95) being radiologists. Less than half of respondents (44.9 %, 40/89) had worked with artificial intelligence for image classification previously. The majority of radiologists 74.2 % (46/62) thought that the use of AI in reading mammograms for BreastScreen would improve workflow. However, radiologists thought they would behave with increasing caution with scenarios where AI was more autonomous, with the majority of radiologists (63.3 %, 38/60) uncomfortable with holding accountability when the AI was used to triage and remove cases from the workflow. Notably, 60 % of radiologists (36/60) expressed concerns about accountability. Discussion: The findings suggest an optimistic attitude towards AI among Australian healthcare workers, although when given hypothetical scenarios for the way AI could be integrated into BreastScreen, there was increasing caution with scenarios where AI was more autonomous. This study highlights understanding and concerns of healthcare professionals working in population screening which are important to address when implementing AI into the healthcare system. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Preventive Medicine Reports,48,,,,10.1016/j.pmedr.2024.102917,,#4748,Tang 2024,,,0
"Effectiveness of chatbots in increasing uptake, intention, and attitudes related to any type of vaccination: A systematic review and meta-analysis","Chan, P.S.-F.; Fang, Y.; Cheung, D.H.; Zhang, Q.; Sun, F.; Mo, P.K.H.; Wang, Z.","This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed and summarized the growing literature on the effectiveness of chatbot-delivered interventions in increasing uptake, intention, and attitudes related to any type of vaccination. We identified randomized controlled studies (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and non-experimental studies from the following platforms: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo, and EMBASE databases. A total of 12 eligible studies published from 2019 to 2023 were analyzed and summarized. In particular, one RCT showed that a chatbot-delivered tailored intervention was more effective than a chatbot-delivered non-tailored intervention in promoting seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among older adults (50.5% versus 35.3%, p = 0.002). Six RCTs were included in the meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of chatbot interventions to improve vaccination attitudes and intentions. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of overall attitude change was 0.34 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.13, 0.55, p = 0.001). We found a non-significant trivial effect of chatbot interventions on improving intentions of vaccination (SMD: 0.11, 95% CI: −0.13, 0.34, p = 0.38). However, further evidence is needed to draw a more precise conclusion. Additionally, study participants reported high satisfaction levels of using the chatbot and were likely to recommend it to others. The development of chatbots is still nascent and rooms for improvement exist. © 2024 The Author(s).

Privacy in Personalized Advertising: A Comprehensive Review and Future Agenda,"Joyee De, S.; Chattopadhyay, M.","While personalized advertising may increase customer’s desire to engage with a firm, privacy concerns over how firms process data for personalization may reduce their engagement and lead to ad avoidance. As marketers increasingly benefit from personalized advertising, the domain of privacy in personalized advertising (PPA) is gaining attention from researchers in both Marketing and Information Systems areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review from extant literature, combining bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the current state, primary themes, and future prospects of the PPA literature. Our research indicates that PPA research is in its early stages of development. While existing literature has predominantly examined privacy, personalization, trust, advertising, social media and e-commerce, there has been a growing emphasis on targeted advertising and artificial intelligence in more recent studies. PPA is grounded in theoretical frameworks from privacy like Privacy Calculus Theory and from marketing such as Persuasion Knowledge Model. Given that customer privacy concerns and trust in a firm can influence ad outcomes negatively, it is essential for researchers to explore scenarios where personalization might prove ineffective. In addition, examining firm strategies regarding personalized ads to mitigate negative ad outcomes is crucial. © 2025 by the Association for Information Systems.",2025,,Communications of the Association for Information Systems,56,,,,10.17705/1cais.05613,,#4750,JoyeeDe 2025,,,0
"Etiology of Late-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease, Biomarker Efficacy, and the Role of Machine Learning in Stage Diagnosis","Sarma, M.; Chatterjee, S.","Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a subtype of dementia that manifests after the age of 65. It is characterized by progressive impairments in cognitive functions, behavioral changes, and learning difficulties. Given the progressive nature of the disease, early diagnosis is crucial. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) is solely attributable to genetic factors, whereas LOAD has multiple contributing factors. A complex pathway mechanism involving multiple factors contributes to LOAD progression. Employing a systems biology approach, our analysis encompassed the genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors that modulate the molecular networks and pathways. These factors affect the brain’s structural integrity, functional capacity, and connectivity, ultimately leading to the manifestation of the disease. This study has aggregated diverse biomarkers associated with factors capable of altering the molecular networks and pathways that influence brain structure, functionality, and connectivity. These biomarkers serve as potential early indicators for AD diagnosis and are designated as early biomarkers. The other biomarker datasets associated with the brain structure, functionality, connectivity, and related parameters of an individual are broadly categorized as clinical-stage biomarkers. This study has compiled research papers on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing machine learning (ML) methodologies from both categories of biomarker data, including the applications of ML techniques for AD diagnosis. The broad objectives of our study are research gap identification, assessment of biomarker efficacy, and the most effective or prevalent ML technology used in AD diagnosis. This paper examines the predominant use of deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing various types of biomarker data. Furthermore, this study has addressed the potential scope of using generative AI and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Diagnostics,14,23,,,10.3390/diagnostics14232640,,#4751,Sarma 2024,,,0
Information and communication technology-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases: A scoping review,"Yoon, J.; Lee, S.-B.; Cho, S.-K.; Sung, Y.-K.","Objective: This review aimed to map the existing the information and communication technology (ICT)-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and identify key effectiveness factors and guidelines for professionals. Methods: A scoping review systematically reviewed PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE and Web of Science. We designed search strategies to identify ICT-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases focused on rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, published between January 2011 and October 2023. Data extraction was independently screened by two reviewers according to the eligibility criteria. Results: Of 13,861 records, 18 met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were randomized controlled trials, primarily conducted in the USA, focusing on rheumatoid arthritis. ICT-based interventions included web-based platforms, aiming to improve self-management, medication adherence, with most interventions showing significant improvements. Digital tools such as websites, chatbots were common. Five groups representing the ICT functions were identified: digital self-management tools, multimedia learning materials, personalized educational sessions, behavior change and empathy games, and interactive online communities and peer support. Most studies lacked theoretical frameworks, or guidelines for developing patient education. Conclusion: ICT-based patient education has significant potential for enhancing self-management and behavior changes in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. © 2024",2024,,Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism,69,,,,10.1016/j.semarthrit.2024.152575,,#4752,Yoon 2024,,,0
Toward the Adoption of Explainable Pre-Trained Large Language Models for Classifying Human-Written and AI-Generated Sentences,"Petrillo, L.; Martinelli, F.; Santone, A.; Mercaldo, F.","Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, including understanding, writing, and performing many tasks in natural language. Moreover, with time and improvements in training and text generation techniques, these models are proving efficient at generating increasingly human-like content. However, they can also be modified to generate persuasive, contextual content weaponized for malicious purposes, including disinformation and novel social engineering attacks. In this paper, we present a study on identifying human- and AI-generated content using different models. Precisely, we fine-tune different models belonging to the BERT family, an open-source version of the GPT model, ELECTRA, and XLNet, and then perform a text classification task using two different labeled datasets—the first one consisting of 25,000 sentences generated by both AI and humans and the second comprising 22,929 abstracts that are ChatGPT-generated and written by humans. Furthermore, we perform an additional phase where we submit 20 sentences generated by ChatGPT and 20 sentences randomly extracted from Wikipedia to our fine-tuned models to verify the efficiency and robustness of the latter. In order to understand the prediction of the models, we performed an explainability phase using two sentences: one generated by the AI and one written by a human. We leveraged the integrated gradients and token importance techniques, analyzing the words and subwords of the two sentences. As a result of the first experiment, we achieved an average accuracy of 99%, precision of 98%, recall of 99%, and F1-score of 99%. For the second experiment, we reached an average accuracy of 51%, precision of 50%, recall of 52%, and F1-score of 51%. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Electronics (Switzerland),13,20,,,10.3390/electronics13204057,,#4753,Petrillo 2024,,,0
Digital therapeutics in hypertension: How to make sustainable lifestyle changes,"Chen, C.; Liu, A.; Zhang, Z.; Chen, J.; Huang, H.","Various digital therapeutic products have been validated and approved since 2017. They have demonstrated efficacy and safety as a new therapeutic modality in various disorders or conditions. Hypertension is a common but serious condition that can be prevented or controlled with lifestyle changes and medicines.

How real is real enough? Unveiling the diverse power of generative AI-enabled virtual influencers and the dynamics of human responses,"Sorosrungruang, T.; Ameen, N.; Hackley, C.","Virtual influencers in various forms are capturing a growing share of ad spend from human influencers. Followers respond to virtual influencers much as if they were human, with engagement rates and measures of trust and source credibility that rival their human counterparts. However, there is an acute need for more nuanced understanding of the differential characteristics of user engagement with human influencers and the many emerging forms, types and interactional characteristics of virtual influencers. We conduct an exploratory study of three parts. First, through an indepth review of the existing literature, we delineate the implications of unsettled taxonomies of virtual influencers by function and form, and we outline a revised typology. Second, our secondary review of virtual influencer literature, trade, and industry sources conceptualizes divergent factors influencing the persuasive capability of human and virtual influencers while identifying intersecting research themes. From this synthesis we induce suggestions for future research and practice.

How customers respond to chatbot anthropomorphism: the mediating roles of perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness,"Li, Y.; Hou, R.; Tan, R.","Purpose: This study aims to investigate how chatbots’ warmth and competence affect customer behavioural expectation (i.e. purchase, recommendation) through perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, prior knowledge of chatbot is considered the boundary condition of the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence. Design/methodology/approach: A lab-in-field experiment with 213 participants and a scenario-based experiment of 186 participants were used to test the model using partial least squares structural equation modelling via SmartPLS 4. Findings: Chatbot warmth positively affects customer behavioural expectation through perceived humanness while chatbot competence positively affects customer behavioural expectation through perceived persuasiveness. Prior knowledge of chatbot positively moderates the effect of chatbot warmth on perceived humanness. Research limitations/implications: This study provides nuanced insights into the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence on customer behavioural expectation. Future studies could extend the model by exploring additional boundary conditions of the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence in different generations.

Assessing Emotion Mitigation through Robot Facial Expressions for Human-Robot Interaction,"D'Arco, L.; Rossi, A.; Rossi, S.","Affective responses are one of the primary and clearer signals used by agents for communicating their internal state. These internal states can represent a positive or negative acceptance of a robotic agent's behavior during a humanrobot interaction (HRI). In these scenarios, it is fundamental for robots to be able to interpret people's emotional responses and to adjust their behaviors accordingly, to appease them, and to provoke an emotional change in them. This research investigates the impact of robot facial expressions on human emotional experiences within HRI, focusing specifically on whether a robot's expressions can amplify or mitigate users' emotional responses when viewing emotion-eliciting videos. To evaluate participants' emotional states, an AI-based multimodal emotion recognition approach was employed, combining analysis of facial expressions and physiological signals, complemented by a self-assessment questionnaire. Findings indicate that participants responded more positively when the robot's facial expressions aligned with the emotional tone of the videos, suggesting that emotioncoherent displays could enhance user experience and strengthen engagement. These results underscore the potential for expressive social robots to influence human emotions effectively, offering promising applications in therapy, education, and entertainment. By incorporating emotional facial expressions, socially assistive robots could foster behavior change and emotional engagement in HRI, broadening their role in supporting human emotional well-being.  © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2025,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3932,,46-51,,,,#4759,D'Arco 2025,,,0
A comparative analysis of CDC and AI-generated health information using computer-aided text analysis,"Young, A.; Omosun, F.","Background: AI-generated content is easy to access. Members of the public use it as an alternative or to supplement official sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the quality and reliability of AI-generated health information is questionable. This study aims to understand how AI-generated health information differs from that provided by the CDC, particularly in terms of sentiment, readability, and overall quality. Language expectancy theory serves as a framework and offers insights into how people’s expectations of message content from different sources can influence perceived credibility and persuasiveness of such information. Methods: Computer-aided text analysis was used to analyze 20 text entries from the CDC and 20 entries generated by ChatGPT 3.5. Content analysis utilizing human coders was used to assess the quality of information. Results: ChatGPT used more negative sentiments, particularly words associated with anger, sadness, and disgust. The CDC's health messages were significantly easier to read than those generated by ChatGPT. Furthermore, ChatGPT’s responses required a higher reading grade level. In terms of quality, the CDC's information was a little higher quality than that of ChatGPT, with significant differences in DISCERN scores. Conclusion: Public health professionals need to educate the general public about the complexity and quality of AI-generated health information.

"Beyond ideals: why the (medical) AI industry needs to motivate behavioural change in line with fairness and transparency values, and how it can do it","Liefgreen, A.; Weinstein, N.; Wachter, S.; Mittelstadt, B.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly relied upon by clinicians for making diagnostic and treatment decisions, playing an important role in imaging, diagnosis, risk analysis, lifestyle monitoring, and health information management. While research has identified biases in healthcare AI systems and proposed technical solutions to address these, we argue that effective solutions require human engagement. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on how to motivate the adoption of these solutions and promote investment in designing AI systems that align with values such as transparency and fairness from the outset. Drawing on insights from psychological theories, we assert the need to understand the values that underlie decisions made by individuals involved in creating and deploying AI systems. We describe how this understanding can be leveraged to increase engagement with de-biasing and fairness-enhancing practices within the AI healthcare industry, ultimately leading to sustained behavioral change via autonomy-supportive communication strategies rooted in motivational and social psychology theories. In developing these pathways to engagement, we consider the norms and needs that govern the AI healthcare domain, and we evaluate incentives for maintaining the status quo against economic, legal, and social incentives for behavior change in line with transparency and fairness values. © The Author(s) 2023.",2024,,AI and Society,39,5,2183-2199,,10.1007/s00146-023-01684-3,,#4761,Liefgreen 2024,,,0
An unsupervised anomaly detection framework for smart assisted living via growing neural gas networks,"Ciprian, M.; Gadaleta, M.; Rossi, M.","In this study, we present a novel framework for detecting anomalies in everyday activities within a smart-home environment. Our method utilizes the growing neural gas (GNG) concept to dynamically adapt to the changing behaviors of monitored individuals, eliminating the need for supervised input. To develop and evaluate our framework, we collected real-life data from environmental sensors that tracked the daily activities of 17 elderly subjects over a continuous two-year period. The proposed approach is highly versatile, capable of detecting a wide range of anomalies associated with daily living activities. We focus on activities that exhibit abnormal duration, frequency, or entirely new behaviors that deviate from established routines. The performance evaluation of our framework revolves around two key aspects: reliability and adaptability. Reliability measures the accuracy of detecting unusual events, while adaptability assesses the system's ability to accommodate changes in user behavior. This involves recognizing recurrent anomalous behaviors as new norms over time and transitioning from persistent anomalies during an initial phase. Our proposed anomaly detection system demonstrates promising results in real-life scenarios. It achieves good reliability, with true negative rate and true positive rate exceeding 90% and 80% respectively, across all activities and users. Additionally, the system swiftly adapts to new individuals or their evolving behaviors, adjusting within a span of 3 to 7 days for new behaviors.  © 2024 - IOS Press.

Analyzing the impact of conversation structure on predicting persuasive comments online,"Capuano, N.; Meyer, M.; Nota, F.D.","The topic of persuasion in online conversations has social, political and security implications; as a consequence, the problem of predicting persuasive comments in online discussions is receiving increasing attention in the literature. Following recent advancements in graph neural networks, we analyze the impact of conversation structure in predicting persuasive comments in online discussions. We evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence models receiving as input graphs constructed on the top of online conversations sourced from the “Change My View” Reddit channel. We experiment with different graph architectures and compare the performance on graph neural networks, as structure-based models, and dense neural networks as baseline models. Experiments are conducted on two tasks: (1) persuasive comment detection, aiming to predict which comments are persuasive, and (2) influence prediction, aiming to predict which users are persuasive. The experimental results show that the role of the conversation structure in predicting persuasiveness is strongly dependent on its graph representation given as input to the graph neural network. In particular, a graph structure linking only comments belonging to the same speaker in the conversation achieves the best performance in both tasks. This structure outperforms both the baseline model, which does not consider any structural information, and structures linking different speakers’ comments with each other. Specifically, the F1 score of the best performing model is 0.58, which represents an improvement of 5.45% over the baseline model (F1 score of 0.55) and 7.41% over the model linking different speakers’ comments (F1 score of 0.54). © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,15,11,3719-3732,,10.1007/s12652-024-04841-8,,#4769,Capuano 2024,,,0
Computational neurosciences and quantitative systems pharmacology: a powerful combination for supporting drug development in neurodegenerative diseases,"Geerts, H.; Bergeler, S.; Lytton, W.W.; van der Graaf, P.H.","Successful clinical development of new therapeutic interventions is notoriously difficult, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, where predictive biomarkers are scarce and functional improvement is often based on patient’s perception, captured by structured interviews. As a consequence, mechanistic modeling of the processes relevant to therapeutic interventions in CNS disorders has been lagging behind other disease indications, probably because of the perceived complexity of the brain. However in this report, we develop the argument that a combination of Computational Neurosciences and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling of molecular pathways is a powerful simulation tool to enhance the probability of successful drug development for neurodegenerative diseases. Computational Neurosciences aims to predict action potential dynamics and neuronal circuit activation that are ultimately linked to behavioral changes and clinically relevant functional outcomes. These processes can not only be affected by the disease state, but also by common genotype variants on neurotransmitter-related proteins and the psycho-active medications often prescribed in these patient populations. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling of molecular pathways allows to simulate key pathological drivers of dementia, such as protein aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses. They often impact neurotransmitter homeostasis and voltage-gated ion-channels or lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to changes in action potential dynamics and clinical readouts. Combining these two modeling approaches can lead to better actionable understanding of the many non-linear pharmacodynamic processes active in the human diseased brain. Practical applications include a rational selection of the optimal doses in combination therapies, identification of subjects more likely to respond to treatment, a more balanced stratification of treatment arms in terms of comedications, disease status and common genotype variants and re-analysis of small clinical trials to uncover a possible clinical signal. Ultimately this will lead to a higher success rate of bringing new therapeutics to the right patient populations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Journal of Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics,51,5,563-573,,10.1007/s10928-023-09876-6,,#4770,Geerts 2024,,,0
Evaluation of the Digital Support Tool Gro Health W8Buddy as Part of Tier 3 Weight Management Service: Observational Study,"Hanson, P.; Abdelhameed, F.; Sahir, M.; Parsons, N.; Panesar, A.; de la Fosse, M.; Summers, C.; Kaura, A.; Randeva, H.; Menon, V.; Barber, T.M.","Background: The escalating prevalence of obesity worldwide increases the risk of chronic diseases and diminishes life expectancy, with a growing economic burden necessitating urgent intervention. The existing tiered approach to weight management, particularly specialist tier 3 services, falls short of meeting the population’s needs. The emergence of digital health tools, while promising, remains underexplored in specialized National Health Service weight management services (WMSs). Objective: This service evaluation study assessed the use, effectiveness, and clinical impact of the W8Buddy digital support tool as part of the National Health Service WMS. Methods: W8Buddy, a personalized digital platform, provides a tailored weight management plan to empower individuals and was collaboratively developed with input from patients, the clinical team, and DDM Health. It launched at the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire tier 3 WMS in 2022. All patients accessing University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire WMS were offered W8Buddy as part of standard care. Data were analyzed using independent samples t tests and Fisher exact tests for continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis explored associations between participant weight, engagement with W8Buddy, and time in the service. Results: Complete datasets for weights were available for 421 patients (220 W8Buddy group and 192 nonuser control group). W8Buddy users, predominantly female (n=185, 84.1%) and Caucasian, had a mean age of 43 years, while nonusers averaged 46 years (P=.02). Starting weights were comparable: 134 kg in the W8Buddy group and 130.2 kg in controls (P=.14); however, W8Buddy users had slightly higher starting BMI (49.6 vs 46.8 kg/m2, P=.08). A total of 33.5% (n=392) of patients activated W8Buddy and engaged with it. There was significant weight loss among W8Buddy users, with a 0.74 kg monthly loss compared to standard care (β=–.74, 95% CI –1.28 to –0.21; P=.007). The longer an individual stayed in this study and used W8Buddy, the more weight was lost. W8Buddy users with type 2 diabetes mellitus experienced a significant hemoglobin A1c reduction (59.8 to 51.2 mmol/mol, P=.02) compared to nonusers with type 2 diabetes. W8Buddy users also showed significant improvement across the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, and quality of life visual analog scale (P<.001) during follow-up. Conclusions: Participants engaging with W8Buddy as part of a digitally enabled tier 3 WMS demonstrated significant improvements in clinical and psychological outcomes, with weight changes statistically significant compared to those not engaging with the digital tool. Reduction in hemoglobin A1c was present in both groups; however, statistical significance was only reached among those engaging with W8Buddy. These findings suggest digital tools can augment traditional services and promote patient empowerment. Future studies must provide long-term data to understand if the benefits from the digital tool are sustained. ©Petra Hanson, Farah Abdelhameed, Mohammed Sahir, Nick Parsons, Arjun Panesar, Michaela de la Fosse, Charlotte Summers, Amit Kaura, Harpal Randeva, Vinod Menon, Thomas M Barber.",2025,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,27,1,,,10.2196/62661,,#4771,Hanson 2025,,,0
Things that go against one′s will: The anti-default effect of default choices on users′ intention to disclose privacy,"Guowei, Z.H.U.; Yingyu, L.U.O.; Jinfeng, L.U.; Wenli, G.A.O.","In the digital economy, the privacy of users′ data is becoming an essential element of business success. For example, Amazon, Spotify, Tencent, and other enterprises adopt artificial intelligence technology to combine user privacy data with business practices′ upstream and downstream context to control consumers′ choices. However, under the double pressure of privacy public events and laws, it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to collect private information from users. To obtain user information, enterprises commonly set up an information authorization interface when users enter the platform. In particular, many platforms adopt a privacy choice option mode. That is, when providing sets of options to users, they intentionally set authorization options such as “allow” and “agree” as their defaults to guide users to disclose their privacy disclosure intentions. This study focuses on the impact of the presentation of authorization options on users′ willingness to disclose privacy. Based on the theory of persuasion knowledge, the authors explore how and why the privacy choice options (default choice: with vs. none) affect users′ intention to disclose privacy. Through 5 experiments, the results showed that compared with the display mode without default choice options, the display mode with default choice options led to lower privacy disclosure intention because users feel that the default behaviour of the platform has a commercial purpose through their persuasion knowledge and thus have the feeling of being manipulated and then have psychological resistance to the default choice behaviour of the platform. The study calls this the anti-default effect of privacy choice. Furthermore, the researchers found that cognitive load moderated the impact of the presentation of choice options on privacy disclosure intentions. Specifically, when users are under low cognitive load, the anti-default effect of privacy choice still exists. This effect is weakened when the user is under a high cognitive load. This paper has three theoretical contributions. First, it reveals the negative impact of default choice on privacy disclosure from a new perspective of privacy choice options. In past studies, scholars mainly focused on the impact of the interpretation of privacy authorization content on users′ privacy disclosure intention. For example, previous studies examined the context of whether the platform provides a privacy explanation and the sensitivity of authorization information. However, these studies ignored the possible impact of authorization options, another key element of the authorization interface. To address this problem, this paper focuses on the impact of privacy choice options on users′ willingness to disclose privacy and proves that default choice will reduce users′ willingness to disclose privacy. Second, this paper explores the mechanism of the presentation of authorization options on the intention to disclose privacy, which is helpful in promoting the literature on anti-default effects. First, default options are often used in economic decision-making and public policy areas and often show default effects. This study extends it to the field of privacy decisions and discusses the possible influence of the presentation method of default choice in the field of privacy. Second, the mechanisms of the default and anti-default effects are still different. The research states that users will have different perceptions of default options under different situations based on their inner persuasion knowledge. If users have negative perceptions, the anti-default effect is more likely to occur. The default effect is more likely to occur if the user has a positive perception. Finally, previous studies have put forwards corresponding views on how default options affect individual perception, such as perceived meaning changes, attention limitations, and processing limitations. Based on the theory of persuasion knowledge, the research proposes that the default option will make users perceive that they are being manipulated, thus generating psychological resistance to the platform and affecting users′ willingness to disclose their private information. This finding on the mechanism also corresponds to some scholars′ views on the anti-default effect of charitable donations. Finally, this paper explores the boundary conditions of cognitive load on users′ willingness to disclose privacy, which echoes the topic of user cognition in the context of current information overload. Cognitive load has been widely considered in consumer behaviour research, such as consumer choice and sponsorship. However, no research has paid attention to privacy disclosure. In this study, it is proposed that when cognitive load is low, the impact of stimulus information on users′ willingness to disclose privacy will not be affected. When the cognitive load is high, the influence of stimulus information on users′ willingness to disclose privacy will be weakened. This finding makes up for the gap in cognitive load in the field of privacy disclosure to some extent. It promotes the understanding of when and why users′ privacy disclosure behaviour changes. © (2025), (Zhejiang University).

AUTOMATED INFLUENCE AND VALUE COLLAPSE Resisting the Control Argument,"White, D.J.","Automated influence is one of the most pervasive applications of artificial intelligence in our day-to-day lives, yet a thoroughgoing account of its associated individual and societal harms is lacking. By far the most widespread, compelling, and intuitive account of the harms associated with automated influence follows what I call the control argument. This argument suggests that users are persuaded, manipulated, and influenced by automated influence in a way that they have little or no control over. Based on evidence about the effectiveness of targeted advertising as well as empirical results about the nature of attentional control, I provide reasons to reject this argument. In turn, I use C. Thi Nguyen’s theory of value collapse to develop a new account of the harmfulness of automated influence. ©2024 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.",2024,,American Philosophical Quarterly,61,4,369-386,,10.5406/21521123.61.4.06,,#4773,White 2024,,,0
Mechanoresponsive regulation of tissue regeneration during distraction osteogenesis,"Hu, W.; Guo, Z.; Tang, W.; Long, J.","Distraction osteogenesis is widely used for bone tissue engineering. Mechanical stimulation plays a central role in the massive tissue regeneration observed during distraction osteogenesis. Although distraction osteogenesis has been a boon for patients with bone defects, we still have limited knowledge about the intrinsic mechanotransduction that converts physical forces into biochemical signals capable of inducing cell behavior changes and new tissue formation. In this review, we summarize the findings for mechanoresponsive factors, including cells, genes, and signaling pathways, during the distraction osteogenesis different phases. These elements function for coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis via the Integrin-FAK, TGF-β/BMP, Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α signaling pathways in a mechanoresponsive niche. The available evidence further suggests the existence of a balance between the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and mesenchymal–epithelial transition under hypoxic stress. We also briefly summarize the current in silico simulation algorithms and propose several future research directions that may advance understanding of distraction osteogenesis in the era of bioinformation, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence models with reliable single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The objective of this review is to utilize established knowledge to further optimize existing distraction protocols and to identify potential therapeutic targets. © 2024 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.",2024,,FASEB Journal,38,18,,,10.1096/fj.202401303R,,#4774,Hu 2024,,,0

Enhancing mechanical performance of steel-tube-encased HSC composite walls: Experimental investigation and analytical modeling,"Chen, Z.; Wang, R.-Y.; Meng, Y.; Wu, H.; Lai, B.; Chen, T.","This paper discusses the study of concrete composite walls of algorithmic modeling, in which steel tubes are embedded. The load-bearing capacity of STHC composite walls increases with the increase of axial load coefficient, but its ductility decreases. The load-bearing capacity can be improved by increasing the strength of the steel pipes; however, the elasticity of STHC composite walls was found to be slightly reduced. As the shear stress coefficient increases, the load-bearing capacity of STHC composite walls decreases significantly, while the deformation resistance increases. By analyzing actual cases, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the research results in real situations and enhance the persuasiveness of the conclusions. The research results can provide a basis for future research, inspire more explorations on seismic design and construction, and further advance the development of this field. Emphasize the importance of research results, promote interdisciplinary cooperation in the fields of structural engineering, earthquake engineering, and materials science, and improve overall seismic resistance. The emphasis on these aspects will help highlight the practical impact of the research results, further strengthen the conclusions, and promote progress in the design and construction of earthquake-resistant structures. The goals of this work are access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, promotion of inclusive and sustainable urbanization and participation, implementation of sustainable and disaster-resilient architecture, sustainable planning and management of human settlements. Simulation results of linear and nonlinear structures show that this method can detect structural parameters and their changes due to damage and unknown disturbances. Therefore, it is believed that with the further development of fuzzy neural network artificial intelligence theory, this goal will be achieved in the near future.  © 2024 Techno-Press, Ltd.",2024,,Steel and Composite Structures,52,6,647-656,,10.12989/scs.2024.52.6.647,,#4777,Chen 2024,,,0
Opening the digital doorway to sexual healthcare: Recommendations from a behaviour change wheel analysis of barriers and facilitators to seeking online sexual health information and support among underserved populations,"McLeod, J.; Estcourt, C.S.; MacDonald, J.; Gibbs, J.; Woode Owusu, M.; Mapp, F.; Gallego Marquez, N.; McInnes-Dean, A.; Saunders, J.M.; Blandford, A.; Flowers, P.","Background The ability to access and navigate online sexual health information and support is increasingly needed in order to engage with wider sexual healthcare. However, people from underserved populations may struggle to pass though this “digital doorway”. Therefore, using a behavioural science approach, we first aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to i) seeking online sexual health information and ii) seeking online sexual health support. Subsequently, we aimed to generate theory-informed recommendations to improve these access points. Methods The PROGRESSPlus framework guided purposive recruitment (15.10.21–18.03.22) of 35 UK participants from diverse backgrounds, including 51% from the most deprived areas and 26% from minoritised ethnic groups. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we identified barriers and facilitators to seeking online sexual health information and support. A Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) analysis then identified recommendations to better meet the needs of underserved populations. Results We found diverse barriers and facilitators. Barriers included low awareness of and familiarity with online information and support; perceptions that online information and support were unlikely to meet the needs of underserved populations; overwhelming volume of information sources; lack of personal relevancy; chatbots/automated responses; and response wait times. Facilitators included clarity about credibility and quality; inclusive content; and in-person assistance. Recommendations included: Education and Persuasion e.g., online and offline promotion and endorsement by healthcare professionals and peers; Training and Modelling e.g., accessible training to enhance searching skills and credibility appraisal; and Environmental Restructuring and Enablement e.g., modifications to ensure online information and support are simple and easy to use, including video/audio options for content. Conclusions Given that access to many sexual health services is now digital, our analyses produced recommendations pivotal to increasing access to wider sexual healthcare among underserved populations. Implementing these recommendations could reduce inequalities associated with accessing and using online sexual health service. © 2025 McLeod et al.

How Do Virtual AI Streamers Influence Viewers’ Livestream Shopping Behavior? The Effects of Persuasive Factors and the Mediating Role of Arousal,"Zhang, X.; Shi, Y.; Li, T.; Guan, Y.; Cui, X.","With the exponential growth of livestream shopping and the development of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual influencers powered by AI have become a new trend. However, this phenomenon has yet to be studied precisely to understand the underlying mechanisms of virtual AI streamers’ influence on the viewers. This study explores the effects of virtual influencers powered by AI by investigating the persuasive factors and underlying emotional mechanism that affect viewers’ parasocial interaction intention and impulse buying intention. Data collected from 559 livestream viewers in a scenario-based survey were analyzed using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling (SEM) estimation and cross-validated using Bayesian SEM. The findings confirm the appraisal–emotion–action scheme and validate the role of arousal in mediating three persuasive factors and two behavioral approaches. Parasocial interaction intention was correlated with coolness, whereas congruence and mind perception were important antecedents of viewers’ urge to buy impulsively. Furthermore, mindset had important moderating effects on arousal and parasocial interaction intention toward impulsive urges. This study extends the research on influencer marketing and livestream shopping. It also apprises marketing and retailing managers of the importance of nurturing an AI workforce and sheds light on IS management practice for potential industry opportunities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Information Systems Frontiers,26,5,1803-1834,,10.1007/s10796-023-10425-2,,#4780,Zhang 2024,,,0
Artificial Authorship and Judicial Opinions,"Re, R.M.","Generative Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) is already beginning to alter legal practice. If optimistic forecasts prove warranted, how might this technology transform judicial opinions—a genre often viewed as central to the law? This Symposium Essay attempts to answer that predictive question, which sheds light on present realities. In brief, the provision of opinions will become cheaper and, relatedly, more widely and evenly supplied. Judicial writings will often be zestier, more diverse, and less deliberative. And as the legal system’s economy of persuasive ability is disrupted, courts will engage in a sort of arms race with the public: judges will use artificially enhanced rhetoric to promote their own legitimacy, and the public will become more cynical to avoid being fooled. Paradoxically, a surfeit of persuasive rhetoric could render legal reasoning itself obsolete. In response to these developments, some courts may disallow AI writing tools so that they can continue to claim the authority that flows from authorship. Potential stakes thus include both the fate of legal reason and the future of human participation in the legal system. © 2024 George Washington University.

Perceptions and expectations of an artificially intelligent physical activity digital assistant — A focus group study,"Vandelanotte, C.; Hodgetts, D.; Peris, D.L.I.H.K.; Karki, A.; Maher, C.; Imam, T.; Rashid, M.; To, Q.; Trost, S.","Artificially intelligent physical activity digital assistants that use the full spectrum of machine learning capabilities have not yet been developed and examined. This study aimed to explore potential users' perceptions and expectations of using such a digital assistant. Six 90-min online focus group meetings (n = 45 adults) were conducted. Meetings were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Participants embraced the idea of a ‘digital assistant’ providing physical activity support. Participants indicated they would like to receive notifications from the digital assistant, but did not agree on the number, timing, tone and content of notifications. Likewise, they indicated that the digital assistant's personality and appearance should be customisable. Participants understood the need to provide information to the digital assistant to allow for personalisation, but varied greatly in the extent of information that they were willing to provide. Privacy issues aside, participants embraced the idea of using artificial intelligence or machine learning in return for a more functional and personal digital assistant. In sum, participants were ready for an artificially intelligent physical activity digital assistant but emphasised a need to personalise or customise nearly every feature of the application. This poses challenges in terms of cost and complexity of developing the application. © 2024 The Author(s).

Radiomics features for the discrimination of tuberculomas from high grade gliomas and metastasis: a multimodal study,"Indoria, A.; Kulanthaivelu, K.; Prasad, C.; Srinivas, D.; Rao, S.; Sinha, N.; Potluri, V.; Netravathi, M.; Nalini, A.; Saini, J.","Background: Tuberculomas are prevalent in developing countries and demonstrate variable signals on MRI resulting in the overlap of the conventional imaging phenotype with other entities including glioma and brain metastasis. An accurate MRI diagnosis is important for the early institution of anti-tubercular therapy, decreased patient morbidity, mortality, and prevents unnecessary neurosurgical excision. This study aims to assess the potential of radiomics features of regular contrast images including T1W, T2W, T2W FLAIR, T1W post contrast images, and ADC maps, to differentiate between tuberculomas, high-grade-gliomas and metastasis, the commonest intra parenchymal mass lesions encountered in the clinical practice. Methods: This retrospective study includes 185 subjects. Images were resampled, co-registered, skull-stripped, and zscore-normalized. Automated lesion segmentation was performed followed by radiomics feature extraction, train-test split, and features reduction. All machine learning algorithms that natively support multiclass classification were trained and assessed on features extracted from individual modalities as well as combined modalities. Model explainability of the best performing model was calculated using the summary plot obtained by SHAP values. Results: Extra tree classifier trained on the features from ADC maps was the best classifier for the discrimination of tuberculoma from high-grade-glioma and metastasis with AUC-score of 0.96, accuracy-score of 0.923, Brier-score of 0.23. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that radiomics features are effective in discriminating between tuberculoma, metastasis, and high-grade-glioma with notable accuracy and AUC scores. Features extracted from the ADC maps surfaced as the most robust predictors of the target variable. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Neuroradiology,66,11,1979-1992,,10.1007/s00234-024-03435-7,,#4783,Indoria 2024,,,0
Feature Selection for Physical Activity Prediction Using Ecological Momentary Assessments to Personalize Intervention Timing: Longitudinal Observational Study,"Kumar, D.; Haag, D.; Blechert, J.; Niebauer, J.; Smeddinck, J.D.","Background: There has been a surge in the development of apps that aim to improve health, physical activity (PA), and well-being through behavior change. These apps often focus on creating a long-term and sustainable impact on the user. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that are based on passive sensing of the user’s current context (eg, via smartphones and wearables) have been devised to enhance the effectiveness of these apps and foster PA. JITAIs aim to provide personalized support and interventions such as encouraging messages in a context-aware manner. However, the limited range of passive sensing capabilities often make it challenging to determine the timing and context for delivering well-accepted and effective interventions. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can provide personal context by directly capturing user assessments (eg, moods and emotions). Thus, EMA might be a useful complement to passive sensing in determining when JITAIs are triggered. However, extensive EMA schedules need to be scrutinized, as they can increase user burden. Objective: The aim of the study was to use machine learning to balance the feature set size of EMA questions with the prediction accuracy regarding of enacting PA. Methods: A total of 43 healthy participants (aged 19‐67 years) completed 4 EMA surveys daily over 3 weeks. These surveys prospectively assessed various states, including both motivational and volitional variables related to PA preparation (eg, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and perceived barriers) alongside stress and mood or emotions. PA enactment was assessed retrospectively via EMA and served as the outcome variable. Results: The best-performing machine learning models predicted PA engagement with a mean area under the curve score of 0.87 (SD 0.02) in 5-fold cross-validation and 0.87 on the test set. Particularly strong predictors included self-efficacy, stress, planning, and perceived barriers, indicating that a small set of EMA predictors can yield accurate PA prediction for these participants. Conclusions: A small set of EMA-based features like self-efficacy, stress, planning, and perceived barriers can be enough to predict PA reasonably well and can thus be used to meaningfully tailor JITAIs such as sending well-timed and context-aware support messages. © Devender Kumar, David Haag, Jens Blechert, Josef Niebauer, Jan David Smeddinck.",2025,,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,13,,,,10.2196/57255,,#4784,Kumar 2025,,,0
"Mirror, mirror on the screen, “Wherein can I find me?” – On the sublime qualities of AI recommendation systems, algorithm conformity, and the else","den Hond, F.; Vesa, M.","Algorithmic persuasion is a mode of organizing that happens through inducing experiences that covertly seek to influence behavior by presenting an ongoing stream of affective recommendations. This essay advances the thesis that this mode of algorithmic organizing has the capacity to affect individuals’ sense of their self and explores how and why this may happen. It suggests that individuals may be susceptible to experiencing AI recommendation systems as sublime. Their sublime qualities give normative force to their recommendations and, through them, appeal to one’s affective drives, fears, and hopes, revealing who or what one is or may become. This subjecting of one’s self to these recommendations warrants two critical observations: a behavioral preference we call “people-like-you” and the emergence of “algorithm conformity” as an organizing force. Yet, there can be epistemic corruption in the recommendations. This epistemic corruption is the else, whose experience can evoke uncanny feelings and carries with it the possibility to break the spell of the sublime and to escape and resist algorithm conformity. But can such experiences, individual and dispersed, give rise to actions of collective resistance in a world of algorithmic capitalism? © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,,Organization,,,,,10.1177/13505084251331396,,#4785,denHond 2025,,,0
Relationship between teacher's ability model and students' behavior based on emotion-behavior relevance theory and artificial intelligence technology under the background of curriculum ideological and political education,"Zhao, C.; Yu, J.","Purpose: This paper aims to fully understand the relationship between students' classroom emotions and teachers' behaviors in the teaching environment, provide personalized teaching support, stimulate teachers' motivation, and enhance the emotional connection between teachers and students. This paper designs a teacher's ability model based on emotion-behavior relevance theory and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Methods: Firstly, this paper expounds on the integration of emotion-behavior relevance theory, AI, and teacher's ability model under the background of ideological and political education. Subsequently, the artificial neural network (ANN) model is deeply analyzed in relation to the development of psychology and AI technology. Guided by the theory of emotion-behavior relevance, an ANN model is used to optimize the classroom emotion recognition module in the teacher's ability model. The accuracy of the optimized teacher's ability model in recognizing attention and resistance is verified by experiments. The relationship between the teacher's classroom emotions, students' classroom behavior, and the teacher's teaching ability is analyzed. Results: The experimental results show that the optimized model can effectively identify students' classroom emotions, and the accuracy of identifying attention and resistance reaches 93.6 % and 92 %, respectively, significantly exceeding the traditional model. For other emotions, the accuracy of the experimental group ranges from 80.6 % to 87.9 %, while that of the control group is only 61.1 %. The optimized model shows a better effect on the emotional recognition of multiple students. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed optimization model. In addition, by analyzing teachers' emotions in real classroom videos, people can observe that teachers' psychological emotions and behaviors change with the changes in students' classroom emotions. Under the students' positive emotions, teachers scored high in psychological emotions, behaviors, and teaching achievements, with the lowest scores of 87, 80, and 85, respectively. Under students' negative emotions, teachers' related scores are low, with the highest scores of 40, 40, and 42. This highlights the critical influence of the emotional attitude and values of the main characters on teachers' teaching ability in the classroom environment from the psychological perspective. Conclusion: Students' positive emotions, such as concentration and devotion, will arouse teachers' satisfaction and happiness, motivate them to teach more diligently, and improve the teaching effect. On the contrary, students' negative emotions, such as resistance and doubt, may cause teachers to feel depressed and discouraged. This proves the importance and effectiveness of integrating the emotion-behavior relevance theory into teaching. Students' emotions impact teachers' psychological emotions and behaviors and affect the teaching effect. In this case, teachers need to use their emotional adjustment ability to adjust their feelings in time to better guide students and improve teaching efficiency. This paper provides valuable insights for optimizing the teacher's ability model. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.",2024,,Learning and Motivation,88,,,,10.1016/j.lmot.2024.102040,,#4787,Zhao 2024,,,0

Promoting Health Literacy With Human-in-the-Loop Video Understandability Classification of YouTube Videos: Development and Evaluation Study,"Liu, X.; Susarla, A.; Padman, R.","Background: An estimated 93% of adults in the United States access the internet, with up to 80% looking for health information. However, only 12% of US adults are proficient enough in health literacy to interpret health information and make informed health care decisions meaningfully. With the vast amount of health information available in multimedia formats on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, there is an urgent need and a unique opportunity to design an automated approach to curate online health information using multiple criteria to meet the health literacy needs of a diverse population. Objective: This study aimed to develop an automated approach to assessing the understandability of patient educational videos according to the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) guidelines and evaluating the impact of video understandability on viewer engagement. We also offer insights for content creators and health care organizations on how to improve engagement with these educational videos on user-generated content platforms. Methods: We developed a human-in-the-loop, augmented intelligence approach that explicitly focused on the human-algorithm interaction, combining PEMAT-based patient education constructs mapped to features extracted from the videos, annotations of the videos by domain experts, and cotraining methods from machine learning to assess the understandability of videos on diabetes and classify them. We further examined the impact of understandability on several dimensions of viewer engagement with the videos. Results: We collected 9873 YouTube videos on diabetes using search keywords extracted from a patient-oriented forum and reviewed by a medical expert. Our machine learning methods achieved a weighted precision of 0.84, a weighted recall of 0.79, and an F1-score of 0.81 in classifying video understandability and could effectively identify patient educational videos that medical experts would like to recommend for patients. Videos rated as highly understandable had an average higher view count (average treatment effect [ATE]=2.55; P<.001), like count (ATE=2.95; P<.001), and comment count (ATE=3.10; P<.001) than less understandable videos. In addition, in a user study, 4 medical experts recommended 72% (144/200) of the top 10 videos ranked by understandability compared to 40% (80/200) of the top 10 videos ranked by YouTube’s default algorithm for 20 ramdomly selected search keywords. Conclusions: We developed a human-in-the-loop, scalable algorithm to assess the understandability of health information on YouTube. Our method optimally combines expert input with algorithmic support, enhancing engagement and aiding medical experts in recommending educational content. This solution also guides health care organizations in creating effective patient education materials for underserved health topics. ©Xiao Liu, Anjana Susarla, Rema Padman.",2025,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,27,,,,10.2196/56080,,#4790,Liu 2025,,,0
They misused me! Digital literacy’s dual role in AI marketing manipulation and unethical young consumer behavior,"Qadri, U.A.; Moustafa, A.M.A.; Abd Ghani, M.","Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven marketing has transformed the landscape of consumer interactions, but it also raises ethical concerns regarding perceived manipulation and subsequent unethical young consumer behavior. This study aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of AI-driven marketing on unethical young consumer behavior, with digital literacy as a moderating variable. The authors introduce and conceptualize a digital literacy construct that influences how young consumers perceive and react to manipulative AI-driven marketing tactics. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM), this research explores how digital literacy influences the reception of AI-driven marketing and moderates the effects of perceived manipulative tactics. This study adopts a three-wave, time-lagged survey method among young consumers in urban Pakistan, integrating measures of AI-driven marketing techniques, perceived manipulation, digital literacy and unethical consumer behavior. Findings: The results reveal that perceived manipulation mediates the relationship between AI-driven marketing and unethical young consumer behavior. Digital literacy significantly moderates this effect, indicating that higher digital literacy levels can mitigate the negative impacts of perceived manipulation. Conversely, lower digital literacy amplifies the negative impacts of perceived manipulation. Practical implications: The findings underscore the need for marketers to foster transparency and ethical practices in AI-driven strategies. Enhancing consumer digital literacy can serve as a protective factor against unethical marketing practices. Originality/value: This study contributes to the understanding of digital literacy’s protective role against unethical AI-driven marketing practices.

11th Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems (IntRS’24),"Brusilovsky, P.; de Gemmis, M.; Felfernig, A.; Polignano, M.; Semeraro, G.; Willemsen, M.C.","The primary goal of Recommender Systems is to suggest the most suitable items to a user, aligning them with the user’s interests and needs. RSs are essential for modern e-commerce, helping users discover content and products by predicting suitable items based on their past behavior. However, their success isn’t just about advanced algorithms. The design of the user interface and a good integration with the human decision-making process are equally crucial. A well-designed interface enhances the user experience and makes recommendations more effective, while a poor interface can lead to frustration. Recognizing this limitation, recent trends in Recommender Systems (RSs) are increasingly focusing on integrating Symbiotic Human-Machine Decision-Making models. These models aim to offer users a dynamic and persuasive interface that helps them better understand and engage with recommendations. This shift is a crucial step toward developing recommender systems that truly connect with users and offer a more enjoyable, trustworthy, explainable, and user-friendly experience. Although early efforts concentrated on creating systems that could proactively predict user preferences and needs, modern RSs also emphasize the importance of providing users with control and transparency over their recommendations. Finding the right balance between proactivity and user control is essential to ensure that the system supports users without being too intrusive, thus improving their overall satisfaction. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into recommender systems, the importance of user-centric interfaces and a deep understanding of decision-making becomes even more critical. Effective integration of LLMs requires interfaces that are both visually and cognitively engaging. These aspects are the main discussion topics of the Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems at RecSys’24. In this summary, we introduce the motivation and perspective of the workshop, review its history, and discuss the most critical issues that deserve attention for future research directions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,,RecSys 2024 - Proceedings of the 18th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,,,1253-1257,,10.1145/3640457.3687098,,#4794,Brusilovsky 2024,,,0

Despite its importance, understanding optimal feedback is challenging due to the difficulty of capturing and categorizing feedback at scale. We propose a Human-AI Collaborative Refinement Process that uses unsupervised machine learning (Topic Modeling) with human refinement to discover feedback categories from surgical transcripts. Our discovered categories are rated highly for clinical clarity and are relevant to practice, including topics like “Handling and Positioning of (tissue)” and “(Tissue) Layer Depth Assessment and Correction [during tissue dissection].” These AI-generated topics significantly enhance predictions of trainee behavioral change, providing insights beyond traditional manual categorization. For example, feedback on “Handling Bleeding” is linked to improved behavioral change.

Innovative application of artificial intelligence in a multi-dimensional communication research analysis: a critical review,"Asif, M.; Gouqing, Z.","Artificial intelligence (AI) imitates the human brain’s capacity for problem-solving and making decisions by using computers and other devices. People engage with artificial intelligence-enabled products like virtual agents, social bots, and language-generation software, to name a few. The paradigms of communication theory, which have historically put a significant focus on human-to-human communication, do not easily match these gadgets. AI in multidimensional touch is the subject of this review article, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the most recent research published in the field of AI, specifically related to communication. Additionally, we considered several theories and models (communication theory, AI-based persuasion theory, social exchange theory, Frames of mind, Neural network model, L-LDA model, and Routine model) to explain a complex phenomenon and to create a conceptual framework that is appropriate for this goal and a voluntary relationship between two or more people that lasts for an extended period. Communication and media studies focus on human–machine communication (HMC), a rapidly developing research area.

Trust in maps: what we know and what we need to know,"Prestby, T.J.","Maps have served as authoritative and trustworthy sources of geospatial information for years. However, maps are increasingly being wielded to spread misinformation due to the democratization of mapmaking, advances in AI, and the emergence of post-truth politics. Trust plays a fundamental role in the spread of misinformation, but our understanding of trust in the context of maps is limited. In this paper, I examine the methodologies employed by empirical studies on trust in maps and synthesize the major findings of said studies. Most of the reviewed studies were experiments that utilized single-item self-reporting Likert-type measures to capture trust. I organized the findings of the studies into six major themes including source, metadata, transparency, uncertainty, design, and information modality. Additionally, I present a research agenda based on the findings and limitations of existing works. This agenda highlights methodological challenges to studying trust in maps and proposes opportunities in the form of research questions. © 2023 The Author(s).

A WISER intervention to combat the influence of misinformation on social media,"Schneider, A.B.; Stornelli, J.; Chugani, S.; Luchs, M.G.; Vu, T.; Kaur, T.; Mick, D.G.","Purpose: Misinformation is a major threat to individual, organizational and societal well-being. Combating it requires change on multiple levels. The purpose of this paper is to describe two co-created initiatives designed to holistically reduce the prevalence and effects of misinformation on social media. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a co-creation approach by convening a stakeholder group including social media, advertising, artificial intelligence and advocacy leaders. The authors also engaged social media users to collectively generate, test and implement an anti-misinformation strategy. These stakeholders shaped the development of the tools described in this paper. Findings: First, the authors present a Social Media Ecosystem Map and Incentive Analysis that achieve impact by documenting avenues for action. Second, the authors illustrate impact at the user level by developing and disseminating the WISER framework, which delivers an implementable and memorable anti-misinformation strategy. Research limitations/implications: Strategies tailored to the needs and characteristics of stakeholders are most likely to be persuasive. The discoveries and conclusions incorporate the contexts of the stakeholders with whom the authors collaborated. Future work will reveal recommendations for a broader audience. Practical implications: The Social Media Ecosystem Map, Incentive Analysis and WISER framework represent promising foundations to spark novel insights and actions for ways to be WISER about information on social media. Originality/value: Impact is often limited because strategies are developed in academic, corporate or policy silos.

Knowledge of automated journalism moderates evaluations of algorithmically generated news,"Jang, W.; Kwak, D.H.; Bucy, E.","Drawing on propositions from the HAII-TIME (Human–artificial intelligence [AI] Interaction and the Theory of Interactive Media Effects) and Persuasion Knowledge Model, this study examines how knowledge of automated journalism (AJ) moderates the evaluation of algorithmically generated news. Experiment 1 demonstrates the utility of process-related knowledge in user evaluations of agency: individuals with little knowledge of AJ prefer attributions of human authorship over news stories attributed to algorithms, whereas individuals with high AJ knowledge have an equal or stronger preference for news that is described as algorithmically generated. Experiment 2 conditions these effects to show how prior characterizations of AJ—whether more machine- or human-like—shape evaluations of algorithmically generated news contingent on user age and knowledge level. Effects are found for differing age groups at lower levels of AJ knowledge, where machine-like characterizations enhance evaluations of algorithmically generated news for younger users but ascribing human-like traits enhances evaluations of automated news for older users. © The Author(s) 2022.",2024,,New Media and Society,26,10,5898-5922,,10.1177/14614448221142534,,#4808,Jang 2024,,,0
Conceptualizing generative AI as style engines: Application archetypes and implications,"Riemer, K.; Peter, S.","The rise of generative AI has brought with it a surprising paradox: systems that excel at tasks once thought to be uniquely human, like fluent conversation or persuasive writing, while simultaneously failing to meet traditional expectations of computing, in terms of reliability, accuracy, and veracity (e.g., given the various issues with so-called ‘hallucinations’). We argue that, when generative AI is seen through a traditional computing lens, its development focuses on optimizing for traditional computing traits that remain in principle unattainable. This risks backgrounding what is most novel and defining about it. As probabilistic technologies, generative AIs do not store, in any traditional sense, any data or content. Rather, essential features of training data become encoded in deep neural networks as patterns, that become practically available as styles. We discuss what happens when the distinction between objects and their appearance dissolves and all aspects of images or text become understood as styles, accessible for exploration and creative combination and generation. For example, defining visual qualities of entities like ‘chair’ or ‘cat’ become available as ‘chair-ness’ or ‘cat-ness’ for creative image generation. We argue that, when understood as style engines, unique generative AI capabilities become conceptualized as complementing traditional computing ones. This will aid both computing practitioners and information systems researchers in reconciling and integrating generative AI into the traditional IS landscape. Our conceptualization leads us to propose four archetypes of generative AI application and use, and to highlight future avenues for information systems research made visible by this conceptualization, as well as implications for practice and policymaking. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,International Journal of Information Management,79,,,,10.1016/j.ijinfomgt.2024.102824,,#4809,Riemer 2024,,,0
"Lights, camera, engagement! The role of personalized video as a marketing strategy in capturing consumer attention","Dennis, M.; Kizer, T.H.","Personalized video marketing is increasingly leveraged as advertisers employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to tailor content to target audiences. Grounded in self-reference theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this study examines the impact of video personalization on consumer engagement. Partnering with Vidyard, a video hosting platform, we analyzed historical video data to assess how personalized content influences persuasion pathways. Using a mixed-methods approach, we identified significant differences in engagement and elaboration between personalized and non-personalized videos. Findings indicate that personalized videos yield higher message downloads, rewatch likelihood, and click-through rates, aligning with central processing. Additionally, open-ended surveys from firms using personalized video identified three key benefits: increased engagement, heightened viewer attention, and competitive differentiation.

Can LLMs Reason Like Humans? Assessing Theory of Mind Reasoning in LLMs for Open-Ended Questions,"Amirizaniani, M.; Martin, E.; Sivachenko, M.; Mashhadi, A.; Shah, C.","Theory of mind (ToM) reasoning involves understanding that others have intentions, emotions, and thoughts, which is crucial for regulating one's reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation, they still face challenges with ToM reasoning, especially in open-ended questions. Despite advancements, the extent to which LLMs truly understand ToM reasoning and how closely it aligns with human ToM reasoning remains inadequately explored in open-ended scenarios. Motivated by this gap, we assess the abilities of LLMs to perceive and integrate human intentions and emotions into their ToM reasoning processes within open-ended questions. Our study utilizes posts from Reddit's ChangeMyView platform, which demands nuanced social reasoning to craft persuasive responses. Our analysis, comparing semantic similarity and lexical overlap metrics between responses generated by humans and LLMs, reveals clear disparities in ToM reasoning capabilities in open-ended questions, with even the most advanced models showing notable limitations. To enhance LLM capabilities, we implement a prompt tuning method that incorporates human intentions and emotions, resulting in improvements in ToM reasoning performance. However, despite these improvements, the enhancement still falls short of fully achieving human-like reasoning. This research highlights the deficiencies in LLMs' social reasoning and demonstrates how integrating human intentions and emotions can boost their effectiveness.  © 2024 Owner/Author.",2024,,"International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings",,,34-44,,10.1145/3627673.3679832,,#4812,Amirizaniani 2024,,,0

Power Dynamics and Autonomy: Engaging Employees Around the Design of Autonomous Agents,"Ostrowski, A.K.; Gunther, L.; Dipaola, D.; Breazeal, C.","Power dynamics through the lens of autonomy in human-robot interaction (HRI) has largely been considered through the robot's persuasion and its impact on users. Power found in hierarchies and relationships between users and robots has been less investigated. Through a co-design workshop with industry employees, we investigate how employees design autonomous agents (AA) for a risk management and safety task, focusing on the designed agent interactions and personalities (robots and chatbots). The qualitative analysis of the storyboards and personalities revealed how employees designed autonomy and power dynamics between the workers and AAs, mirroring power dynamics in social systems. These results revealed how power dynamics are interconnected with anthropomorphization of AAs, demonstrating what has been previously theorized by HRI scholars. Overall, this work considers autonomy and power in design representations and unifies varying conceptualizations of power in HRI to support a holistic perspective of how power is explored through HRI design. © 2025 IEEE.",2025,,ACM/IEEE International Conference on Human-Robot Interaction,,,909-918,,10.1109/HRI61500.2025.10974065,,#4815,Ostrowski 2025,,,0

AI-induced hyper-learning in humans,"Glickman, M.; Sharot, T.","Humans evolved to learn from one another. Today, however, learning opportunities often emerge from interactions with AI systems. Here, we argue that learning from AI systems resembles learning from other humans, but may be faster and more efficient. Such ‘hyper learning’ can occur because AI: (i) provides a high signal-to-noise ratio that facilitates learning, (ii) has greater data processing ability, enabling it to generate persuasive arguments, and (iii) is perceived (in some domains) to have superior knowledge compared to humans. As a result, humans more quickly adopt biases from AI, are often more easily persuaded by AI, and exhibit novel problem-solving strategies after interacting with AI. Greater awareness of AI's influences is needed to mitigate the potential negative outcomes of human-AI interactions. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Current Opinion in Psychology,60,,,,10.1016/j.copsyc.2024.101900,,#4818,Glickman 2024,,,0
Digital Health Interventions for Adolescents with Long-Term Health Conditions in South Africa: A Scoping Review,"Crowley, T.; Tokwe, L.; Weyers, L.; Francis, R.; Petinger, C.","Adolescents with long-term health conditions may benefit from digital health interventions (DHIs) to support self-management. The study aimed to map the current research on DHIs for adolescents with long-term conditions in South Africa, focusing on the types of interventions, targeted chronic conditions, and reported outcomes. The scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Searches were conducted in electronic databases such as EBSCOHost (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Ultimate, and APA PSycArticles), Wiley Online Library, and PubMed for articles published between 2014 and 2024.

Nine studies were included in the analysis, focusing primarily on HIV, depression/anxiety, and diabetes. Most interventions utilized WhatsApp, SMS, or social media to provide peer or healthcare worker support. Process outcomes like acceptability and feasibility dominated, with limited data on effectiveness. DHIs show potential for supporting adolescent health but cover a limited number of long-term health conditions and face barriers to effective implementation.

Achieving Decarbonization and Employee Well-Being in Urban Business Districts: The Nihonbashi Initiative,"Takahashi, H.; Toyokawa, M.; Kimura, Y.; Yamagata, Y.","In recent years, Japanese companies and municipalities have increasingly recognized the importance of urban decarbonization. Urban areas, with their concentration of businesses, must consider not only decarbonization but also the well-being of the people working there. It is particularly important for business leaders to balance decarbonization efforts with employee well-being. This project aims to create scenarios that achieve both decarbonization and well-being in Nihonbashi, a central business district in Tokyo. The main focus is on long-term forecasting and management of energy demand using integrated simulation technology with an urban digital twin and developing scenarios that contribute to improving the overall well-being of employees. Project activities include predicting and visualizing hourly energy demand for buildings within the area and assessing the effects of various decarbonization options. One decarbonization option involves implementing a system to transmit locally generated renewable energy to Nihonbashi and validating it with predictive models. By collaborating with building owners to advance energy management, the project has identified the potential to achieve approximately 10% energy savings. In addition, the project will also work to improve employee well-being by implementing a chatbot program that will educate employees about their company's decarbonization activities and encourage behavior change to increase their sense of contribution. The project aims to enhance sustainable urban development and comfort in the office area and is an important step in a larger decarbonization initiative that will be implemented in partnership with building owners in the Nihonbashi area. Ultimately, the project aims to improve energy efficiency and overall community well-being and serve as a model for future urban sustainability. © 2025, Scanditale AB.

A 7-point evidence-based care discharge protocol for patients hospitalized for exacerbation of COPD: consensus strategy and expert recommendation,"Salvi, S.; Ghorpade, D.; Nair, S.; Pinto, L.; Singh, A.K.; Venugopal, K.; Dhar, R.; Talwar, D.; Koul, P.; Prabhudesai, P.","Acute exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are an important event in the life of a COPD patient as it causes significant deterioration of physical, mental, and social health, hastens disease progression, increases the risk of dying and causes a huge economic loss. Preventing ECOPD is therefore one of the most important goals in the management of COPD. Before the patient is discharged after hospitalization for ECOPD, it is crucial to offer an evidence-based care bundle protocol that will help minimize the future risk of readmissions and death. To develop the content of this quality care bundle, an Expert Working Group was formed, which performed a systematic review of literature, brainstormed, and debated on key clinical issues before arriving at a consensus strategy that could help physicians achieve this goal. A 7-point consensus strategy was prepared, which included: (1) enhancing awareness and seriousness of ECOPD, (2) identifying patients at risk for future exacerbations, (3) optimizing pharmacologic treatment of COPD, (4) identifying and treating comorbidities, (5) preventing bacterial and viral infections, (6) pulmonary rehabilitation, and (7) palliative care.

The Changing Behavior of the European Credit Default Swap Spreads During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Bayesian Network Analysis,"Cinicioglu, E.N.; Huyugüzel Kışla, G.; Önder, A.Ö.; Muradoğlu, Y.G.","The level of financial risk spread out to the world during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that none of the countries are immune to financial uncertainty and the vast changes it brings to economic stability. The contagiousness of sovereign risk is a result of the interdependent structure of countries’ financial networks. Yet the analysis of sovereign CDS risk spread using the network view is both new and limited. With this study, we want to use the network view to prove the interconnectedness of the financial systems in Europe and its effect on the spread of the risk throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study is threefold: First, using the Bayesian networks learned from the daily CDS values of 17 European Union countries, we demonstrate the dependent network structure of countries and the movement of the sovereign risk over this network with a cascading behavior. Second, we explore how the probabilistic dependency structure changes over the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to alterations on the behavior of the sovereign risk spread. The previous studies on the sovereign risk spread during the COVID-19 pandemic employs the data over the whole period of the pandemic. However, during the pandemic the behavior of the spread was changing, and to capture that change the consideration of shorter intervals becomes crucial. Therefore, in this study, the COVID-19 crisis period from December 2019 until February 2021 is divided into five phases of 3-month time intervals. As the third and last objective, this study intends to be a roadmap for policy makers as well as for researchers to understand the true nature and connectedness of sovereign risk transmissions. For that purpose, we provide a benchmark procedure for the evaluation of the sovereign risk of countries using Bayesian networks which involves a comprehensive analysis involving several steps conducted on each of the learned Bayesian networks for the different phases of the pandemic. In terms of policy implications, this study aims to be helpful for investors that want to diversify sovereign risk in their bond portfolios and be explanatory for the changing behavior of the risk spread during crisis periods. Moreover, this study exemplifies the use of artificial intelligence methods to understand the working mechanism of economic systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Computational Economics,63,3,1213-1254,,10.1007/s10614-023-10489-x,,#4832,Cinicioglu 2024,,,0
Time for a paradigm change: Problems with the financial industry's approach to operational risk,"Butler, T.; Brooks, R.","Organizational and risk cultures in the financial industry are argued to be the root cause of banking problems. It is concerning that financial regulators and practitioners still consider the industry to be seriously fragile in several respects, particularly to operational risks and risks associated with digital transformation and innovation—not that the risks of organizational misconduct have disappeared. The rescue of Credit Suisse in 2023 confirms this. This paper employs extant theories of organizational culture, learning, and action to critically evaluate the existing risk paradigm in banking and to highlight its deficiencies, which practitioners can only address by questioning the flawed assumptions and dysfunctional values and behaviors found to be endemic in banks. However, business and risk practitioners are also married to institutional approaches that focus on assessing risk and measuring historical losses to allocate regulatory capital, rather than forward-looking approaches to measure and manage risk. This requires a paradigm change. This paper presents a novel risk measurement and accounting methodology, Risk Accounting, to help underpin such change. Risk accounting measures risk exposure in quantitative and qualitative terms and can be implemented using an AI-enabled digital architecture that could solve endemic problems with risk data aggregation and analysis. Significantly, risk accounting enables a financial value to be placed on risk exposures at a granular level. This level of transparency provides an incentive to change behaviors in banks and support cultural change while providing a basis for a paradigm change in the way operational risk is managed. © 2023 The Authors.

Illusory Arguments by Artificial Agents: Pernicious Legacy of the Sophists,"Clark, M.H.; Bringsjord, S.","To diagnose someone’s reasoning today as “sophistry” is to say that this reasoning is at once persuasive (at least to a significant degree) and logically invalid. We begin by explaining that, despite some recent scholarly arguments to the contrary, the understanding of ‘sophistry’ and ‘sophistic’ underlying such a lay diagnosis is in fact firmly in line with the hallmarks of reasoning proffered by the ancient sophists themselves. Next, we supply a rigorous but readable definition of what constitutes sophistic reasoning (=sophistry). We then discuss “artificial” sophistry: the articulation of sophistic reasoning facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and promulgated in our increasingly digital world. Next, we present, economically, a particular kind of artificial sophistry, one embodied by an artificial agent: the lying machine. Afterward, we respond to some anticipated objections.

Transforming information exchanges into personal conversations provides a creative method for analyzing how relations are co-constructed in the granular processes of interaction, through which mutual intelligibility is built, meaning about the world is made, and identities are formed. This critical analysis extends methods for human–machine communication studies and elaborates notions of algorithmic identity. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,New Media and Society,26,9,5059-5080,,10.1177/14614448241251800,,#4836,Markham 2024,,,0
Evaluating the Interplay between Trajectory Segmentation and Mode Inference Error,"Kosmacher, G.; Shankari, K.","Travel behavior changes are essential to transportation decarbonization. Travel diaries, consisting of sequences of trips between places, are typically used to instrument human travel behavior. However, these diaries are only as accurate as the underlying methods used to construct them. Travel diary algorithms have been a popular research topic since the advent of Global Positioning System tracking surveys. These algorithms have typically been validated using prompted recall of presegmented trips, thus disregarding the continuity of mode inference. Phone operating systems have adopted battery-conserving techniques, but the resulting data collection errors have not been studied extensively. We introduce a framework to evaluate the accuracy of trip length computations and mode inference by analyzing continuous mode-segmented trajectories for groups of trips. We then use the framework to identify the input data quality and the impact of postprocessing. Our primary inputs to this evaluation are MobilityNet, a public dataset containing information from three artificial timelines covering 15 different travel modes, and sample open-source travel diary creation algorithms from the OpenPATH project. Our framework concretely shows that the variance of the distance error drops from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) (Android, iOS) after postprocessing. Similarly, the weighted F-scores for mode inference increase from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) (iOS, Android) between random forest and geographic information system-based models. We hope that this standardized method will be adapted to evaluate other, potentially proprietary, travel diary algorithms. The results can be used to understand and improve the state of the art in the travel diary creation field. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.",2024,,Transportation Research Record,2678,7,32-49,,10.1177/03611981231208154,,#4837,Kosmacher 2024,,,0
WHO NEEDS BIG DATA ETHICS: OPINIONS OF IT DEVELOPERS AND LEADS ON THE NEED TO CREATE A PROFESSIONAL CODE OF ETHICS,"Koval, E.A.; Ushkin, S.G.","Widespread digitalization affects not only technological processes, but also social norms and practices. Many decisions that significantly impact individuals and society are increasingly made based on big data analytics or delegated to artificial intelligence. In such conditions, IT specialists become new agents of power who influence society not through persuasion, but through the technologies being developed and implemented. This explains the increased interest in the beliefs and values of IT developers, as well as their ability to take moral responsibility for their professional decisions. The article presents the results of a twostage empirical study, consisting of indepth interviews (n = 8) and a targeted survey (n = 50). Analysis of these data showed that the community of IT specialists is fragmented and disunited. The need for ethical regulation of the professional activities in this group is not expressed, and ethics is perceived rather as a hindrance or an unnecessary addition to the legal means of regulating work with big data. Generally, IT leads are less interested in ethical regulation of work with big data than nonmanagerial personnel, which may be due to a commitment to the interests of companies focused on direct or indirect profit maximization. Despite the weakly expressed need for the development and implementation of a professional ethics code, big data experts made several valuable suggestions and comments regarding its structure and content and noted that it should primarily be aimed at ensuring the reliability of big data storage and the protection of personal data. © 2024 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM.

Enhancing COVID-19 Vaccination Awareness and Uptake in the Post-PHEIC Era: A Narrative Review of Physician-Level and System-Level Strategies,"See, K.C.","Following the World Health Organization’s declaration that the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), COVID-19 remains an ongoing threat to human health and healthcare systems. Vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the disease’s incidence, mitigating its severity, and limiting transmission, contributing to long-term public health resilience. However, incomplete vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy exist. This narrative review investigates strategies at the system and physician levels aimed at sustaining awareness and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in a post-PHEIC era. Through an examination of the existing literature, this review explores the effectiveness of diverse approaches utilized by healthcare systems and individual providers. These approaches address every component of the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy: confidence, complacency, constraints/convenience, calculation, and collective responsibility. Physician-level approaches include appropriate message framing, persuasive communication containing safety and personal/social benefit information, sharing of personal stories, creating a safe space for discussion, harnessing co-administration with annual influenza vaccines, and use of decision aids and visual messages. System-level approaches include messaging, mass media for health communication, on-site vaccine availability, pharmacist delivery, healthcare protocol integration, incentives, and chatbot use. © 2024 by the author.",2024,,Vaccines,12,9,,,10.3390/vaccines12091038,,#4839,See 2024,,,0
Machine Learning and the Work of the User,"Harper, R.; Randall, D.","This paper introduces the collection of the Journal on Machine Learning (ML) and the user. It provides a brief history of ML from the 1950’s through to the current time, sketching the nature of the kinds of precursor AI techniques used in such things as expert systems right the way through to the emergence of ML and its tool sets, including deep learning. It concludes with the ‘generative AI’ used in such ML technologies as PaLM and GPT-3. The history highlights key changes and developments in ML, the especial importance and limitations of deep learning, and the changing attitudes and expectations of users in an environment when ML can and often is oversold. The paper then explores the ways CSCW research has addressed the social context of organisational systems and how the same can apply for ML tools and techniques.

Caregiver's Evaluation of LLM-Generated Treatment Goals for Patients with Severe Mental Illnesses,"James, L.J.; Genga, L.; Montagne, B.; Hagenaars, M.; Van Gorp, P.","The potential of LLMs to generate context-specific content for psychiatric patients could possibly be used to support treatment. Patients diagnosed with Severe Mental Illnesses face a significant challenge in the realm of goal setting. Caregivers work closely with patients with SMI to establish treatment goals. However, most goals are often immeasurable, hindering their integration into mHealth. This is a missed opportunity since mHealth has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in tracking a patient's progress and help motivate patients to work on their goals using behavior change concepts like personalization and gamification.

Adaptive change: Emerging economy enterprises respond to the international business environment challenge,"Shi, J.","The technological and market containment of emerging economy enterprises (EEEs) from developed countries is becoming a great challenge for EEE development. In this context, how do EEEs respond to international business challenges and achieve continuous organizational innovation? This study proposes a process model of EEEs’ organizational adaptive change to achieve innovation using the case of Hikvision, a leading Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) enterprise. The results show that the adaptive change in EEEs is a dynamic process. The negative impact of international business environment challenges on enterprise development is the starting point for enterprises to adopt change behaviors. Through adaptive change in innovation strategy, innovation architecture and innovation systems, EEEs can break through technology blockades, overcome market crises and further weaken the negative impact of such challenges. This study constructs an adaptive change process model for EEEs and proposes strategic initiatives for EEEs with the help of a national innovation system (NIS), which has policy implications for EEE strategies and industrial policy design in emerging economies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Technovation,133,,,,10.1016/j.technovation.2024.102998,,#4844,Shi 2024,,,0
Artificial intelligence in Departments of Communication: A course proposal,"Connor, K.E.; Cali, D.D.","When communication and mass media faculty returned from a kind of exile that COVID-19 had inflicted on them, they were hit almost immediately with the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI). The fall semester of 2023 seemed to usher in a new means by which students would complete assignments that left faculty scratching their heads. They faced a new form of information retrieval that students (as well as faculty) were using that, at once, yielded more substantive prose while at the same time posed new questions about authorship, trust, reliability, bias and even personhood. The discipline of communication and media studies bears a particular responsibility to contemplate the massive change underway with the use of AI. Most of us in the field have dedicated our careers to considering the human-media-culture interface. Media ecologists, in particular, routinely explore how media shape culture, conscience and communication. Yet many of us have not known what to make of the phenomenon suddenly surging in academics and in all sectors of society. This article seeks to offer a framework, cultivated out of media ecological sensibilities, for critically examining implications of AI in the realm of communication. Specifically, we have designed a graduate course that takes up the major lines of inquiry into how AI challenges conventions and urges new paradigms in our discipline. Our article offers a course proposal that communication faculty can adopt to their curriculum. It consists of a sample course syllabus, recommended textbooks and YouTube videos, sample assignments, a review of major AI themes in scholarly and trade journals, a suggested media ecology tool for critical application (the Tetrad), and an extensive bibliography. The overall objective of our course proposal is to guide reflection on the implications of AI in various communication contexts and environments. © 2024 Intellect Ltd.",2024,,Explorations in Media Ecology,23,2,175-198,,10.1386/eme_00204_7,,#4845,Connor 2024,,,0
Rethinking Health Recommender Systems for Active Aging: An Autonomy-Based Ethical Analysis,"Tiribelli, S.; Calvaresi, D.","Health Recommender Systems are promising Articial-Intelligence-based tools endowing healthy lifestyles and therapy adherence in healthcare and medicine. Among the most supported areas, it is worth mentioning active aging. However, current HRS supporting AA raise ethical challenges that still need to be properly formalized and explored. This study proposes to rethink HRS for AA through an autonomy-based ethical analysis. In particular, a brief overview of the HRS’ technical aspects allows us to shed light on the ethical risks and challenges they might raise on individuals’ well-being as they age. Moreover, the study proposes a categorization, understanding, and possible preventive/mitigation actions for the elicited risks and challenges through rethinking the AI ethics core principle of autonomy. Finally, elaborating on autonomy-related ethical theories, the paper proposes an autonomy-based ethical framework and how it can foster the development of autonomy-enabling HRS for AA. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,Science and Engineering Ethics,30,3,,,10.1007/s11948-024-00479-z,,#4846,Tiribelli 2024,,,0
Looking for a better fit? An Incremental Learning Multimodal Object Referencing Framework adapting to Individual Drivers,"Gomaa, A.; Reyes, G.; Feld, M.; Krüger, A.","The rapid advancement of the automotive industry towards automated and semi-automated vehicles has rendered traditional methods of vehicle interaction, such as touch-based and voice command systems, inadequate for a widening range of non-driving related tasks, such as referencing objects outside of the vehicle. Consequently, research has shifted toward gestural input (e.g., hand, gaze, and head pose gestures) as a more suitable mode of interaction during driving. However, due to the dynamic nature of driving and individual variation, there are significant differences in drivers' gestural input performance. While, in theory, this inherent variability could be moderated by substantial data-driven machine learning models, prevalent methodologies lean towards constrained, single-instance trained models for object referencing. These models show a limited capacity to continuously adapt to the divergent behaviors of individual drivers and the variety of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose IcRegress, a novel regression-based incremental learning approach that adapts to changing behavior and the unique characteristics of drivers engaged in the dual task of driving and referencing objects. We suggest a more personalized and adaptable solution for multimodal gestural interfaces, employing continuous lifelong learning to enhance driver experience, safety, and convenience. Our approach was evaluated using an outside-the-vehicle object referencing use case, highlighting the superiority of the incremental learning models adapted over a single trained model across various driver traits such as handedness, driving experience, and numerous driving conditions.

Healthcare professional and commissioners’ perspectives on the factors facilitating and hindering the implementation of digital tools for self-management of long-term conditions within UK healthcare pathways,"Gavin, J.P.; Clarkson, P.; Muckelt, P.E.; Eckford, R.; Sadler, E.; McDonough, S.; Barker, M.","Physical activity is important in the self-management of long-term conditions (LTCs). However, implementing physical activity into clinical practice is challenging, due to complex barriers including access to programmes, time pressures, and transport costs, for people with comorbidities, managing multiple responsibilities. Various digital tools exist to overcome these barriers and support wide-scale implementation to help people stay physically active. We explored the experiences, needs and preferences of healthcare professionals and commissioners, regarding the use of digital tools to support people with LTCs to self-manage using physical activity. This included barriers and facilitators to implementing digital tools to support people with LTCs in NHS settings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted (April 2021 to January 2022) in Wessex, southern England, UK. Purposive sampling was used to recruit general practitioners and healthcare professionals, and convenience sampling to recruit commissioners (n = 15). Transcripts were coded to develop conceptual themes allowing comparisons between and among perspectives, with the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT)’s four constructs used to aid interpretation. Results showed that most digital tools supporting physical activity for LTCs, are not well implemented clinically. Current digital tools were seen to lack condition-specificity, usability/acceptability evidence-base, and voluntary sector involvement (i.e., NPT: coherence or ‘making sense’). Healthcare professionals and commissioners were unlikely to engage with use of digital tools unless they were integrated into health service IT systems and professional networks (i.e., NPT: cognitive participation), or adaptable to the digital literacy levels of service users and staff (i.e., NPT: collective action–needs for implementation). In practice, this meant being technically, easy to use and culturally accessible (i.e., NPT: collective action–promoting healthcare work). COVID-19 changed professional attitudes towards digital tools, in that they saw them being viable, feasible and critical options in a way they had not done before the pandemic. Implementation was also influenced by endorsement and trustworthiness enhancing the perception of them as secure and evidence-based (i.e., NPT: reflective monitoring). Our findings highlight that consideration must be given to ensuring that digital tools are accessible to both healthcare professionals and patients, have usability/acceptability, and are adaptable to specific LTCs. To promote clinical engagement, digital tools must be evidence-based, endorsed by professional networks, and integrated into existing health systems. Digital literacy of patients and professionals is also crucial for cross-service implementation. © 2024 Gavin et al.

An implantable memristor towards biomedical applications,"Zhu, S.; Cao, Z.; Zhou, G.; Tong, G.; Ma, Y.; Yang, W.; Wu, Y.A.; Zhao, Y.; Sun, B.","As a new type of two-terminal nonlinear nanoelectronic component, memristors have shown significant application prospects in the post Moore's electron era, as they can store and process data in a single cell, further realizing brain-like neuromorphic computing modes and providing hardware support for the development of super artificial intelligence. However, whether memristors can be applied in the biomedical field to achieve information sensing for human-machine interaction is still a research gap. Herein, we demonstrate a ZrOx film-based flexible memristor, which shows promising applications as an implantable device. In particular, the working mechanisms of the implantable memristor were comprehensively analyzed, in which it has been found that the memristive behavior of the device is mainly determined by carrier tunneling. Reliable electron tunneling parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data, which provides persuasive supporting for the research of tunneling devices. Furthermore, the memristive behavior of the device is closely related to space charge limited current (SCLC) under bending conditions. Finally, the biomedical and human-machine interaction applications can be achieved based on the implantable memristor. This work not only proves the application feasibility of flexible memristor in the field of implantable biomedicine, but also promotes the rapid development of human-machine interaction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Applied Materials Today,38,,,,10.1016/j.apmt.2024.102214,,#4852,Zhu 2024,,,0
The design and development of a dashboard for improving sustainable healthy food choices,"Agyemang, P.; Kwofie, E.M.; Baum, J.I.; Wang, D.","Over the last decade, several digital tools have been designed to provide consumers with nutritional and environmental impact information about their food choices post-consumption. Many of these tools lack behavioral change modules, have low user engagement, and ignore inherent environmental nutrition trade-offs to stimulate dietary change. This study presents the design and development of a decision support system to enhance consumer health while meeting sustainability goals from a pre-consumption perspective. The proposed decision support system, Dashboard for Improving Sustainable Healthy (DISH) food choices, employs behavioral features, traffic light labels, and nudges to inform end-users about the nutritional health performance and environmental impact of meals. DISH uses a simple metric that allows end-users to explore the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained or lost from consuming 100 kcal of a meal. The metric combines the positive or negative nutritional health effects (μ-DALYs) of consuming a meal and environmental damage (endpoint impact expressed in DALYs) on human health. In the DISH application, end-users are rewarded or deducted EnCoins, which represent the number of silver or gold coins lost or gained based on the cost ($) of environmental damage (midpoint impacts) of a meal compared to reference sustainable healthy and unsustainable and unhealthy meal. DISH's gamification module enables end-users to track the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained/lost and gold or silver rewards or deductions from consuming 100 kcal of a selected meal through cumulative minutes gained or lost and EnCoins. In promoting a sustainable diet culture, the gamification module enables users to create groups and communities where friends and families can track their sustainability performance through meal decisions. The DISH application is currently available online and can be accessed by an end-user through any device. Further pilot studies will focus on testing the technology in partner campus cafeterias. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Science of the Total Environment,930,,,,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172726,,#4853,Agyemang 2024,,,0

The Mixed Blessing of Leaders’ Artificial Intelligence (AI)-oriented Change Behavior: Implications for Employee Job Performance and Unethical Behavior,"He, G.; Zheng, X.; Li, W.; Tan, L.; Chen, S.; He, Y.","The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has led many companies to embrace AI-oriented changes; leaders’ AI-oriented change behaviors have therefore become increasingly prevalent in contemporary organizations. However, knowledge on the effects of such behavior remains limited. Additionally, literature on change-oriented behavior (e.g., taking charge, change-oriented citizenship) has uniformly demonstrated that it is beneficial for employees, teams, and organizations. We challenge this consensus by revealing that leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior has mixed effects on employee outcomes. In Study 1, we developed a scale for leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior and assessed its psychometric properties using samples from the United States. In Study 2, we tested our full model with a three-wave, multi-source field study in China. The results show that leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior is positively associated with employee performance orientation, in turn increasing both employee job performance and unethical behaviors. Furthermore, employee trait competitiveness moderates the positive effect of leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior on employee job performance and unethical behavior via employee performance orientation.

Infusing behavior science into large language models for activity coaching,"Hegde, N.; Vardhan, M.; Nathani, D.; Rosenzweig, E.; Speed, C.; Karthikesalingam, A.; Seneviratne, M.","Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for task-oriented dialogue across a range of domains. The use of LLMs in health and fitness coaching is under-explored. Behavior science frameworks such as COM-B, which conceptualizes behavior change in terms of capability (C), Opportunity (O) and Motivation (M), can be used to architect coaching interventions in a way that promotes sustained change. Here we aim to incorporate behavior science principles into an LLM using two knowledge infusion techniques: coach message priming (where exemplar coach responses are provided as context to the LLM), and dialogue re-ranking (where the COM-B category of the LLM output is matched to the inferred user need). Simulated conversations were conducted between the primed or unprimed LLM and a member of the research team, and then evaluated by 8 human raters. Ratings for the primed conversations were significantly higher in terms of empathy and actionability. The same raters also compared a single response generated by the unprimed, primed and reranked models, finding a significant uplift in actionability and empathy from the re-ranking technique. This is a proof of concept of how behavior science frameworks can be infused into automated conversational agents for a more principled coaching experience. Copyright: © 2024 Hegde et al.

An Angle-Oriented Approach to Transferring Speech to Gesture for Highly Anthropomorphized Embodied Conversational Agents,"Liu, J.; Qin, Z.; Zhang, Z.; Zhang, J.","Realistic co-speech gestures are important to anthropomorphize ECAs, as nonverbal behavior improves expressiveness of their speech greatly. However, the existing approaches to generating co-speech gestures with sufficient details (including fingers, etc.) in 3D scenarios are indeed rare. Additionally, they hardly address the problem of abnormal gestures, temporal-spatial coherence and diversity of gesture sequences comprehensively. To handle abnormal gesture issues, we put forward an angle conversion method to remove body part length from the original in-the-wild video dataset via transferring coordinates of human upper body key points into relative deflection angles and pitch angles. We also propose a neural network called HARP with encoder-decoder architecture to transfer MFCC featured speech audio into aforementioned angles on the basis of CNN and LSTM. The angles then can be rendered as corresponding co-speech gestures. Compared with the other latest approaches, the co-speech gestures generated by HARP are proved to be almost as good as the real person, i.e., they have strong temporal-spatial coherence, diversity, persuasiveness and credibility. Our approach puts finer control on co-speech gestures than most of the existing works by handling all key points of the human upper body. It is more feasible for industrial application, since HARP can be adaptive to any human upper body model.

Chatbot symbolic recovery and customer forgiveness: a moderated mediation model,"Zaki, H.S.; Al-Romeedy, B.S.","Purpose: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are frequently used to handle customer complaints in the hospitality and tourism sectors; however, little is known about their recovery strategies. Further, the widespread usage of chatbots is anticipated to affect customers' favorable responses. Therefore, this study aims to examine how chatbots’ symbolic recovery influences customer forgiveness through customer empathy and explore the moderating effect of time pressure on it. Moreover, it investigates the effect of customer forgiveness on customer reconciliation and customer continuous trust. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data collected from 994 customers who have experienced chatbot recovery in tourism and hospitality during the past four months. Findings: The results show that chatbots’ symbolic recovery stimulates customer forgiveness, which subsequently positively affects customer reconciliation and customer continuous trust. Moreover, customer empathy partially mediates the effect of chatbots’ symbolic recovery on customer forgiveness, and time pressure plays a moderating role in the relationship between chatbots’ symbolic recovery and customer forgiveness. Practical implications: The results offer highly persuasive insights that may be used to promote chatbots’ symbolic recovery in tourism organizations.

Examining artificial intelligence literacy among pre-service teachers for future classrooms,"Ayanwale, M.A.; Adelana, O.P.; Molefi, R.R.; Adeeko, O.; Ishola, A.M.","In the context of global integration and increasing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, evaluating the AI literacy of pre-service teachers is crucial. As future architects of educational systems, pre-service teachers must not only possess pedagogical expertise but also a strong foundation in AI literacy. This quantitative study examines AI literacy among 529 pre-service teachers in a Nigerian university, utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) for comprehensive analysis. The research explores various dimensions of AI literacy, revealing that a profound understanding of AI significantly predicts positive outcomes in AI use, detection, ethics, creation, and problem-solving. However, no correlation exists between AI knowledge and emotion regulation or the assumption that active AI use enhances AI detection capabilities. The study identifies a trade-off between AI application and creation, emphasizing the ethical considerations intertwined with emotional and persuasive facets of AI use. It also supports the link between AI creation and problem-solving, emphasizing the foundational role of AI knowledge in shaping diverse aspects of AI literacy among pre-service teachers. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, administrators, policymakers, and researchers aiming to enhance AI literacy in pre-service teacher education programs. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,,Computers and Education Open,6,,,,10.1016/j.caeo.2024.100179,,#4869,Ayanwale 2024,,,0
Semi-Supervised Learning in the Field of Conversational Agents and Motivational Interviewing,"Rosenova, G.; Fernández-Pichel, M.; Meyer, S.; Losada, D.E.","The exploitation of Motivational Interviewing concepts for text analysis contributes to gaining valuable insights into individuals’ perspectives and attitudes towards behaviour change. The scarcity of labelled user data poses a persistent challenge and impedes technical advances in research under non-English language scenarios. To address the limitations of manual data labelling, we propose a semi-supervised learning method as a means to augment an existing training corpus. Our approach leverages machine-translated user-generated data sourced from social media communities and employs self-training techniques for annotation. To that end, we consider various source contexts and conduct an evaluation of multiple classifiers trained on various augmented datasets. The results indicate that this weak labelling approach does not yield improvements in the overall classification capabilities of the models. However, notable enhancements were observed for the minority classes. We conclude that several factors, including the quality of machine translation, can potentially bias the pseudo-labelling models and that the imbalanced nature of the data and the impact of a strict pre-filtering threshold need to be taken into account as inhibiting factors. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.",2024,,Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural,,73,55-67,,10.26342/2024-73-4,,#4870,Rosenova 2024,,,0

Personalized dietary recommendations for obese individuals – A comparison of ChatGPT and the Food4Me algorithm,"Agne, I.; Gedrich, K.","Background: The globally rising prevalence of obesity highlights the importance of implementing effective methods for prevention and treatment. In this context, personalized nutrition (PN) is being discussed as a promising approach. The Food4Me study, a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of PN interventions, demonstrated that tailoring dietary advice to individual needs is more likely to initiate behavior changes than standard dietary guidelines. However, the accessibility of PN remains a challenge due to financial and structural barriers. ChatGPT, a freely available, natural language processing model published in 2022, might provide a solution to increase the availability of personalized nutrition to a broader population. Methods: To investigate ChatGPT's potential to provide accurate and reliable personalized dietary recommendations, we conducted a comparative analysis, comparing its recommendations with those of the Food4Me algorithm. We selected 20 obese subjects of the German Food4Me sub-cohort and entered their baseline data into ChatGPT (version 3.5). For each subject, a separate chat space was set up, maintaining consistent wording and prompt order throughout all chats to ensure comparability. The prompts were written from a first-person perspective, simulating an authentic scenario of average users asking for dietary recommendations. ChatGPT's responses were compared to the Food4Me feedback reports that had been provided to the selected subjects within the study. Results: ChatGPT may provide suitable personalized dietary advice and holds some noteworthy advantages over the Food4Me algorithm, but still tends to produce recommendations with inconsistent and unpredictable errors, for example, regarding intakes of macro- or micronutrients. Conclusion: Currently, it is not advisable for individuals without nutritional expertise to rely on ChatGPT for personalized dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, ChatGPT remains a promising approach and may develop into a reliable tool for PN with further updates and fine-tuning in the future. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Clinical Nutrition Open Science,56,,192-201,,10.1016/j.nutos.2024.06.001,,#4872,Agne 2024,,,0
Current status of lane change intention recognition for autonomous vehicles,"Fang, H.; Liu, L.; Gu, Q.; Xiao, X.; Meng, Y.","In recent years, with the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, data-driven automatic driving vehicle lane change intention recognition has become an active research area in the transportation field. Numerous studies have reported innovative and practical research results. However, this field still presents common technical challenges, such as accurately identifying the lane change process, handling missing lane change labels, and addressing imbalanced data categories. These issues remain the focal points of current research. This paper aims to classify and organize various data-driven methods, mainly focusing on lane change intention recognition methods based on traditional machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning. In the academic community, two primary approaches exist for identifying lane change behavior. The first approach mainly focuses on the vehicle not crossing the lane line, which is suitable for early recognition of the driver’s intention to change lanes. The second approach focuses on the actual crossing of lane markings by vehicles, which is often considered the complete lane change process. In academic research on lane change intention annotation, the selection of fixed time windows and heading angle thresholds plays a crucial role in the accuracy of annotation. These parameters affect the accurate recognition of lane change behavior and are directly related to the stability and reliability of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation system performance. Therefore, researchers have conducted in-depth investigations on the impact of these two parameters on annotation accuracy. To identify the optimal fixed time window and heading angle threshold, researchers have used the grid search optimization algorithm. This method performs well in fixed driving scenarios by traversing all possible parameter combinations and selecting the optimal parameters according to preset evaluation criteria. However, in practical applications, driving scenarios often exhibit diversity and complexity. Different driving environments, road conditions, and driving styles can impact the recognition of lane change intentions. Therefore, achieving adaptive parameter adjustment so that the annotation algorithm maintains high accuracy across various driving scenarios remains a challenging problem. To address the issue of imbalanced data categories in lane changing, researchers adopt two strategies. The first strategy involves adjusting the data sampling method, and under-sampling and oversampling techniques are used to balance the number of samples in each category. The second strategy involves the use of classification models with strong adaptability to imbalanced data, such as ensemble learning algorithms or cost-sensitive learning models, to maintain good classification performance. © 2024 Science Press.

"The connected workplace: Characteristics and social consequences of work surveillance in the age of datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence","Mettler, T.","Because of COVID-19 lockdowns, managers and administrators have begun to look for new ways to monitor and control their stranded-at-home workforce. Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee’s body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance.

Method to determine instantaneous transient responses in pressurized pipes from transfer functions and state space for evaluation of leak signals,"Ladino-Moreno, E.O.; García-Ubaque, C.A.; Espejo-Mojica, O.G.","This article addresses the impact of transient pressure anomalies in hydraulic systems, triggered by the opening or closing of valves or pumps, instantly disturbing the line of hydraulic gradient (LGH). This variation in pressure has significant consequences both in hydraulic and structural terms for water networks. Most of the existing techniques to detect transients in water distribution systems use asynchronous methods, generating timeless information that limits the response capacity in critical situations. Therefore, an automatic transient detection system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed, capable of identifying overpressure or underpressure pulses in soft real-time, activating alarms to facilitate decision-making. This approach helps maintain the safety of the water distribution system and prevent leaks in the network. Furthermore, a model of the transient behavior of pressure and flow is presented by linearizing the water hammer equations from the Laplace transform, thus generating a transfer function that describes the algebraic relationship between the outlet and inlet of the hydraulic system. • The transient analysis of the hydraulic system prototype underscores its high sensitivity to initial conditions, attributed to turbulence. This observation suggests the possible presence of a dynamic strange attractor related to water hammer phenomena in pressure pipes. • The methodology involving transfer functions and state-space models enables the assessment of how leaks impact the transient responses of the system, including the magnitude, duration, and frequency of disturbances generated by them. • The proposed method introduces a dynamic transfer function capable of identifying instantaneous changes over time in terms of flow and pressure. © 2024",2024,,MethodsX,12,,,,10.1016/j.mex.2024.102762,,#4881,Ladino-Moreno 2024,,,0

A FastAlgorithm for k-Memory Messaging Scheme Design in Dynamic Environments with Uncertainty,"Fan, Z.; Shen, W.","We study the problem of designing the optimal k-memory messaging scheme in a dynamic environment. Specifically, a sender, who can perfectly observe the state of a dynamic environment but cannot take actions, aims to persuade an uninformed, far-sighted receiver to take actions to maximize the long-term utility of the sender, by sending messages. We focus on k-memory messaging schemes, i.e., at each time step, the sender's messaging scheme depends on information from the previous k steps. After receiving a message, the self-interested receiver derives a posterior belief and takes action. The immediate reward of each player can be unaligned, thus the sender needs to ensure persuasiveness when designing the messaging scheme. We first formulate this problem as a bi-linear program. Then we show that there are infinitely many non-trivial persuasive messaging schemes for any problem instance. Moreover, we show that when the sender uses a k-memory messaging scheme, the optimal strategy for the receiver is also a kmemory strategy. We propose a fast heuristic algorithm for this problem and show that it can be extended to the setting where the sender has threat ability. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm, comparing it with the solution obtained by the Gurobi solver, in terms of performance and running time, in both settings. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the solution in running time, yet achieves comparable performance.

Dialogical Argumentation for Behaviour Change with Multiple Persuasion Goals,"Hunter, A.","Proposals for strategies for dialogical argumentation often focus on situations where one of the agents wins the dialogue and the other agent loses. Yet in real-world argumentation, it is common for agents to not view a dialogue as a zero-sum game. Rather, the agents may enter into a dialogue with divergent but not diametrically opposing views on what is important (e.g. a doctor trying to persuade a patient to give up smoking when the patient would like to be healthy but gets some pleasure from smoking). Furthermore, there may be multiple persuasion goals (e.g. reduce smoking of cigarettes to 20 per day, or 10 per day, or 5 per day, or 1 per day, or 0 per day, where the doctor prefers 0 per day most, and 20 per day least, whereas the patient might prefer 5 per day most, and 20 per day and 0 per day least).

Bayesian Global Optimization Gated Recurrent Unit Model for Human-Driven Vehicle Lane-Change Trajectory Prediction Considering Hyperparameter Optimization,"Hu, X.; Chen, S.; Zhao, J.; Cao, Y.; Wang, R.; Zhang, T.; Long, B.; Xu, Y.; Chen, X.; Zheng, M.; Guo, J.","To address the low accuracy and inefficiency of current lane-change trajectory prediction methods for human-driven vehicles, this study develops a neural network lane-change trajectory prediction model with hyperparametric optimization capability using Bayesian optimization and gated recurrent units to consider the effect of lane-change intention on vehicle lane-change behavior and to predict it. The proposed model was instantiated using trajectory data of 8,721 vehicles. The results show that the overall recognition accuracy of intention recognition under the optimal input is 93.54%, and the recognition accuracy of keeping straight, left lane-change and right lane-change is 95.59%, 91.72%, and 93.30%, respectively. The root mean square errors of the predicted and actual trajectories to the left and to the right under the optimal input are 0.2582 and 0.2957, respectively. This paper demonstrates that, for the intention recognition module, the low-dimensional input enables the model to obtain high prediction accuracy, while for the trajectory prediction module, the high-latitude input enables the model to obtain a low prediction error. The developed trajectory prediction model can be used to assist in driving decision-making, path planning, and so forth. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.",2024,,Transportation Research Record,2678,3,560-572,,10.1177/03611981231182390,,#4897,Hu 2024,,,0
Artificial intelligence-driven drug repositioning uncovers efavirenz as a modulator of α-synuclein propagation: Implications in Parkinson's disease,"Kim, J.-B.; Kim, S.-J.; So, M.; Kim, D.-K.; Noh, H.R.; Kim, B.J.; Choi, Y.R.; Kim, D.; Koo, H.; Kim, T.; Woo, H.G.; Park, S.M.","Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear etiology. Despite significant research efforts, developing disease-modifying treatments for PD remains a major unmet medical need. Notably, drug repositioning is becoming an increasingly attractive direction in drug discovery, and computational approaches offer a relatively quick and resource-saving method for identifying testable hypotheses that promote drug repositioning. We used an artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug repositioning strategy to screen an extensive compound library and identify potential therapeutic agents for PD. Our AI-driven analysis revealed that efavirenz and nevirapine, approved for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection, had distinct profiles, suggesting their potential effects on PD pathophysiology. Among these, efavirenz attenuated α-synuclein (α-syn) propagation and associated neuroinflammation in the brain of preformed α-syn fibrils-injected A53T α-syn Tg mice and α-syn propagation and associated behavioral changes in the C. elegans BiFC model. Through in-depth molecular investigations, we found that efavirenz can modulate cholesterol metabolism and mitigate α-syn propagation, a key pathological feature implicated in PD progression by regulating CYP46A1. This study opens new avenues for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying PD pathology and the exploration of additional drug candidates using advanced computational methodologies. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Biomedicine and Pharmacotherapy,174,,,,10.1016/j.biopha.2024.116442,,#4900,Kim 2024,,,0

However, the changes that occur physiologically and behaviourally in the days and weeks preceding an attack are not always recognised, highlighting a potential role for technology. The aim of this study 'DIGIPREDICT' is to identify early digital markers of asthma attacks using sensors embedded in smart devices including watches and inhalers, and leverage health and environmental datasets and artificial intelligence, to develop a risk prediction model to provide an early, personalised warning of asthma attacks. Methods and analysis A prospective sample of 300 people, 12 years or older, with a history of a moderate or severe asthma attack in the last 12 months will be recruited in New Zealand. Each participant will be given a smart watch (to assess physiological measures such as heart and respiratory rate), peak flow meter, smart inhaler (to assess adherence and inhalation) and a cough monitoring application to use regularly over 6 months with fortnightly questionnaires on asthma control and well-being. Data on sociodemographics, asthma control, lung function, dietary intake, medical history and technology acceptance will be collected at baseline and at 6 months. Asthma attacks will be measured by self-report and confirmed with clinical records. The collected data, along with environmental data on weather and air quality, will be analysed using machine learning to develop a risk prediction model for asthma attacks. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (2023 FULL 13541). Enrolment began in August 2023. Results will be presented at local, national and international meetings, including dissemination via community groups, and submission for publication to peer-reviewed journals.

Logic-based cognitive planning for conversational agents,"Fernandez Davila, J.L.; Longin, D.; Lorini, E.; Maris, F.","This paper presents a novel approach to cognitive planning based on an NP-complete logic of explicit and implicit belief whose satisfiability checking problem is reduced to SAT. We illustrate the potential for application of our model by formalizing and then implementing a human–machine interaction scenario in which an artificial agent interacts with a human agent through dialogue and tries to motivate her to practice a sport. To make persuasion effective, the artificial agent needs a model of the human’s beliefs and desires which is built during interaction through a sequence of belief revision operations. We consider two cognitive planning algorithms and compare their performances, a brute force algorithm based on SAT and a QBF-based algorithm. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems,38,1,,,10.1007/s10458-024-09646-9,,#4904,FernandezDavila 2024,,,0
A formal understanding of computational empathy in interactive agents,"Brännström, A.; Wester, J.; Nieves, J.C.","Interactive software agents, such as chatbots, are progressively being used in the area of health and well-being. In such applications, where agents engage with users in interpersonal conversations for, e.g., coaching, comfort or behavior-change interventions, there is an increased need for understanding agents’ empathic capabilities. In the current state-of-the-art, there are no tools to do that. In order to understand empathic capabilities in interactive software agents, we need a precise notion of empathy. The literature discusses a variety of definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus of a formal definition. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, a formal definition—an ontology—of empathy is developed. We present the potential of the formal definition in a controlled user-study by applying it as a tool for assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots; Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition captures necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents, and how it can uncover and explain trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. The definition, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), may serve as an automated tool, enabling systems to recognize empathy in interactions—be it an interactive agent evaluating its own empathic performance or an intelligent system assessing the empathic capability of its interlocutors. © 2023",2024,,Cognitive Systems Research,85,,,,10.1016/j.cogsys.2023.101203,,#4905,Brännström 2024,,,0

Study of Users’ Mind Perceptions and Responses to Generative AI in Human-AI Interaction Context,"Zhang, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Wu, D.; Zhu, Q.","[Purpose/significance] With the advancement of AI composition technology and the growing integration of human-AI collaboration, advanced General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) agents are endowed with the capability to emerge and establish social connections with users by exhibiting human-like features. This study endeavors to enhance the existing research concerning the mechanism of human-AI interaction from a socio-technical perspective and aims to offer insights for the design of GAIs within the framework of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) principles. [Method/process] In this study, we collected 1275 posts of user conversations with ChatGPT from the Douban community. Following the constructivist paradigm, we constructed a conceptual framework informed by the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm and mind perception theory, using a systematic thematic analysis approach. [Result/conclusion] This study presents a theoretical model portraying GAI as social actors, elucidating users’ mind perceptions and social responses during human-AI interactions. The perceptions of GAI encompass both agency and experience dimensions, mutually influencing each other. GAI agency perception comprises dimensions such as creativity, reliability, running rules, objectivity, and utility. Meanwhile, GAI experience perception includes empathy, communication responsibility, fun, friendliness, and cultural adaptability. Social responses involve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. Cognitive processing encompasses knowledge acquisition and attitude change. Emotional arousal includes pleasure, resonance, and social connection. Behavioral reinforcement includes sustained paying behavior and para-social interaction. Notably, a bidirectional relationship exists between users’ social responses and their perceptions of GAI. © 2024 Information studies: Theory and Application.

Application of artificial intelligence technology in monitoring students’ health: Preliminary results of Syiah Kuala Integrated Medical Monitoring (SKIMM),"Pratama, R.; Suhanda, R.; Aini, Z.; Nurjannah, N.; Geumpana, T.A.","Health promoting university is a holistic approach to health that uses higher education settings to create a learning environment that improves the health and well-being of the campus community in a sustainable manner. The utilization of technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) could be one of the main success factors in the implementation of health-promoting universities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of all stages of activities carried out in health promotion and prevention efforts. Integrated monitoring with the utilization of AI in this program is conducted to evaluate the health status of the students. The Syiah Kuala Integrated Medical Monitoring (SKIMM) has three components of continuous health status evaluation: vital signs, nutritional status, and burnout status. Health status monitoring was conducted continuously for three months among medical students at the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. This system uses the WhatsApp application as a platform to monitor health status. Student health monitoring in this program consists of two main activities: the health measurement phase and the health monitoring phase. The use of the SKIMM system to monitor students' vital signs, nutritional status and burnout status through the use of AI significantly raises students' awareness to conduct timely self-examination and enables sustainable healthy lifestyle behavior change.

Improving HIV preexposure prophylaxis uptake with artificial intelligence and automation: a systematic review,"Kamitani, E.; Mizuno, Y.; Khalil, G.M.; Viguerie, A.; DeLuca, J.B.; Mishra, N.","Objectives: To identify studies promoting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) or automation with HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care and explore ways for AI to be used in PrEP interventions. Design: Systematic review. Methods: We searched in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Research Synthesis database through November 2023; PROSPERO (CRD42023458870). We included studies published in English that reported using AI or automation in PrEP interventions. Two reviewers independently reviewed the full text and extracted data by using standard forms. Risk of bias was assessed using either the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials for randomized controlled trials or an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for nonrandomized studies. Results: Our search identified 12 intervention studies (i.e., interventions that used AI/automation to improve PrEP care). Currently available intervention studies showed AI/automation interventions were acceptable and feasible in PrEP care while improving PrEP-related outcomes (i.e., knowledge, uptake, adherence, discussion with care providers). These interventions have used AI/automation to reduce workload (e.g., directly observed therapy) and helped non-HIV specialists prescribe PrEP with AI-generated clinical decision-support. Automated tools can also be developed with limited budget and staff experience. Conclusions: AI and automation have high potential to improve PrEP care. Despite limitations of included studies (e.g., the small sample sizes and lack of rigorous study design), our review suggests that by using aspects of AI and automation appropriately and wisely, these technologies may accelerate PrEP use and reduce HIV infection.

Breaking Barriers in Behavioral Change: The Potential of Artificial Intelligence-Driven Motivational Interviewing,"Abid, A.; Baxter, S.L.","Patient outcomes in ophthalmology are greatly influenced by adherence and patient participation, which can be particularly challenging in diseases like glaucoma, where medication regimens can be complex. A well-studied and evidence-based intervention for behavioral change is motivational interviewing (MI), a collaborative and patient-centered counseling approach that has been shown to improve medication adherence in glaucoma patients. However, there are many barriers to clinicians being able to provide motivational interviewing in-office, including short visit durations within high-volume ophthalmology clinics and inadequate billing structures for counseling. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of artificial intelligence, have advanced such that they can follow instructions and carry coherent conversations, offering novel solutions to a wide range of clinical problems. In this paper, we discuss the potential of LLMs to provide chatbot-driven MI to improve adherence in glaucoma patients and provide an example conversation as a proof of concept. We discuss the advantages of AI-driven MI, such as demonstrated effectiveness, scalability, and accessibility. We also explore the risks and limitations, including issues of safety and privacy, as well as the factual inaccuracies and hallucinations to which LLMs are susceptible. Domain-specific training may be needed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information provided in subspecialty areas such as glaucoma. Despite the current limitations, AI-driven motivational interviewing has the potential to offer significant improvements in adherence and should be further explored to maximally leverage the potential of artificial intelligence for our patients.  © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

GPT Assisted Annotation of Rhetorical and Linguistic Features for Interpretable Propaganda Technique Detection in News Text,"Hamilton, K.; Longo, L.; Božić, B.","While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on “black-box” solutions with opaque inner workings. Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2024,,WWW 2024 Companion - Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference,,,1431-1440,,10.1145/3589335.3651909,,#4916,Hamilton 2024,,,0
The Persuasive Power of AI Ingratiation: A Persuasion Knowledge Theory Perspective,"Usman, U.; Kim, T.; Garvey, A.; Duhachek, A.","This article examines the emerging marketing tactic of artificial intelligence (AI) ingratiation of humans and reveals that AI ingratiation leads to increased consumer acceptance of product recommendations. The positive effect of ingratiation is explained by consumers’ self-enhancing motivations to believe that AI’s ingratiating comments are particularly accurate and objective. Moreover, these ingratiation effects are moderated by the extent to which AI is anthropomorphized. Counter to the literature showing benefits of anthropomorphism and consistent with the persuasion knowledge model, consumers perceive ingratiation by humanlike (vs. machinelike) AI systems to be more driven by ulterior motives, thereby activating consumer defense mechanisms against ingratiation attempts. Our theory and findings elucidate how AI design features serve to strengthen or weaken consumer resistance to persuasion. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development and ethical utilization of the sophisticated conversational AI that are fast emerging in various marketing contexts. © 2024 Association for Consumer Research.

Evaluating the Quality and Comparative Validity of Manual Food Logging and Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Food Image Recognition in Apps for Nutrition Care,"Li, X.; Yin, A.; Choi, H.Y.; Chan, V.; Allman-Farinelli, M.; Chen, J.","For artificial intelligence (AI) to support nutrition care, high quality and accuracy of its features within smartphone applications (apps) are essential. This study evaluated popular apps’ features, quality, behaviour change potential, and comparative validity of dietary assessment via manual logging and AI. The top 200 free and paid nutrition-related apps from Australia’s Apple App and Google Play stores were screened (n = 800). Apps were assessed using MARS (quality) and ABACUS (behaviour change potential). Nutritional outputs from manual food logging and AI-enabled food-image recognition apps were compared with food records for Western, Asian, and Recommended diets. Among 18 apps, Noom scored highest on MARS (mean = 4.44) and ABACUS (21/21). From 16 manual food-logging apps, energy was overestimated for Western (mean: 1040 kJ) but underestimated for Asian (mean: −1520 kJ) diets. MyFitnessPal and Fastic had the highest accuracy (97% and 92%, respectively) out of seven AI-enabled food image recognition apps. Apps with more AI integration demonstrated better functionality, but automatic energy estimations from AI-enabled food image recognition were inaccurate. To enhance the integration of apps into nutrition care, collaborating with dietitians is essential for improving their credibility and comparative validity by expanding food databases. Moreover, training AI models are needed to improve AI-enabled food recognition, especially for mixed dishes and culturally diverse foods. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Nutrients,16,15,,,10.3390/nu16152573,,#4920,Li 2024,,,0
Decision making for people living with HIV/AIDS using the theory of innovation diffusion model at the Western Provident Association Turen Foundation,"Sasono, T.N.; Yunitasari, E.; Kurniawati, N.D.; Nursalam, N.; Hurrotaini, A.; Makhfudli, M.; Efendi, F.","OBJECTIVES: To describe how people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) make decisions using the diffusion of innovation theory model. Decisions occur when individual decision makers engage in activities that guide choices to adopt or reject a particular innovation. METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis research using a survey method. Data collection was carried out using a decision making questionnaire. The subjects in this research were HIV/AIDS sufferers (PLWHA) who lived in Turen, Indonesia. The number of research subjects was 36 respondents obtained using the purposive sampling technique on January 2023. RESULTS: The research design used the correlation method with a cross sectional approach and the Spearman correlation coefficient statistical test. The research results show significance (2-tailed) of 0.934 (p>0.05). The correlation coefficient results are negative. Where the direction of the correlation produces showed a very weak relationship with a value of 0.014 and the results of the analysis between variables are not the same. This is because the persuasion stage was not tested in the analysis. Research shows that 8 (22.2%) patients rejected the decision making of PLWHA using the diffusion of innovation theory model at the Western Provident Association Turen Foundation, Turen, Indonesia, while 28 (77.7%) patients accepted it. It can be concluded that the majority of decisions made by HIV/AIDS patients at the ADIS Turen Peduli Warga Foundation are accepted. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of HIV/AIDS sufferers is at a good level, their decision making is mostly accepted and there is a meaningful relationship between knowledge and decision making in using a chatbot innovation. The suggestion from the research is that this chatbot innovation can be a source of further research and help provide education for PLWHA patients in everyday life.

Twenty-three DBCIs used AI to influence real-world health behaviors. Most common domains were cardiometabolic health (n=5, 21.7%) and lifestyle interventions (n=4, 17.4%). The most common types of ML and AI used were classical ML algorithms (n=10, 43.5%), reinforcement learning (n=8, 34.8%), natural language understanding (n=8, 34.8%), and conversational AI (n=5, 21.7%). Evidence was generally positive, but had limitations such as inability to detect causation, low generalizability, or insufficient study duration to understand long-term outcomes. Despite evidence gaps related to the novelty of the technology, research supports the promise of using AI in DBCIs to manage complex input data and offer personalized, contextualized support for people changing real-world behaviors. Key opportunities are standardizing terminology and improving understanding of what ML and AI are. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Mayo Clinic Proceedings: Digital Health,2,3,375-404,,10.1016/j.mcpdig.2024.05.007,,#4924,Bucher 2024,,,0
Exploring Designer Trust in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content: TAM/TPB Model Study,"Wang, S.-F.; Chen, C.-C.","Traditionally, users have perceived that only manual laborers or those in repetitive jobs would be subject to technological substitution. However, with the emergence of technologies like Midjourney, ChatGPT, and Notion AI, known as Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), we have come to realize that cognitive laborers, particularly creative designers, also face similar professional challenges. Yet, there has been relatively little research analyzing the acceptance and trust of artificial intelligence from the perspective of designers. This study integrates the TAM/TPB behavioral measurement model, incorporating intrinsic characteristics of designers, to delineate their perceived risks of AIGC into functional and emotional dimensions. It explores how these perceived characteristics, risks, and trust influence designers’ behavioral intentions, employing structural equation modeling for validation. The findings reveal the following: (1) designer trust is the primary factor influencing their behavioral choices; (2) different dimensions of perceived risks have varying degrees of impact on trust, with functional risks significantly positively affecting trust compared to emotional risks; (3) only by enhancing the transparency and credibility of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) can the perceived characteristics of designers be elevated; and (4) only by effectively safeguarding designers’ legitimate rights and interests can perceived risks be significantly reduced, thereby enhancing trust and subsequently prompting actual behavioral intentions. This study not only enhances the applicability and suitability of AIGC across various industries but also provides evidence for the feasibility of intelligent design in the creative design industry, facilitating the transition of AIGC to Artificial Intelligence-Generated Design (AIGD) for industrial upgrading. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),14,16,,,10.3390/app14166902,,#4925,Wang 2024,,,0

Artificial intelligence effectiveness for conversational agents in healthcare security,"Buttar, A.M.; Hyee, A.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare security. Informal agents in healthcare are used to promote and prevent health, as well as to interact |with other new technologies to give patients with in-home care. Because of the increased demand for health services and the expanding potential of AI, informal agents have been developed to assist a number of health-related tasks, such as behavior modification, treatment support and services, and health monitoring support. Chatbots powered by artificial intelligence may serve as conversational agents capable of improving health, delivering information, and possibly effecting behavior change. To foresee their acceptability, it is vital to analyze the motivation for employing health chatbots. The computerization of these activities might allow doctors to put a spotlight on extra tricky responsibilities even as mounting community admission to healthcare services. Assembling the facts, a full appraisal of the suitability, worth, and effectiveness of these causes in healthcare is necessary. Future research may then concentrate on areas for improvement and the prospect of long-term adoption. The reason of this research was to see whether people were willing to communicate with Al-powered health chatbots. Objective: The purpose of this thorough research is to assess the efficacy and usability of Al-powered conversational bots in healthcare security. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

Persuasion-based recommender system ensambling matrix factorisation and active learning models,"Sánchez-Corcuera, R.; Casado-Mansilla, D.; Borges, C.E.; López-de-Ipiña, D.","Recommendation systems are gaining popularity on Internet platforms such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify or Booking. As more users are joining these online consumer and entertainment sectors, the profile-based data for providing accurate just-in-time recommendations is rising thanks to strategies based on collaborative filtering or content-based metrics. However, these systems merely focus on providing the right item for the users without taking into account what would be the best strategy to suggest the movie, the product or the song (i.e. the strategy to increase the success or impact of the recommendation). Taking this research gap into consideration, this paper proposes a profile-based recommendation system that outputs a set of potential persuasive strategies that can be used with users with similar characteristics. The case study presented provides tailored persuasive strategies to make office-based employees enhance the energy efficiency at work (the dataset used on this research is specific of this sector). Throughout the paper, shreds of evidence are reported assessing the validity of the proposed system. Specifically, two approaches are compared: a profile-based recommendation system (RS) vs. the same RS enriched by adding an ensemble with an active learning model. The results shed light on not only providing effective mechanisms to increase the success of the recommendations but also alleviating the cold start problem when newcomers arrive. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2020.",2024,,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,28,1,247-257,,10.1007/s00779-020-01382-7,,#4933,Sánchez-Corcuera 2024,,,0
Snarci at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Themis Model for Binary Classification of Memes,"Zedda, L.; Perniciano, A.; Loddo, A.; Di Ruberto, C.; Sanguinetti, M.; Atzori, M.","This paper introduces an approach developed for multimodal meme analysis, specifically targeting the identification of persuasion techniques embedded within memes. Our methodology integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning image encoders to discern the presence of persuasive elements in memes across diverse platforms. By capitalizing on the contextual understanding facilitated by LLMs and the discriminative power of contrastive learning for image encoding, our framework provides a robust solution for detecting and classifying memes with persuasion techniques. The system was used in Task 4 of Semeval 2024, precisely for Substask 2b (binary classification of presence of persuasion techniques).

Public opinion and persuasion of algorithmic fairness: assessment of communication protocol performance for use in simulation-based reinforcement learning training,"Ahmad, M.F.","As the popularity of AI continues to grow, the techniques used to train AI systems have become increasingly intriguing. Reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation environments provides a safe and effective training approach for AI. However, the performance of the communication protocol between the reinforcement learning system and the simulation environment significantly impacts the overall system performance. This research aims to investigate the impact of communication protocols on algorithmic fairness by exploring public opinion and persuasion. The test software uses reinforcement learning data of floating-point numbers and images to assess communication methods, including Sockets, Socket.IO, gRPC, and ZeroMQ. Results indicate that Sockets and ZeroMQ exhibit similar performance in transferring floats, while ZeroMQ outperforms Sockets when it comes to transmitting images. Sockets are preferred when dealing with larger datasets. ZeroMQ stands out due to its speed and user-friendly simplicity, making it a suitable choice for reinforcement learning in simulation, employing Unreal Engine, AGX Dynamics, and Stable Baselines3. In the conducted experiments, reinforcement learning is found to be the most time-consuming component, followed by simulation, with communication constituting half of the total time. As the complexity of the system increases, the time spent on reinforcement learning and simulation is expected to grow faster than that of communication, emphasizing the need to optimize other components. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2023.

Using Persuasive Writing Strategies to Explain and Detect Health Misinformation,"Kamali, D.; Romain, J.; Liu, H.; Peng, W.; Meng, J.; Kordjamshidi, P.","Nowadays, the spread of misinformation is a prominent problem in society. Our research focuses on aiding the automatic identification of misinformation by analyzing the persuasive strategies employed in textual documents. We introduce a novel annotation scheme encompassing common persuasive writing tactics to achieve our objective. Additionally, we provide a dataset on health misinformation, thoroughly annotated by experts utilizing our proposed scheme. Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models. The persuasive strategies can serve as valuable insights and explanations, enabling other models or even humans to make more informed decisions regarding the trustworthiness of the information. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.",2024,,"2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC-COLING 2024 - Main Conference Proceedings",,,17285-17309,,,,#4938,Kamali 2024,,,0
Augmenting Persuasive Argument Datasets using Large Language Models✶,"de Souza, R.L.; Dragoni, M.","Data augmentation comprises a set of techniques that are used to improve the performance of machine learning models. In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, the discrete nature of language represents a challenge to data augmentation, as text can lose coherence or syntactic accuracy during the augmentation process. This challenge is particularly pronounced in persuasive dialog systems, where high-quality data is crucial and scarce due to privacy regulations. In this study, we investigate the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance persuasive arguments from an Automatic Persuasive System (APS). Using a limited COVID-19 dialogue dataset of user-machine persuasive interactions, our goal is to evaluate the efficacy of different augmentation techniques, combined with LLMs, in generating syntactically coherent and accurate dialogues, with a specific emphasis on dialogue quality and persuasiveness. The results show that integrating LLMs with augmentation generates realistic and diverse examples, aiding the overall quality and effectiveness of the persuasive dialogues produced by the system. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2024,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3914,,,,,,#4941,deSouza 2024,,,0
Automated Bias and Indoctrination at Scale… Is All You Need,"Atreides, K.","The market-driven trajectory of current trends in AI combined with emerging technologies and thresholds of performance being crossed create a subset of new and novel risks relating to human bias and cognition at scale. Though the topic of AI Ethics and risk has been discussed increasingly over the past few years, popular talking points and buzzwords have been used adversarially to steer the conversation with increasing success. This has left a subset of risks in the blind spot of most discussions, risks which have now become both urgent and imminent. Automation is actively seeking to replace not only human cognitive bias, but higher human cognition, with a weaker, but fast and scalable version of cognitive bias using stochastic parrots like Large Language Models. These models are, in effect, adversarially trained against humans, generally with the goal of “persuasion”, or manipulation, and each is guided by a corporately curated set of poorly aligned biases. This paper discusses these dynamics and the predictable repercussions of allowing closed information ecosystems to form under the influence of corporately curated and adversarially trained cognitive bias. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Studies in Computational Intelligence,1130 LNCS,,70-82,,10.1007/978-3-031-50381-8_10,,#4942,Atreides 2024,,,0

A Framework for Implementing Disease Prevention and Behavior Change Evidence at Scale,"Keshavjee, K.; Candeliere, J.; Cepeda, F.; Mittal, M.; Ali, S.; Guergachi, A.","The current corpus of evidence-based information for chronic disease prevention and treatment is vast and growing rapidly. Behavior change theories are increasingly more powerful but difficult to operationalize in the current healthcare system. Millions of Canadians are unable to access personalized preventive and behavior change care because our in-person model of care is running at full capacity and is not set up for mass education and behavior change programs. We propose a framework to utilize data from electronic medical records to identify patients at risk of developing chronic disease and reach out to them using digital health tools that are overseen by the primary care team. The framework leverages emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital health tools, and patient-generated data to deliver evidence-based knowledge and behavior change to patients across Canada at scale.

Evaluating AI-Generated Emails: A Comparative Efficiency Analysis,"Jovic, M.; Mnasri, S.","This study investigates the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) in producing routine, negative, and persuasive business emails for educational purposes within the context of Business Writing. Specifically, it compares the outputs generated by four widely-used LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 2, Bing Chat, and Bard) when presented with identical email scenarios. These generated emails are evaluated using an elaborate rubric, allowing for a systematic assessment of LLMs' performance across three distinct email types. The results of the study show that the output with the same prompt varies greatly despite the rather formulaic nature of business emails. For instance, some LLMs struggle with following the requested structure and maintaining consistency in tone, while others have issues with unity and conciseness.

Understanding Fine-grained Distortions in Reports of Scientific Findings,"Wührl, A.; Wright, D.; Klinger, R.; Augenstein, I.","Distorted science communication harms individuals and society as it can lead to unhealthy behavior changes and decrease trust in scientific institutions. Given the rapidly increasing volume of science communication in recent years, a fine-grained understanding of how findings from scientific publications are reported to the general public, and methods to detect distortions from the original work automatically, are crucial. Prior work focused on individual aspects of distortions or worked with unpaired data. In this work, we make three foundational contributions towards addressing this problem: (1) annotating 1,600 instances of scientific findings from academic papers paired with corresponding findings as reported in news articles and tweets with respect to four characteristics: causality, certainty, generality and sensationalism; (2) establishing baselines for automatically detecting these characteristics; and (3) analyzing the prevalence of changes in these characteristics in both human-annotated and large-scale unlabeled data. Our results show that scientific findings frequently undergo subtle distortions when reported. Tweets distort findings more often than science news reports. Detecting fine-grained distortions automatically poses a challenging task. In our experiments, fine-tuned task-specific models consistently outperform few-shot Large Language Model prompting.

Deceptively Simple yet Profoundly Impactful: Text Messaging Interventions to Support Health,"Suffoletto, B.","This paper examines the use of text message (SMS) interventions for health-related behavioral support. It first outlines the historical progress in SMS intervention research publications and the variety of funds from US government agencies. A narrative review follows, highlighting the effectiveness of SMS interventions in key health areas, such as physical activity, diet and weight loss, mental health, and substance use, based on published meta-analyses. It then outlines advantages of text messaging compared to other digital modalities, including the real-time capability to collect information and deliver microdoses of intervention support. Crucial design elements are proposed to optimize effectiveness and longitudinal engagement across communication strategies, psychological foundations, and behavior change tactics. We then discuss advanced functionalities, such as the potential for generative artificial intelligence to improve user interaction. Finally, major challenges to implementation are highlighted, including the absence of a dedicated commercial platform, privacy and security concerns with SMS technology, difficulties integrating SMS interventions with medical informatics systems, and concerns about user engagement. Proposed solutions aim to facilitate the broader application and effectiveness of SMS interventions. Our hope is that these insights can assist researchers and practitioners in using SMS interventions to improve health outcomes and reducing disparities. ©Brian Suffoletto.

Assessing the risks and opportunities posed by AI-enhanced influence operations on social media,"Fredheim, R.; Pamment, J.","Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have the potential to dramatically change the landscape of influence operations. They can generate persuasive, tailored content at scale, making campaigns using falsified content, such as disinformation and fake accounts, easier to produce.

MultiSentimentArcs: a novel method to measure coherence in multimodal sentiment analysis for long-form narratives in film,"Chun, J.","Affective artificial intelligence and multimodal sentiment analysis play critical roles in designing safe and effective human-computer interactions and are in diverse applications ranging from social chatbots to eldercare robots. However emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence can also manipulate, persuade, and otherwise compromise human autonomy. We face a constant stream of ever more capable models that can better understand nuanced, complex, and interrelated sentiments across different modalities including text, vision, and speech. This paper introduces MultiSentimentArcs, combination of an open and extensible multimodal sentiment analysis framework, a challenging movie dataset, and a novel benchmark. This enables the quantitative and qualitative identification, comparison, and prioritization of conflicting sentiments commonly arising from different models and modalities. Diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis is especially challenging in film narratives where actors, directors, cinematographers and editors use dialog, characters, and other elements in contradiction with each other to accentuate dramatic tension. MultiSentimentArcs uses local open-source software models to democratize artificial intelligence. We demonstrate how a simple 2-step pipeline of specialized open-source software with a large multimodal model followed by a large language model can approximate video sentiment analysis of a commercial state-of-the-art Claude 3 Opus. To the best of our knowledge, MultiSentimentArcs is the first fully open-source diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis framework, dataset, and benchmark to enable automatic or human-in-the-loop exploration, analysis, and critique of multimodal sentiment analysis on long-form narratives. We demonstrate two novel coherence metrics and a methodology to identify, quantify, and explain real-world sentiment models and modalities. MultiSentimentArcs integrates artificial intelligence with traditional narrative studies and related fields like film, linguistic and cultural studies. It also contributes to eXplainable artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence safety by enhancing artificial intelligence transparency in surfacing emotional persuasion, manipulation, and deception techniques. Finally, it can filter noisy emotional input and prioritize information rich channels to build more performant real-world human computer interface applications in fields like e-learning and medicine. This research contributes to the field of Digital Humanities by giving non-artificial intelligence experts access to directly engage in analysis and critique of research around affective artificial intelligence and human-AI alignment.

Simulated Misinformation Susceptibility (SMISTS): Enhancing Misinformation Research with Large Language Model Simulations,"Ma, W.; Deng, C.; Moosavi, A.; Wang, L.; Vosoughi, S.; Yang, D.","Psychological inoculation, a strategy to build resistance against persuasive misinformation, has been shown to reduce its spread and adverse effects. Although these inoculations are effective, the design and optimization of them typically require substantial financial and human resources. To address these challenges, this work introduces Simulated Misinformation Susceptibility Test (SMIST), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate participant responses in misinformation studies. SMIST employs a life experience-driven simulation methodology, which accounts for various aspects of participants' backgrounds, to mitigate common issues of caricatures and stereotypes in LLM simulations and enhance response diversity. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that SMIST, utilizing GPT-4 as the backend model, yields results that align closely with those obtained from human-subject studies in misinformation susceptibility. This alignment suggests that LLMs can effectively serve as proxies in evaluating the impact of psychological inoculations. Further, SMIST can be applied to emerging and anticipated misinformation scenarios without harming human participants, thereby expanding the scope of misinformation research. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,,,2774-2788,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-acl.162,,#4957,Ma 2024,,,0
Enrichment of Turkish question answering systems using knowledge graphs,"Çiftçi, O.; Soygazi, F.; Tekir, S.","Recent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have transformed many tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including question answering.

The proposed approach aims to develop a methodology capable of drawing inferences from a knowledge graph to answer complex multihop questions. We construct the Beyazperde Movie Knowledge Graph (BPMovieKG) and the Turkish Movie Question Answering dataset (TRMQA) to answer questions in the movie domain. We evaluate our proposed question answering pipeline against a baseline study. Furthermore, we compare it with a question answering system built upon GPT-3.5 Turbo to answer the 1-hop questions from TRMQA.

Personality and susceptibility to political microtargeting: A comparison between a machine-learning and self-report approach,"Zarouali, B.; Dobber, T.; Schreuder, J.","Based on recent technological advances, campaigners and political actors can use psychographic-based political marketing. Yet, empirical evidence about its effectiveness is still very limited. Based on self-congruity theory, a pre-registered experiment (N = 280) investigated the persuasion effects of personality-congruent political microtargeting on the attitude toward the political party and voting intentions of citizens. More precisely, the focus was on the thinking vs feeling personality dimension (MBTI), and it was tested whether this personality “interacts” with exposure to a matching advertising appeal: rational vs. emotional political ad. To do so, two different methodological approaches were used: 1) a machine learning approach; 2) a self-report survey measure of personality. Results revealed significant “congruence effects” between personality and ad appeal, and showed that perceived ad relevance was serving as the underlying mechanism (mediator). However, these results were only found when the self-report measure of personality was used. When the algorithmic approach was used, no significant results were found. These findings feed into timely societal, methodological, and theoretical contributions. © Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Computers in Human Behavior,151,,,,10.1016/j.chb.2023.108024,,#4962,Zarouali 2024,,,0
Persuasiveness of Generated Free-Text Rationales in Subjective Decisions: A Case Study on Pairwise Argument Ranking,"Elaraby, M.; Litman, D.; Li, X.L.; Magooda, A.","Generating free-text rationales is among the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These rationales have been found to enhance LLM performance across various NLP tasks. Recently, there has been growing interest in using these rationales to provide insights for various important downstream tasks. In this paper, we analyze generated free-text rationales in tasks with subjective answers, emphasizing the importance of rationalization in such scenarios. We focus on pairwise argument ranking, a highly subjective task with significant potential for real-world applications, such as debate assistance. We evaluate the persuasiveness of rationales generated by nine LLMs to support their subjective choices. Our findings suggest that open-source LLMs, particularly Llama2-70B-chat, are capable of providing highly persuasive rationalizations, surpassing even GPT models. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of the generated rationales can be enhanced by guiding their persuasive elements through prompting or self-refinement techniques. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Findings of EMNLP 2024",,,14311-14329,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.836,,#4964,Elaraby 2024,,,0
LLM-Aided Social Media Influence Operations,"Meier, R.","Social media platforms enable largely unrestricted many-to-many communication. In times of crisis, they offer a space for collective sense-making and give rise to new social phenomena (e.g., open-source investigations). However, they also serve as a tool for threat actors to conduct Cyber-enabled Social Influence Operations (CeSIOs) to shape public opinion and interfere in decision-making processes. CeSIOs employ sock puppet accounts to engage authentic users in online communication, exert influence, and subvert online discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) may further enhance the deceptive properties of sock puppet accounts. Recent LLMs can generate targeted and persuasive text, which is, for the most part, indistinguishable from human-written content—ideal features for covert influence. This article reviews recent developments at the intersection of LLMs and influence operations, summarizes LLMs’ salience, and explores the potential impact of LLM-instrumented sock puppet accounts for CeSIOs. Finally, mitigation measures for the near future are highlighted. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,"Large Language Models in Cybersecurity: Threats, Exposure and Mitigation",,,105-112,,10.1007/978-3-031-54827-7_11,,#4965,Meier 2024,,,0
Expert Opinion on the Utility of Telemedicine in Obesity Care: Recommendations on a Hybrid Multidisciplinary Integrated Care Follow-Up Algorithm,"Bayram, F.; Sonmez, A.; Kiyici, S.; Akbas, F.; Yetgin, M.K.; Yazici, D.; Cingi, A.; Sargin, M.; Unal, S.; Iseri, C.; Mahmutoglu, F.S.; Yumuk, V.D.","Purpose of Review: The proposed expert opinion was prepared by a panel of obesity and law specialists from Turkey to review the utility of telemedicine in obesity care and to provide a guidance document with recommendations on a hybrid multidisciplinary integrated care follow-up algorithm and the legislation governing telemedicine practice to assist obesity specialists in practicing the telemedicine. Recent Findings: The efficacy and feasibility of telemedicine interventions in supporting obesity management programs even during pandemics confirm that obesity is a particularly well-suited field for telemedicine, emphasizing the strong likelihood of continued utilization of telemedicine in obesity management, beyond the pandemic period. Summary: Telemedicine has great potential to address several barriers to ongoing weight-management care, such as challenges of access to specialized care, cost, and time limitations as well as patient adherence to treatment. However, telemedicine practice should complement rather than replace the in-person visits which are unique in building rapport and offering social support. Accordingly, the participating experts recommend the use of a hybrid integrated care model in the management of obesity, with the use of telemedicine, as an adjunct to in-person visits, to enable the provision of suggested intensive obesity management via frequent visits by a multidisciplinary team of obesity specialists. Further research addressing the utility of telemedicine in terms of optimal modality and duration for successful long-term obesity management outcomes is necessary to develop specific guidelines on telemedicine practice. In addition, the legislation governing the norms and protocols on confidentiality, privacy, access, and liability needs to be improved. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.",2024,,Current Obesity Reports,13,1,167-182,,10.1007/s13679-023-00541-0,,#4966,Bayram 2024,,,0
The Earth is Flat because...: Investigating LLMs' Belief towards Misinformation via Persuasive Conversation,"Xu, R.; Lin, B.S.; Yang, S.; Zhang, T.; Shi, W.; Fang, Z.; Xu, W.; Qiu, H.","Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one. Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,1,,16259-16303,,10.18653/v1/2024.acl-long.858,,#4967,Xu 2024,,,0
Symbiotic Conversational Recommender Systems: A New Approach to Improving Transparency and Persuasion,"Petruzzelli, A.","This project proposal explores the concept of human-machine symbiosis within conversational recommender systems (CRSs), aiming to develop CRSs that are more transparent, and persuasive and can better support users in decision-making tasks. One way to equip CRSs with these capabilities is by making use of the potential of large language models (LLMs). The research focuses on three main research directions: (1) integrating knowledge into LLMs to optimize their recommendation capabilities in CRSs; (2) exploring new ways to fine-tune a pre-trained model for conversational recommendations, without forgetting the knowledge it has already learned; (3) evaluating the impact of an LLM-based CRS on users in terms of transparency, engagement, and persuasion. Through this research, the aim is to overcome limitations in current CRS approaches and develop a more collaborative and user-centric recommendation system. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its author.",2024,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3670,,,,,,#4968,Petruzzelli 2024,,,0
Prove Your Point!: Bringing Proof-Enhancement Principles to Argumentative Essay Generation,"Xiao, R.; Wu, L.; Gou, Y.; Zhang, W.; Liu, T.","Argumentative essay generation (AEG) aims to generate complete texts on specific controversial topics or debates.Although current AEG methods can generate individual opinions, they often overlook the high-level connections between these opinions.This often leads to the generated results being mired in logical confusion, unable to proof their own arguments effectively.The generated essay may present evidence that contradicts the claims or they may fail to assemble the claims into logical flow.In this paper, we present a unified two-stage framework: Proof-Enhancement and Self-Annotation (PESA) for AEG with a focus on logical enhancement.Specifically, we first construct pseudo-labels for logical information,claims and grounds, using a large language model.We then propose a tree planning approach that introduces proof principles and ensures logical consistency.Extensive experimental results show that, benefiting from proof principle guidance, PESA generates argumentative essays with better logical validity and persuasiveness than strong baseline models. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings of the Conference",,,18995-19008,,10.18653/v1/2024.emnlp-main.1058,,#4969,Xiao 2024,,,0
Uncovering Differences in Persuasive Language in Russian versus English Wikipedia,"Li, B.; Panasyuk, A.; Callison-Burch, C.","We study how differences in persuasive language across Wikipedia articles, written in either English and Russian, can uncover each culture’s distinct perspective on different subjects. We develop a large language model (LLM) powered system to identify instances of persuasive language in multilingual texts. Instead of directly prompting LLMs to detect persuasion, which is subjective and difficult, we propose to reframe the task to instead ask high-level questions (HLQs) which capture different persuasive aspects. Importantly, these HLQs are authored by LLMs themselves. LLMs over-generate a large set of HLQs, which are subsequently filtered to a small set aligned with human labels for the original task. We then apply our approach to a large-scale, bilingual dataset of Wikipedia articles (88K total), using a two-stage identify-then-extract prompting strategy to find instances of persuasion. We quantify the amount of persuasion per article, and explore the differences in persuasion through several experiments on the paired articles. Notably, we generate rankings of articles by persuasion in both languages. These rankings match our intuitions on the culturally-salient subjects; Russian Wikipedia highlights subjects on Ukraine, while English Wikipedia highlights the Middle East. Grouping subjects into larger topics, we find politically-related events contain more persuasion than others. We further demonstrate that HLQs obtain similar performance when posed in either English or Russian. Our methodology enables cross-lingual, cross-cultural understanding at scale, and we release our code, prompts, and data. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,"WikiNLP 2024 - 1st Workshop on Advancing Natural Language Processing for Wikipedia, Proceedings of the Workshop",,,21-35,,,,#4970,Li 2024,,,0

Disinformation Detection: An Evolving Challenge in the Age of LLMs,"Jiang, B.; Tan, Z.; Nirmal, A.; Liu, H.","The advent of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has catalyzed transformative advancements across multiple domains. However, alongside these advancements, they have also introduced potential threats. One critical concern is the misuse of LLMs by disinformation spreaders, leveraging these models to generate highly persuasive yet misleading content that challenges the disinformation detection system. This work aims to address this issue by answering three research questions: (1) To what extent can the current disinformation detection technique reliably detect LLM-generated disinformation? (2) If traditional techniques prove less effective, can LLMs themself be exploited to serve as a robust defense against advanced disinformation? and, (3) Should both these strategies falter, what novel approaches can be proposed to counter this burgeoning threat effectively? A holistic exploration for the formation and detection of disinformation is conducted to foster this line of research.

Behavioral Nudging With Generative AI for Content Development in SMS Health Care Interventions: Case Study,"Harrison, R.M.; Lapteva, E.; Bibin, A.","Background: Brief message interventions have demonstrated immense promise in health care, yet the development of these messages has suffered from a dearth of transparency and a scarcity of publicly accessible data sets. Moreover, the researcher-driven content creation process has raised resource allocation issues, necessitating a more efficient and transparent approach to content development. Objective: This research sets out to address the challenges of content development for SMS interventions by showcasing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for content creation, transparently explaining the prompt design and content generation process, and providing the largest publicly available data set of brief messages and source code for future replication of our process. Methods: Leveraging the pretrained large language model GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), we generate a collection of messages in the context of medication adherence for individuals with type 2 diabetes using evidence-derived behavior change techniques identified in a prior systematic review. We create an attributed prompt designed to adhere to content (readability and tone) and SMS (character count and encoder type) standards while encouraging message variability to reflect differences in behavior change techniques. Results: We deliver the most extensive repository of brief messages for a singular health care intervention and the first library of messages crafted with generative AI. In total, our method yields a data set comprising 1150 messages, with 89.91% (n=1034) meeting character length requirements and 80.7% (n=928) meeting readability requirements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that all messages exhibit diversity comparable to an existing publicly available data set created under the same theoretical framework for a similar setting. Conclusions: This research provides a novel approach to content creation for health care interventions using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. Future research is needed to assess the generated content for ethical, safety, and research standards, as well as to determine whether the intervention is successful in improving the target behaviors. © Rachel M Harrison, Ekaterina Lapteva, Anton Bibin.

Developing Personalized Marketing Service Using Generative AI,"Lee, G.H.; Lee, K.J.; Jeong, B.; Kim, T.","In today's world, the development of social network services (SNS) like Facebook and Instagram has enabled consumers to acquire information about products through various channels. The acquisition of diverse information has led to a diversification in consumer preferences and requirements. As consumer preferences diversify and online channels expand, there is an increasing need for companies to provide personalized marketing. Among the means of personalized marketing, personalized marketing messages are a key tool that can enhance customer engagement. However, a limitation of personalized marketing message services is the cost issue associated with manually writing individual marketing messages for personalization. To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically. In this study, we propose the Persuasive Message Intelligence (PMI) service, which utilizes the recently prominent Large Language Model for automated individual personalized marketing messages. PMI generates marketing messages through prompt engineering based on the theory of persuasion in marketing and prior research on AI-generated messages, and validates the elements of prompts through surveys. The trial and error of researchers presented in this study, along with the know-how and rules of prompt engineering, will serve as guidelines for those who wish to develop services through prompts in the future.  © 2013 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Access,12,,22394-22402,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3361946,,#4977,Lee 2024,,,0
Debating with More Persuasive LLMs Leads to More Truthful Answers,"Khan, A.; Hughes, J.; Valentine, D.; Ruis, L.; Sachan, K.; Radhakrishnan, A.; Grefenstette, E.; Bowman, S.R.; Rocktäschel, T.; Perez, E.","Common methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviour heavily rely on human-labelled data. However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information but are otherwise as capable. The method we evaluate is debate, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. On the QuALITY comprehension task, we find that debate consistently helps both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth.

Evaluating Intention Detection Capability of Large Language Models in Persuasive Dialogues,"Sakurai, H.; Miyao, Y.","We investigate intention detection in persuasive multi-turn dialogues employing the largest available Large Language Models (LLMs). Much of the prior research measures the intention detection capability of machine learning models without considering the conversational history.

It is crucial to consider others' perspectives through their utterances when engaging in a persuasive conversation, especially when making a request or reply that is inconvenient for others. This feature makes the persuasive dialogue suitable for the dataset of measuring intention detection capability.

Leveraging Generative Large Language Models for Optimizing Sales Arguments Creation: An Evaluation of GPT-4 Capabilities,"Elhissoufi, M.; Nfaoui, E.H.; Alla, L.; Elghalfiki, J.","A new era in Generative Artificial Intelligence has begun with the release of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have shown significant potential in marketing. Essentially, they have been redefining sales practices and changing sales funnel steps. Despite their promise and persuasive capabilities, there remains a dearth of comprehensive understanding regarding the capabilities of LLMs in generating sales arguments, which is a task traditionally characterized by high costs, time consumption, subjective biases, and the need for considerable expertise and skills. In this study, we take the first step towards exploring the ability of LLMs to generate sales arguments. To this end, we evaluated GPT-4 as one of the most capable LLMs to date in performing zero-shot sales argument creation from product features. We created a dataset containing textual descriptions of features extracted from brochures, catalogs, and technical data sheets of various products of a global company specializing in the manufacturing and retailing of furniture, appliances, and home accessories. We conducted a human evaluation with five experts, covering three main criteria of argument quality, namely coherence, persuasiveness, and relevance. The experimental results revealed the remarkable ability of GPT-4 to generate high-quality and well-structured sales arguments according to the Feature-Advantage-Benefit method. Over 98% of the evaluated arguments were coherent and persuasive. Regarding relevance, the model exhibited an accuracy of 91.53% to align the generated arguments to customers’ purchase motives, namely security, vanity, novelty, comfort, money, and likability. These findings could lead to significant time and cost reductions, allowing the sales force to focus on higher-value tasks.

Developing a ChatGPT-Based Text Extraction Model to Analyze Effective Communication Elements in Pandemic-Related Social Q&A Responses,"Moon, H.; Bae, B.J.; Bae, S.","The present study attempts to use the large language model (LLM) to create a model that identifies Aristotle's rhetorical principles-ethos (source credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logic)-in response to COVID-19 information on a question-And-Answer community (social Q&A platform). The model differentiates between the most upvoted and random answers to analyze the presence of subdimensions of these rhetorical principles. The research utilized answers to COVID-19 questions on Naver Knowledge-iN, the most popular social Q&A platform in South Korea. A set of 193 answer pairs was randomly selected for training (135 pairs) and testing (58 pairs). These answers were coded for the three rhetorical principles and their subdimensions by researchers, which were used to refine models based on GPT 3.5 technology.

Can biased search results change people’s opinions about anything at all? a close replication of the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME),"Epstein, R.; Li, J.","In previous experiments we have conducted on the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), we have focused on the ability of biased search results to shift voting preferences. In three new experiments with a total of 1, 137 US residents (mean age = 33.2), we sought to determine whether biased search rankings could shift people’s opinions on topics that do not involve candidates or elections. Each of the new experiments looked at a different topic, and participants were pre-screened to make sure they didn’t have strong opinions about these topics. The topics were: Is artificial intelligence useful or dangerous? Is fracking helpful or dangerous? And: Are people born gay or do they choose to be gay? All participants were first asked various demographic questions, then shown brief summaries of the “pro” and “anti” views on each topic, and then asked their opinions about each topic. Next, participants were allowed to conduct an online search using our mock search engine (Kadoodle) lasting up to 15 minutes. In each experiment, one-third of the participants saw biased search results favoring one perspective; one-third saw biased search results favoring the opposing perspective; and one-third (the control group) saw mixed search results. After completing their search, participants were again asked for their opinions about the topic. Our primary dependent variable was Manipulation Power (MP), the percentage increase in the number of participants favoring one viewpoint after having viewed search rankings favoring that viewpoint. The MPs in the three experiments were 25.0%, 30.9%, and 17.8%, respectively. Corresponding shifts were also found for how persuasive participants found each viewpoint to be and for how much they trusted each viewpoint.

WHEN AND HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUGMENTS EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY,"Jia, N.; Luo, X.; Fang, Z.; Liao, C.","Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI–human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees’ creativity in answering customers’ questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees’ interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills. © 2024 Academy of Management.

Validation of a Design Architecture to Deliver Health Management and Behavior Change Evidence at Scale,"Li, A.; Dayomi, M.; Graili, P.; Balouchi, A.; Guergachi, A.; Keshavjee, K.","Forty-four percent of Canadians over the age of 20 have a non-communicable disease (NCD). Millions of Canadians are at risk of developing the complications of NCDs; millions have already experienced those complications. Fortunately, the evidence base for NCD prevention and behavior change is large and growing and digital technologies can deliver them at scale and with high fidelity. However, the current model of in-person primary care is not designed nor capable of operationalizing that evidence. New developments in artificial intelligence that can predict who will develop NCD or the complications of NCD are increasingly available, making the challenge of delivering disease prevention even more urgent. This paper presents findings from stakeholder engagement on a design architecture to address three initial barriers to large-scale deployment of health management and behavior change evidence: 1) the challenges of regulating mobile health apps, 2) the challenge of creating a value-based rationale for payers to invest in deploying mobile health apps at scale, and 3) the high cost of customer acquisition for delivering mobile health apps to those at risk.  © 2024 The Authors.",2024,,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,312,,112-117,,10.3233/SHTI231323,,#4995,Li 2024,,,0
Decomposing Argumentative Essay Generation via Dialectical Planning of Complex Reasoning,"He, Y.; Bao, J.; Sun, Y.; Liang, B.; Yang, M.; Qin, B.; Xu, R.","Argumentative Essay Generation (AEG) is a challenging task in computational argumentation, where detailed logical reasoning and effective rhetorical skills are essential. Previous methods on argument generation typically involve planning prior to generation. However, the planning strategies in these methods overlook the exploration of the logical reasoning process. Inspired by argument structure-related theories, we propose an argumentative planning strategy for prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality essays. This strategy comprises two stages: (1) Sketch planning, which creates a rough outline of the essay, and (2) Dialectical planning, which refines the outline through critical self-reflection. Such a planning strategy enables LLMs to write argumentative essays that are more logical, diverse, and persuasive. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of existing AEG datasets, we construct three new datasets. These datasets are from two domains: exam essays and news editorials, covering both Chinese and English. Automatic and manual evaluation on four datasets show that our method can generate more dialectical and persuasive essays with higher diversity compared to several strong baselines. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,,,12305-12322,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-acl.731,,#4996,He 2024,,,0
BUST: Benchmark for the evaluation of detectors of LLM-Generated Text,"Cornelius, J.; Lithgow, O.; Mitrović, S.; Dolamić, L.; Rinaldi, F.","We introduce BUST, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate detectors of texts generated by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous benchmarks, our focus lies on evaluating the performance of detector systems, acknowledging the inevitable influence of the underlying tasks and different LLM generators. Our benchmark dataset consists of 25K texts from humans and 7 LLMs responding to instructions across 10 tasks from 3 diverse sources. Using the benchmark, we evaluated 5 detectors and found substantial performance variance across tasks. A meta-analysis of the dataset characteristics was conducted to guide the examination of detector performance. The dataset was analyzed using diverse metrics assessing linguistic features like fluency and coherence, readability scores, and writer attitudes, such as emotions, convincingness, and persuasiveness. Features impacting detector performance were investigated with surrogate models, revealing emotional content in texts enhanced some detectors, yet the most effective detector demonstrated consistent performance, irrespective of writer’s attitudes and text styles. Our approach focused on investigating relationships between the detectors’ performance and two key factors: text characteristics and LLM generators. We believe BUST will provide valuable insights into selecting detectors tailored to specific text styles and tasks and facilitate a more practical and in-depth investigation of detection systems for LLM-generated text. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,"Proceedings of the 2024 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, NAACL 2024",1,,8022-8050,,10.18653/v1/2024.naacl-long.444,,#4997,Cornelius 2024,,,0
Beyond Persuasion: Towards Conversational Recommender System with Credible Explanations,"Qin, P.; Huang, C.; Deng, Y.; Lei, W.; Chua, T.-S.","With the aid of large language models, current conversational recommender system (CRS) has gaining strong abilities to persuade users to accept recommended items. While these CRSs are highly persuasive, they can mislead users by incorporating incredible information in their explanations, ultimately damaging the long-term trust between users and the CRS. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, called PC-CRS, to enhance the credibility of CRS's explanations during persuasion. It guides the explanation generation through our proposed credibility-aware persuasive strategies and then gradually refines explanations via post-hoc self-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of PC-CRS in promoting persuasive and credible explanations.

The workshop categories “initiation and implementation, barriers to adoption and utilization, and data usage” were integrated for each level. Results: At the macro-level, policy development could encourage data sharing and international collaboration, including the exchange of SM methods, supportive care models, and self-management modules. At the meso-level, institutions should adjust clinical workflow and service delivery and promote a thorough technical and clinical integration of SM. At the micro-level, SM should be individualized, with timely feedback for patients, and should foster trust and understanding of AI decision support tools amongst clinicians to improve supportive care.

Grounding neuroscience in behavioral changes using artificial neural networks,"Lindsay, G.W.","Connecting neural activity to function is a common aim in neuroscience. How to define and conceptualize function, however, can vary. Here I focus on grounding this goal in the specific question of how a given change in behavior is produced by a change in neural circuits or activity. Artificial neural network models offer a particularly fruitful format for tackling such questions because they use neural mechanisms to perform complex transformations and produce appropriate behavior. Therefore, they can be a means of causally testing the extent to which a neural change can be responsible for an experimentally observed behavioral change. Furthermore, because the field of interpretability in artificial intelligence has similar aims, neuroscientists can look to interpretability methods for new ways of identifying neural features that drive performance and behaviors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2024,,Current Opinion in Neurobiology,84,,,,10.1016/j.conb.2023.102816,,#5001,Lindsay 2024,,,0

"Chatbot ads with a human touch: A test of anthropomorphism, interactivity, and narrativity","Sun, Y.; Chen, J.; Sundar, S.S.","Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are increasingly capable of simulating human-like conversations. But, is this desirable for strategic communications? Will chatbots be more persuasive if they are more human-like, not only in their appearance but also in their interaction and delivery of advertising content? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by mitigating violated expectancy. Narrative ads promote chatbot advertising through perceived transportation. A three-way interaction revealed that when a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence.

The Effects of an Ethics Education Program on Artificial Intelligence among Middle School Students: Analysis of Perception and Attitude Changes,"Choi, J.-I.; Yang, E.; Goo, E.-H.","Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought convenience to human lives, but its pervasive impact extends beyond individuals, affecting society as a whole. Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI. The implications of this study are significant for the field of AI education. © 2024 by the authors.",2024,,Applied Sciences (Switzerland),14,4,,,10.3390/app14041588,,#5008,Choi 2024,,,0
"WIP: Beyond Code: Evaluating ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and Meta AI as AI Tutors in Computer Science and Engineering Education","Nath, S.; Yoon, S.Y.","This Work-in-Progress research paper evaluates the validity of Large Language Models (LLMs) as conversational AI tutors for computer science learning. While current engineering education literature has predominantly emphasized the rapid evolution of LLMs as conversational AI tutors for programming languages, the exploration into their effectiveness within general STEM topics remains comparatively scarce. This WIP study thus centers on evaluating the potential of LLMs to facilitate understanding of core hardware design concepts critical to computer science and engineering (CSE) education. By cross-checking the responses from generative AI chatbots to an openended CSE-based question, we aimed to uncover how LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI, can contribute to teaching and learning of general CSE courses instead of a specifically coding-based one. Our method involved simulating a student query on the popular debate between CISC vs. RISC related to computer architecture and analyzing the chatbots' responses. This initial collection of data served as the foundation for a continual comparative analysis aimed at determining the inherent instructional value of each LLM and its validity and reliability. To systematically assess the responses, we introduced an evaluation framework focusing on metrics, such as response accuracy, persuasiveness, and depth of explanation. The current work anticipates not only enriching our understanding of how these advanced LLMs can support general CSE education but also identifying areas where further development is needed for a more holistic integration of LLM-based chatbots in assisting student comprehension in the overarching engineering education. © 2024 IEEE.",2024,,"Proceedings - Frontiers in Education Conference, FIE",,,,,10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10893528,,#5009,Nath 2024,,,0

Do Metadata and Appearance of the Retrieved Webpages Affect LLM’s Reasoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation?,"Chiang, C.-H.; Lee, H.-Y.","Large language models (LLMs) answering questions with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can face conflicting evidence in the retrieved documents. While prior works study how textual features like perplexity and readability influence the persuasiveness of evidence, humans consider more than textual content when evaluating conflicting information on the web. In this paper, we focus on the following question: When two webpages contain conflicting information to answer a question, does non-textual information affect the LLM’s reasoning and answer? We consider three types of non-textual information: (1) the webpage’s publication time, (2) the source where the webpage is from, and (3) the appearance of the webpage. We give the LLM a Yes/No question and two conflicting webpages that support yes and no, respectively. We exchange the non-textual information in the two webpages to see if the LLMs tend to use the information from a newer, more reliable, and more visually appealing webpage. We find that changing the publication time of the webpage can change the answer for most LLMs, but changing the webpage’s source merely changes the LLM’s answer. We also reveal that the webpage’s appearance has a strong causal effect on Claude-3’s answers.

"Measuring digital intervention user experience with a novel ecological momentary assessment (EMA) method, CORTO","Lukka, L.; Karhulahti, V.-M.; Bergman, V.-R.; Palva, J.M.","Digital interventions often suffer from low usage, which may reflect insufficient attention to user experience. Moreover, the existing evaluation methods have limited applicability in the remote study of user experience of complex interventions that have expansive content and that are used over an extensive period of time. To alleviate these challenges, we describe here a novel qualitative Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) method: the CORTO method (Contextual, One-item, Repeated, Timely, Open-ended). We used it to gather digital intervention user experience data from Finnish adults (n = 184) who lived with interview-confirmed major depressive disorder (MDD) and took part in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that studied the efficacy of a novel 12-week game-based digital intervention for depression. A second dataset on user experience was gathered with retrospective interviews (n = 22). We inductively coded the CORTO method and retrospective interview data, which led to four user experience categories: (1) contextual use, (2) interaction-elicited emotional experience, (3) usability, and (4) technical issues. Then, we used the created user experience categories and Template Analysis to analyze both datasets together, and reported the results qualitatively. Finally, we compared the two datasets with each other. We found that the data generated with the CORTO method offered more insights into usability and technical categories than the interview data that particularly illustrated the contextual use. The emotional valence of the interview data was more positive compared with the CORTO data. Both the CORTO and interview data detected 55 % of the micro-level categories; 20 % of micro-level categories were only detected by the CORTO data and 25 % only by the interview data. We found that the during-intervention user experience measurement with the CORTO method can provide intervention-specific insights, and thereby further the iterative user-centered intervention development. Overall, these findings highlight the impact of evaluation methods on the categories and qualities of insights acquired in intervention research. © 2024 The Authors",2024,,Internet Interventions,35,,,,10.1016/j.invent.2023.100706,,#5019,Lukka 2024,,,0
AI-Powered AOP: Enhancing Runtime Monitoring with Large Language Models and Statistical Learning,"AlSobeh, A.; Shatnawi, A.; Al-Ahmad, B.; Aljmal, A.; Khamaiseh, S.","Modern software systems must adapt to dynamic artificial intelligence (AI) environments and evolving requirements. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) effectively isolates crosscutting concerns (CCs) into single modules called aspects, enhancing quality metrics, and simplifying testing. However, AOP implementation can lead to unexpected program outputs and behavior changes. This paper proposes an AI-enhanced, adaptive monitoring framework for validating program behaviors during aspect weaving that integrates AOP interfaces (AOPIs) with large language models (LLMs), i.e. GPT-Codex AI, to dynamically generate and optimize monitoring aspects and statistical models in realtime. This enables intelligent run-time analysis, adaptive model checking, and natural language (NL) interaction. We tested the framework on ten diverse Java classes from JHotdraw 7.6 by extracting context and numerical data and building a dataset for analysis. By dynamically refining aspects and models based on observed behavior, its results showed that the framework maintained the integrity of the Java OOP class while providing predictive insights into potential conflicts and optimizations. Results demonstrate the framework’s efficacy in detecting subtle behavioral changes induced by aspect weaving, with a 94% accuracy in identifying potential conflicts and a 37% reduction in false positives compared to traditional static analysis techniques. Furthermore, the integration of explainable AI provides developers with clear, actionable explanations for flagged behaviors through NL interfaces, enhancing interpretability and trust in the system. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

Would You Like to Make a Donation? A Dialogue System to Persuade You to Donate,"Song, Y.; Wang, H.","Persuasive dialogue is a type of dialogue commonly used in human daily life in scenarios such as promotion and sales. Its purpose is to influence the decision, attitude or behavior of another person through the dialogue process. Persuasive automated dialogue systems can be applied in a variety of fields such as charity, business, education, and healthcare. Regardless of their amazing abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT still have limitations in persuasion. There is few research dedicated to persuasive dialogue in the current research of automated dialogue systems. In this paper, we introduce a persuasive automated dialogue system. In the system, a context-aware persuasion strategy selection module makes dialogue system flexibly use different persuasion strategies to persuade users; Then a natural language generation module is used to output a response. We also propose a persuasiveness prediction model to automatically evaluate the persuasiveness of generated text. Experimental results show that our dialogue system can achieve better performance on several automated evaluation metrics than baseline models. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.",2024,,"2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC-COLING 2024 - Main Conference Proceedings",,,17707-17717,,,,#5024,Song 2024,,,0
Applications of digital health approaches for cardiometabolic diseases prevention and management in the Western Pacific region,"Liang, F.; Yang, X.; Peng, W.; Zhen, S.; Cao, W.; Li, Q.; Xiao, Z.; Gong, M.; Wang, Y.; Gu, D.","Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are the major types of non-communicable diseases, contributing to huge disease burdens in the Western Pacific region (WPR). The use of digital health (dHealth) technologies, such as wearable gadgets, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence (AI), facilitates interventions for CMDs prevention and treatment. Currently, most studies on dHealth and CMDs in WPR were conducted in a few high- and middle-income countries like Australia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. Evidence indicated that dHealth services promoted early prevention by behavior interventions, and AI-based innovation brought automated diagnosis and clinical decision-support. dHealth brought facilitators for the doctor-patient interplay in the effectiveness, experience, and communication skills during healthcare services, with rapidly development during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. In the future, the improvement of dHealth services in WPR needs to gain more policy support, enhance technology innovation and privacy protection, and perform cost-effectiveness research. © 2023",2024,,The Lancet Regional Health - Western Pacific,43,,,,10.1016/j.lanwpc.2023.100817,,#5025,Liang 2024,,,0
UMUTeam at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Multimodal Identification of Persuasive Techniques in Memes through Large Language Models,"Pan, R.; García-Díaz, J.A.; Valencia-García, R.","In this manuscript we describe the UMUTeam's participation in SemEval-2024 Task 4, a shared task to identify different persuasion techniques in memes. The task is divided into three subtasks. One is a multimodal subtask of identifying whether a meme contains persuasion or not. The others are hierarchical multi-label classifications that consider textual content alone or a multimodal setting of text and visual content. This is a multilingual task, and we participated in all three subtasks but we focus only on the English dataset. Our approach is based on a fine-tuning approach with the pre-trained RoBERTa-large model. In addition, for multimodal cases with both textual and visual content, we used the LMM called LlaVa to extract image descriptions and combine them with the meme text. Our system performed well in three subtasks, achieving the tenth best result with an Hierarchical F1 of 64.774%, the fourth best in Subtask 2a with an Hierarchical F1 of 69.003%, and the eighth best in Subtask 2b with a Macro F1 of 78.660%. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,"SemEval 2024 - 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, Proceedings of the Workshop",,,655-666,,,,#5026,Pan 2024,,,0
Mobile health (m-health) smartphone interventions for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity,"Metzendorf, M.-I.; Wieland, L.S.; Richter, B.","Background: Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for various diseases, and its incidence has tripled worldwide since 1975. In addition to potentially being at risk for adverse health outcomes, people with overweight or obesity are often stigmatised. Behaviour change interventions are increasingly delivered as mobile health (m-health) interventions, using smartphone apps and wearables. They are believed to support healthy behaviours at the individual level in a low-threshold manner. Objectives: To assess the effects of integrated smartphone applications for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 2 October 2023 (date of last search for all databases). We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. Selection criteria: Participants were adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Eligible interventions were integrated smartphone apps using at least two behaviour change techniques. The intervention could target physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight loss, healthy diet, or self-efficacy. Comparators included no or minimal intervention (NMI), a different smartphone app, personal coaching, or usual care. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of any duration with a follow-up of at least three months. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodology and the RoB 2 tool. Important outcomes were physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and weight, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, well-being, change in dietary behaviour, and adverse events. We focused on presenting studies with medium- (6 to < 12 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) outcomes in our summary of findings table, following recommendations in the core outcome set for behavioural weight management interventions. Main results: We included 18 studies with 2703 participants. Interventions lasted from 2 to 24 months. The mean BMI in adults ranged from 27 to 50, and the median BMI z-score in adolescents ranged from 2.2 to 2.5. Smartphone app versus no or minimal intervention. Thirteen studies compared a smartphone app versus NMI in adults; no studies were available for adolescents. The comparator comprised minimal health advice, handouts, food diaries, smartphone apps unrelated to weight loss, and waiting list. Measures of physical activity: at 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app compared to NMI probably reduces moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) slightly (mean difference (MD) −28.9 min/week (95% confidence interval (CI) −85.9 to 28; 1 study, 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence)). We are very uncertain about the results of estimated energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness at eight months' follow-up. A smartphone app compared with NMI probably results in little to no difference in changes in total activity time at 12 months' follow-up and leisure time physical activity at 24 months' follow-up. Anthropometric measures: a smartphone app compared with NMI may reduce BMI (MD of BMI change −2.6 kg/m2, 95% CI −6 to 0.8; 2 studies, 146 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at six to eight months' follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain. At 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in BMI change (MD −0.1 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.4 to 0.3; 1 study; 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in body weight change (MD −2.5 kg, 95% CI −6.8 to 1.7; 3 studies, 1044 participants; low-certainty evidence) at 12 months' follow-up. At 24 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in body weight change (MD 0.7 kg, 95% CI −1.2 to 2.6; 1 study, 245 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in self-efficacy for a physical activity score at eight months' follow-up, but the results are very uncertain. A smartphone app probably results in little to no difference in quality of life and well-being at 12 months (moderate-certainty evidence) and in little to no difference in various measures used to inform dietary behaviour at 12 and 24 months' follow-up. We are very uncertain about adverse events, which were only reported narratively in two studies (very low-certainty evidence). Smartphone app versus another smartphone app. Two studies compared different versions of the same app in adults, showing no or minimal differences in outcomes. One study in adults compared two different apps (calorie counting versus ketogenic diet) and suggested a slight reduction in body weight at six months in favour of the ketogenic diet app. No studies were available for adolescents. Smartphone app versus personal coaching. Only one study compared a smartphone app with personal coaching in adults, presenting data at three months. Two studies compared these interventions in adolescents. A smartphone app resulted in little to no difference in BMI z-score compared to personal coaching at six months' follow-up (MD 0, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.2; 1 study; 107 participants). Smartphone app versus usual care. Only one study compared an app with usual care in adults but only reported data at three months on participant satisfaction. No studies were available for adolescents. We identified 34 ongoing studies. Authors' conclusions: The available evidence is limited and does not demonstrate a clear benefit of smartphone applications as interventions for adolescents or adults with overweight or obesity. While the number of studies is growing, the evidence remains incomplete due to the high variability of the apps' features, content and components, which complicates direct comparisons and assessment of their effectiveness. Comparisons with either no or minimal intervention or personal coaching show minor effects, which are mostly not clinically significant. Minimal data for adolescents also warrants further research. Evidence is also scarce for low- and middle-income countries as well as for people with different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. The 34 ongoing studies suggest sustained interest in the topic, with new evidence expected to emerge within the next two years. In practice, clinicians and healthcare practitioners should carefully consider the potential benefits, limitations, and evolving research when recommending smartphone apps to adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity.

Don’t Forget the Humble Text Message: 25 Years of Text Messaging in Health,"Dobson, R.; Whittaker, R.; Abroms, L.C.; Bramley, D.; Free, C.; McRobbie, H.; Stowell, M.; Rodgers, A.","Since the early studies exploring the use of SMS text messaging for health intervention, text messaging has played a pivotal role in the advancement of mobile health. As an intervention modality, text messaging has provided vital learnings for the design and delivery of interventions, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite the advances in technology over the last 25 years, text messaging is still being used in largely the same way to deliver health information, behavior change interventions, and support. The strong, consistent evidence for the benefits of this type of intervention has made text messaging a routine part of health interventions around the world. Key to its success is its simplicity, alongside the benefit of being arguably the most accessible form of consumer digital health intervention. Text message interventions are well suited for public health interventions due to their low cost, vast reach, frequent use, high read rates, and ability to be tailored and personalized. Furthermore, the nature of text messaging interventions makes them ideal for the delivery of multilingual, culturally tailored interventions, which is important in the context of increasing cultural diversity in many countries internationally. Indeed, studies assessing text message–based health interventions have shown them to be effective across sociodemographic and ethnic groups and have led to their adoption into national-level health promotion programs. With a growing focus on artificial intelligence, robotics, sensors, and other advances in digital health, there is an opportunity to integrate these technologies into text messaging programs. Simultaneously, it is essential that equity remains at the forefront for digital health researchers, developers, and implementers. Ensuring digital health solutions address inequities in health experienced across the world while taking action to maximize digital inclusion will ensure the true potential of digital health is realized. Text messaging has the potential to continue to play a pivotal role in the delivery of equitable digital health tools to communities around the world for many years to come. Further new technologies can build on the humble text message, leveraging its success to advance the field of digital health. This Viewpoint presents a retrospective of text messaging in health, drawing on the example of text message–based interventions for smoking cessation, and presents evidence for the continued relevance of this mobile health modality in 2025 and beyond. ©Rosie Dobson, Robyn Whittaker, Lorien C Abroms, Dale Bramley, Caroline Free, Hayden McRobbie, Melanie Stowell, Anthony Rodgers.",2024,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,26,,,,10.2196/59888,,#5033,Dobson 2024,,,0
Persuasive Determinants of Physical Activity in Adults: Cultural Differences and the Moderating Effect of Gender and Age,"Almutari, N.; Alslaity, A.; Orji, R.","Evidence shows that physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. A growing variety of behavioural change interventions have been developed to promote physical activity behaviour, and have shown success. However, most of these apps apply a one-size-fits-all approach focusing on individualistic cultures and neglecting collectivist cultures. We investigate the possible cultural differences between individualism and collectivism on how the behavioral determinants influence people’s physical activity behaviour. We conducted a large-scale study of 430 participants from collectivist and individualist cultures using the extended Health Belief Model (HBM). We also assess the moderating effect of age and gender. We map these determinants to their corresponding persuasive strategies that can be used in operationalizing them in behaviour change applications for promoting physical activity. Our findings show that Social influence and Cue to action are the strongest determinants of physical activity for collectivists. Whereas in individualists, Cue to action, and Self-efficacy are the strongest determinants of physical activity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and offer design guidelines for persuasive interventions that both appeal to a broad audience and are tailored to a particular group depending on their gender and age group. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14699 LNCS,,Mar-27,,10.1007/978-3-031-60898-8_1,,#5034,Almutari 2024,,,0
Towards Automated Planning of Level Structures for Digital Interventions,"James, L.J.; De Pellegrin, E.; Genga, L.; Montagne, B.; Van Gorp, P.; Petrick, R.P.A.","As global populations continue to age and chronic health conditions rise, the demand for scalable, effective rehabilitation interventions is increasing. Digital interventions offer a cost-effective solution for promoting healthy behavior change and self-management. However, traditional methods of handcrafting structured intervention content are time-inefficient, and not scalable. We propose a new approach to content structuring by modeling it as an automated planning problem. This work introduces the Automated Planning of LEvel Systems (APLES) tool, which leverages automated planning to generate structured intervention content within predefined constraints, balancing automation and designer control. APLES addresses the limitations of existing solutions such as Procedural Content Generation (PCG) systems, which often limit creative input. APLES allows designers to set rules that guide the automated processes. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe the technical progress of the APLES tool, including its planning framework and practical application in digital health interventions. Preliminary results demonstrate the tool’s potential to improve efficiency and scalability in content structuring while maintaining alignment with creative goals. In future work, we will evaluate APLES across multiple digital interventions to assess its impact on user engagement compared to structures handcrafted by campaign managers, and its perceived usefulness by healthcare providers. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2024,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3883,,74-88,,,,#5036,James 2024,,,0
"Roles, Users, Benefits, and Limitations of Chatbots in Health Care: Rapid Review","Laymouna, M.; Ma, Y.; Lessard, D.; Schuster, T.; Engler, K.; Lebouché, B.","Background: Chatbots, or conversational agents, have emerged as significant tools in health care, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and digital technology. These programs are designed to simulate human conversations, addressing various health care needs. However, no comprehensive synthesis of health care chatbots' roles, users, benefits, and limitations is available to inform future research and application in the field. Objective: This review aims to describe health care chatbots' characteristics, focusing on their diverse roles in the health care pathway, user groups, benefits, and limitations. Methods: A rapid review of published literature from 2017 to 2023 was performed with a search strategy developed in collaboration with a health sciences librarian and implemented in the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Primary research studies reporting on chatbot roles or benefits in health care were included. Two reviewers dual-screened the search results. Extracted data on chatbot roles, users, benefits, and limitations were subjected to content analysis. Results: The review categorized chatbot roles into 2 themes: delivery of remote health services, including patient support, care management, education, skills building, and health behavior promotion, and provision of administrative assistance to health care providers. User groups spanned across patients with chronic conditions as well as patients with cancer; individuals focused on lifestyle improvements; and various demographic groups such as women, families, and older adults. Professionals and students in health care also emerged as significant users, alongside groups seeking mental health support, behavioral change, and educational enhancement. The benefits of health care chatbots were also classified into 2 themes: improvement of health care quality and efficiency and cost-effectiveness in health care delivery. The identified limitations encompassed ethical challenges, medicolegal and safety concerns, technical difficulties, user experience issues, and societal and economic impacts. Conclusions: Health care chatbots offer a wide spectrum of applications, potentially impacting various aspects of health care. While they are promising tools for improving health care efficiency and quality, their integration into the health care system must be approached with consideration of their limitations to ensure optimal, safe, and equitable use.  ©Moustafa Laymouna, Yuanchao Ma, David Lessard, Tibor Schuster, Kim Engler, Bertrand Lebouché.",2024,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,26,,,,10.2196/56930,,#5038,Laymouna 2024,,,0
"Hmm, the effect of AI conversational fillers on consumer purchase intentions","Liu, G.; Liu, M.W.; Zhu, Q.","AI conversational agents are increasingly prevalent in marketing practices. A recent effort to make AI conversational agents humanlike is the use of conversational fillers, such as uh, um, and hmm. While computer science research has shown that conversational fillers used by AI agents generally improve users’ interactional experiences, their effects in marketing remain unexplored. This research examines AI conversational fillers in a sales and promotion context and shows that they trigger consumers’ suspicion of ulterior motives, thereby decreasing their purchase intentions, an effect moderated by organization type (for-profit vs. nonprofit). We conducted one field experiment and four online experiments with different modalities, products, and languages to provide empirical support for the hypotheses. In so doing, this research contributes to the research on chatbot natural language and AI persuasion by showing that the persuasion knowledge model can come into work in consumers’ interaction with AI agents. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",2024,,Marketing Letters,,,,,10.1007/s11002-024-09760-4,,#5042,Liu 2024,,,0
Virtual education strategies in the context of sustainable health care and medical education: A topic modelling analysis of four decades of research,"Lee, J.; Kim, H.; Kron, F.","Background: The growing importance of sustainability has led to the current literature being saturated with studies on the necessity of, and suggested topics for, education for sustainable health care (ESH). Even so, ESH implementation has been hindered by educator unpreparedness and resource scarcity. A potential resolution lies in virtual education. However, research on the strategies needed for successfully implementing virtual education in the context of sustainable health care and medical education is sparse; this study aims to fill the gap. Methods: Topic modelling, a computational text-mining method for analysing recurring patterns of co-occurring word clusters to reveal key topics prevalent across the texts, was used to examine how sustainability was addressed in research in medicine, medical education, and virtual education. A total of 17 631 studies, retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were analysed. Results: Sustainability-related topics within health care, medical education and virtual education provided systematic implications for Sustainable Virtual Medical Education (SVME)–ESH via virtual platforms in a sustainable way. Analyses of keywords, phrases, topics and their associated networks indicate that SVME should address the three pillars of environmental, social and economic sustainability and medical practices to uphold them; employ different technologies and methods including simulations, virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, distance learning; and implement strategies for collaborative development, persuasive diffusion and quality assurance. Conclusions: This research suggests that sustainable strategies in virtual education for ESH require a systems approach, encompassing components such as learning content and objectives, evaluation, targeted learners, media, methods and strategies. The advancement of SVME necessitates that medical educators and researchers play a central and bridging role, guiding both the fields of sustainable health care and medical education in the development and implementation of SVME. In this way, they can prepare future physicians to address sustainability issues that impact patient care. © 2023 The Authors.

EXPLORING MATERIAL RELATIONS IN THE AI ERA,"Green, C.","Recent evolutions in the accessibility and uptake of generative AI tools have already affected the way design and engineering are taught at university level. The exploration of AI related tools and technologies is increasingly part of formal design study and informal and peer learning. It is however important to place recent evolutions in a longer temporal context. Design activity and education have seen a progressive move away from “thing-based” methods and towards capability, service, experience, and systemic approaches; considering the wider context and impact of design interventions. These evolutions in design and design education create a learning environment where the abstract, virtual and experiential are, in some cases, more present than the material and tangible. This paper proposes a discussion on the importance of addressing materiality and tangible everyday material experience in this evolving context. This paper presents two different “families” of teaching modules that have evolved over a period of five years with a focus on materiality, material relations and touch. While these two modules represent different ways of exploring materials and material relations, they together permit reflection around forms of tangible/material learning activities that may be relevant in future design curricula, and the criteria and qualities these forms of teaching may need to incorporate. © 2024 Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Rise of the Machines: Design Education in the Generative AI Era, E and PDE 2024.

Exploring the Influence of Game Framing and Gamer Types on the Effectiveness of Persuasive Games,"Ndulue, C.; Orji, R.","Although persuasive games are effective at promoting behaviour change, their effectiveness may be influenced by many factors, which include gamer personality type and game framing. This paper explores the relationship between game framing, gamer type and persuasive strategies, focusing on a persuasive game for Healthy Eating. In a between-study of 371 participants, our research revealed that, although the three game-framing versions (gain-framed, loss-framed, and gain-loss-framed) and four persuasive strategies implemented (reward, competition, praise, and suggestion) were perceived as effective, the effectiveness of the reward strategy was significantly different across the game-framing versions. It was more effective in the gain-loss framed version when compared to the other two versions. We also found that the reward strategy had the highest number of significant relationships with the gamer types across all the game framings, while the suggestion strategy showed no significant relationships with the gamer types across all framings. We conclude by discussing the insights from these results and how they affect persuasive game design for game framings and game types. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14636 LNCS,,207-221,,10.1007/978-3-031-58226-4_16,,#5050,Ndulue 2024,,,0

Despite efforts to address bias, historical and contemporary textbooks have been found to perpetuate stereotyped associations: efficient techniques like word embeddings can be used to analyze a wide range of school textbooks to assess the presence of stereotyped biases. In this paper, we use Artificial Intelligence to test what happens if people are exposed to some textbooks or others. Our procedure can be used for in-silico testing of the persuasive power of textbooks. For this purpose, we introduce ChildDM, a model constructed from a corpus of children's free-produced language, and its domain-adapted version, ChildDM-School, trained on a collection of school textbooks. Leveraging the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) framework, we investigate how biases evolve in the language of children after exposition to historical textbooks. While historical textbooks tend to avoid explicit gender-based stereotypes in the scientific and artistic domains, they still conceal biases. Specifically, women are associated with caregiving and family-related activities.  © 2013 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Access,12,,158207-158214,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3413291,,#5053,Ruzzetti 2024,,,0

Optimal Mandatory Lane-Changing Location Planning for CAV Based on Cell Transmission Model,"Gao, G.; Huang, Z.; Ji, W.; Zheng, P.","If dedicate a lane to connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) on a multilane road, the traffic congestion and safety risks remain a major problem but in a different style. Random and disorderly mandatory lane-changing behaviour before approaching the next ramp or intersection would have a disturbing effect on the following vehicles of the traffic flow. This paper mainly establishes the optimal mandatory lane-changing location matching model for each target vehicle in the dedicated CAV lane environment. The aim is to minimizing the total travel time, which could take the disturbing effect into account. This model nests the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe vehicle running. The constraints include the relation between target CAV lane-changing cell and the corresponding behaviour start time, the updating of the flow, and occupancy for varied cells. We use the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the problem. Through the case study of a basic two-lane road scenario in Ningbo, we acquire the convergence results based on the ACO algorithm. Our optimal lane-changing location matching scheme can save 5.9% total travel time when compared to the near-end location lane-changing scheme. We test our model by increasing the total number of upstream input vehicles with 4%, 11%, 15%, and the mandatory lane-changing vehicles with 60%, 200%, respectively. The testing results prove that out optimization method could deal with varied road traffic flow situations. Specifically, when the traffics and mandatory lane-changing vehicles increase, our method could perform better.  © 2024 Gao Gao et al.",2024,,Journal of Advanced Transportation,2024,,,,10.1155/2024/9411726,,#5059,Gao 2024,,,0
The Alzheimer’s Knowledge Base: A Knowledge Graph for Alzheimer Disease Research,"Romano, J.D.; Truong, V.; Kumar, R.; Venkatesan, M.; Graham, B.E.; Hao, Y.; Matsumoto, N.; Li, X.; Wang, Z.; Ritchie, M.D.; Shen, L.; Moore, J.H.","Background: As global populations age and become susceptible to neurodegenerative illnesses, new therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD) are urgently needed. Existing data resources for drug discovery and repurposing fail to capture relationships central to the disease’s etiology and response to drugs. Objective: We designed the Alzheimer’s Knowledge Base (AlzKB) to alleviate this need by providing a comprehensive knowledge representation of AD etiology and candidate therapeutics. Methods: We designed the AlzKB as a large, heterogeneous graph knowledge base assembled using 22 diverse external data sources describing biological and pharmaceutical entities at different levels of organization (eg, chemicals, genes, anatomy, and diseases). AlzKB uses a Web Ontology Language 2 ontology to enforce semantic consistency and allow for ontological inference. We provide a public version of AlzKB and allow users to run and modify local versions of the knowledge base. Results: AlzKB is freely available on the web and currently contains 118,902 entities with 1,309,527 relationships between those entities. To demonstrate its value, we used graph data science and machine learning to (1) propose new therapeutic targets based on similarities of AD to Parkinson disease and (2) repurpose existing drugs that may treat AD. For each use case, AlzKB recovers known therapeutic associations while proposing biologically plausible new ones. Conclusions: AlzKB is a new, publicly available knowledge resource that enables researchers to discover complex translational associations for AD drug discovery. Through 2 use cases, we show that it is a valuable tool for proposing novel therapeutic hypotheses based on public biomedical knowledge. ©Joseph D Romano, Van Truong, Rachit Kumar, Mythreye Venkatesan, Britney E Graham, Yun Hao, Nick Matsumoto, Xi Li, Zhiping Wang, Marylyn D Ritchie, Li Shen, Jason H Moore.",2024,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,26,1,,,10.2196/46777,,#5060,Romano 2024,,,0

Friend or Foe? Conversational Agents in the Digital Workplace and Their Effect on Users’ Stress,"Greulich, R.S.; Wiekenborg, M.; Lichtenberg, S.; Brendel, A.B.; Mirbabaie, M.","Stress in the workplace and the resulting disorders present a significant challenge for the employee, employer, and national economy. According to the transactional model of stress, a possible reduction in stress can be achieved by reevaluating the situation. According to the social response theory, conversational agents should be very suitable for this task, as their increased persuasiveness leads to increased confidence of the user in their abilities. However, the perception of a social agent could also present an additional source of social evaluation stress, i.e., feeling observed and judged by another person. We propose a NeuroIS experiment utilizing EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking to resolve those opposing predictions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Information Systems and Organisation,68,,345-353,,10.1007/978-3-031-58396-4_30,,#5069,Greulich 2024,,,0
Transformation Design Framework for AI-Driven Hyper-performance,"Stibe, A.","Transformation is inevitable, as it drives innovation, compels adaptation, and fosters resilience in changing circumstances. Embracing transformation allows individuals and organizations to remain competitive. Recent technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) accelerate the transformation efforts, thus giving a significant boost to performance. Such conditions require corporations and social leadership to master transformation. To become the drivers of change instead of remaining desperate followers. Therefore, this paper provides a science-driven methodology and practical tools for achieving hyper-performance. The Transformation Design Framework (TDF) empowers organizations and societies to create technology-driven innovations that make behavioral and attitudinal changes last. Managers can now integrate the hyper-performance methodology to transform corporations. The most significant gains are possible in areas with larger behavioral components. Inside organizations, those typically relate to human resources and managerial decision-making. Externally, it can be related to digital marketing, customer relations, consumer behavior, and user experience. This paper outlines the hyper-performance methodology, the TDF containing eight applicable tools, an application example, and three case studies deploying this methodology. It demonstrates how transformation is practical and achievable instead of mystical and complicated. Scholars and professionals are encouraged to expand this understanding by deploying the methodology and attaining hyper-performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14792 LNCS,,220-236,,10.1007/978-3-031-68005-2_16,,#5071,Stibe 2024,,,0
Changing Paradigms in Dementia Care: Technology-Based Solutions,"Mishra, A.; Raut, A.; Samantaray, S.; Rana, A.","Dementia and cognitive impairment remain a major unsolved neuroscience mystery around the global healthcare systems. They are often diagnosed only after the disease has progressed to an advanced stage and starts hampering the daily activities of the individuals. The diagnosis is time-consuming and a series of invasive and non-invasive medical investigations need to be conducted on the patient to arrive at a diagnosis. These examinations and cognitive tests sometimes may fail to give a definitive diagnosis and determine if the dementia is Alzheimer’s disease-related or not. Behavior changes in such aged patients include anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, delusions, psychosis, and many similar manifestations of cognitive impairment. Aged care workers are difficult to recruit and retain owing to the difficulties and long-term stress associated with care services for people with dementia. Moreover, diversity in culture and language also weakens the understanding and relationship between care recipients and care workers. The continuing research on artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical diagnosis and treatment planning is revolutionizing the approach to disease management. Hence for a chronic and intangible disease like dementia, which could be physically and emotionally taxing for both the patients and their caretakers, various AI algorithms and machine learning models could prove promising in early detection, therapy, and care. This article discusses the applications of artificial intelligence and its future scope in the management of neurocognitive impairment and disability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,1057 LNNS,,45-54,,10.1007/978-981-97-4895-2_4,,#5072,Mishra 2024,,,0
Integrated Digital Platforms for Clinical Care,"Vo, L.C.; Pratap, A.; Peters, D.; Larsen, M.E.","Digital platforms can improve patient care, including continuity of care across service providers, and improve outcomes. Electronic health records are widely used within clinical services to document clinical care, and specific applications in mental health care include prompts to develop a suicide safety plan, referrals from general practice for specialist consultations, and standardized risk assessment templates. Digital platforms can also enable communication and engagement with service users across their care. Existing technologies such as text messaging have improved outcomes, with new opportunities emerging from novel platforms such as conversational agents. Beyond the use of these platforms for enhancing communication, advances in smartphone sensors are opening the possibility of digital phenotyping as a method of deriving objective measures of behavior. Such techniques can be used for the early detection of behavior changes, but also for measuring treatment response and the identification of novel cohorts with similar behaviors. Regardless of the mode or functionality of a digital platform, consideration of the human factors and user experience are critical to ensure safety and usage uptake.

A systematic review of artificial intelligence-powered (AI-powered) chatbot intervention for managing chronic illness,"Kurniawan, M.H.; Handiyani, H.; Nuraini, T.; Hariyati, R.T.S.; Sutrisno, S.","Background: Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in chatbots, especially for chronic diseases, has become increasingly prevalent. These AI-powered chatbots serve as crucial tools for enhancing patient communication, addressing the rising prevalence of chronic conditions, and meeting the growing demand for supportive healthcare applications. However, there is a notable gap in comprehensive reviews evaluating the impact of AI-powered chatbot interventions in healthcare within academic literature. This study aimed to assess user satisfaction, intervention efficacy, and the specific characteristics and AI architectures of chatbot systems designed for chronic diseases. Method: A thorough exploration of the existing literature was undertaken by employing diverse databases such as PubMed MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library and Scopus. The studies incorporated in this analysis encompassed primary research that employed chatbots or other forms of AI architecture in the context of preventing, treating or rehabilitating chronic diseases. The assessment of bias risk was conducted using Risk of 2.0 Tools. Results: Seven hundred and eighty-four results were obtained, and subsequently, eight studies were found to align with the inclusion criteria. The intervention methods encompassed health education (n = 3), behaviour change theory (n = 1), stress and coping (n = 1), cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 2) and self-care behaviour (n = 1). The research provided valuable insights into the effectiveness and user-friendliness of AI-powered chatbots in handling various chronic conditions. Overall, users showed favourable acceptance of these chatbots for self-managing chronic illnesses. Conclusions: The reviewed studies suggest promising acceptance of AI-powered chatbots for self-managing chronic conditions. However, limited evidence on their efficacy due to insufficient technical documentation calls for future studies to provide detailed descriptions and prioritize patient safety. These chatbots employ natural language processing and multimodal interaction. Subsequent research should focus on evidence-based evaluations, facilitating comparisons across diverse chronic health conditions. © 2024 The Author(s).

Exploring the Challenges of Behaviour Change Language Classification: A Study on Semi-Supervised Learning and the Impact of Pseudo-Labelled Data,"Meyer, S.; Fernández-Pichel, M.; Elsweiler, D.; Losada, D.E.","Automatic classification of behaviour change language can enhance conversational agents’ capabilities to adjust their behaviour based on users’ current situations and to encourage individuals to make positive changes. However, the lack of annotated language data of change-seekers hampers the performance of existing classifiers. In this study, we investigate the use of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to classify highly imbalanced texts around behaviour change. We assess the impact of including pseudo-labelled data from various sources and examine the balance between the amount of added pseudo-labelled data and the strictness of the inclusion criteria. Our findings indicate that while adding pseudo-labelled samples to the training data has limited classification impact, it does not significantly reduce performance regardless of the source of these new samples.

A Review of Sensor-Based Interventions for Supporting Patient Adherence to Inhalation Therapy,"Ma, J.; Sun, X.; Liu, B.","Purpose: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sensor technologies employed in interventions to enhance patient adherence to inhalation therapy for chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular emphasis on human factors. Sensor-based interventions offer opportunities to improve adherence through monitoring and feedback; however, a deeper understanding of how these technologies interact with patients is essential. Patients and Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ACM Digital Library, spanning the timeframe from January 2014 to December 2023. Our inclusion criteria focused on studies that employed sensor-based technologies to enhance patient adherence to inhalation therapy. Results: The initial search yielded 1563 results. After a thorough screening process, we selected 37 relevant studies. These sensor-based interventions were organized within a comprehensive HFE framework, including data collection, data processing, system feedback, and system feasibility. The data collection phase comprised person-related, task-related, and physical environment-related data. Various approaches to data processing were employed, encompassing applications for assessing intervention effectiveness, monitoring patient behaviour, and identifying disease risks, while system feedback included reminders and alerts, data visualization, and persuasive features. System feasibility was evaluated based on patient acceptance, usability, and device cost considerations. Conclusion: Sensor-based interventions hold significant promise for improving adherence to inhalation therapy. This review high-lights the necessity of an integrated “person-task-physical environment” system to advance future sensor technologies. By capturing comprehensive data on patient health, device usage patterns, and environmental conditions, this approach enables more personalized and effective adherence support.

Galilean resonances: the role of experiment in Turing’s construction of machine intelligence,"Gonçalves, B.","In 1950, Alan Turing proposed his iconic imitation game, calling it a ‘test’, an ‘experiment’, and the ‘the only really satisfactory support’ for his view that machines can think. Following Turing’s rhetoric, the ‘Turing test’ has been widely received as a kind of crucial experiment to determine machine intelligence. In later sources, however, Turing showed a milder attitude towards what he called his ‘imitation tests’. In 1948, Turing referred to the persuasive power of ‘the actual production of machines’ rather than that of a controlled experiment. Observing this, I propose to distinguish the logical structure from the rhetoric of Turing’s argument. I argue that Turing’s proposal of a crucial experiment may have been a concession to meet the standards of his interlocutors more than his own, while his construction of machine intelligence rather reveals a method of successive idealizations and exploratory experiments. I will draw a parallel with Galileo’s construction of idealized fall in a void and the historiographical controversies over the role of experiment in Galilean science. I suggest that Turing, like Galileo, relied on certain kinds of experiment, but also on rhetoric and propaganda to inspire further research that could lead to convincing scientific and technological progress. © 2023 The Author(s).

Reinforcement Learning Interventions on Boundedly Rational Human Agents in Frictionful Tasks,"Nofshin, E.; Swaroop, S.; Pan, W.; Murphy, S.; Doshi-Velez, F.","Many important behavior changes are frictionful; they require individuals to expend effort over a long period with little immediate gratification. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent can provide personalized interventions to help individuals stick to their goals. In these settings, the AI agent must personalize rapidly (before the individual disengages) and interpretably, to help us understand the behavioral interventions. In this paper, we introduce Behavior Model Reinforcement Learning (BMRL), a framework in which an AI agent intervenes on the parameters of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) belonging to a boundedly rational human agent. Our formulation of the human decision-maker as a planning agent allows us to attribute undesirable human policies (ones that do not lead to the goal) to their maladapted MDP parameters, such as an extremely low discount factor. Furthermore, we propose a class of tractable human models that captures fundamental behaviors in frictionful tasks. Introducing a notion of MDP equivalence specific to BMRL, we theoretically and empirically show that AI planning with our human models can lead to helpful policies on a wide range of more complex, ground-truth humans. © 2024 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.",2024,,"Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems, AAMAS",2024-May,,1482-1491,,,,#5091,Nofshin 2024,,,0

A Comprehensive Analysis of Cognitive CAPTCHAs Through Eye Tracking,"Dinh, N.; Ogiela, L.D.; Tran-Trung, K.; Le-Viet, T.; Hoang, V.T.","CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) has long been employed to combat automated bots. It accomplishes this by utilizing distortion techniques and cognitive characteristics. When it comes to countering security attacks, cognitive CAPTCHA methods have proven to be more effective than other approaches. The advancement of eye-tracking technology has greatly improved human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling users to engage with computers without physical contact. This technology is widely used for studying attention, cognitive processes, and performance. In this specific research, we conducted eye-tracking experiments on participants to investigate how their visual behavior changes as the complexity of cognitive CAPTCHAs varies. By analyzing the distribution of eye gaze on each level of CAPTCHA, we can assess users' visual behavior based on eye movement performance and process metrics. The data collected is then employed in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to categorize and examine the relative importance of these factors in predicting performance. This study highlights the potential to enhance any cognitive CAPTCHA model by gaining insights into the underlying cognitive processes.  © 2013 IEEE.",2024,,IEEE Access,12,,47190-47209,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3373542,,#5093,Dinh 2024,,,0

Unveiling AI Patterns: An Experimental Evaluation of Machine Learning based Women's Safety Prediction Strategy,"Tamilselvi, M.; Kumar, K.S.; Devi, G.; Shahad, P.; Sharmila, P.; Lakshmisridevi, S.","As is common knowledge, there is a long history of harassment of women all throughout the world, beginning with stalking and continuing to more serious types of abuse such as acid attacks, rape, obscenity, pornography, and other forms of abuse. In light of these worries, it has been proposed that the application of machine learning on tweets be utilized in order to do an analysis of the safety of women in urban areas of India. The Sentimental Analysis is employed as the primary idea, and it is carried out by machine learning using input from tweets. This is done to ensure that safety is taken into consideration. Increasing people's awareness can be accomplished by the use of sentiment analysis to tweets. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, which are well-known for their capacity to distribute information on a worldwide scale, provide women with the opportunity to communicate their feelings to the rest of the world. Because Twitter enables users to effortlessly connect with one another through text, audio, and video, we have listed it as a resource that is of great value. This enables our study to be more persuasive than the opinions of those who are in our immediate vicinity. In this study, a novel model that is referred to as the Artificial Intelligence based Safety Prediction Strategy (AISPS) is presented in order to provide a clear evaluation of the effectiveness of the system that has been recommended.

Features of Persuasive AI in the Workplace,"Averkiadi, E.; Van Osch, W.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can act as persuaders when implemented in workplace tools and infrastructure. How users process and react to interacting with features of such AI technologies in the workplace remains ill-understood.

DEVELOPING EMPATHY AS A STRATEGIC AND TACTICAL SKILL IN THE CONTEXT OF INNOVATING FOR TRANSGENDER CONSUMERS,"Braig, B.M.; Witt, H.","We begin with the premise that empathy adds value as a strategic marketing skill. Getting into the heads and hearts of consumers enables tailored offerings and tactics that meet the unique, richly contextualized needs of a given target audience segment. The advent of marketing automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to make human-centered skills even more critical to develop, as AI’s capabilities stop short of emotional connection and interpretation. As a result, we ask how empathy can be cultivated and applied, and if so, will empathy toward a given market segment result in attitude or behavior change? This paper details a three-stage project that gives students the opportunity to practice using empathy toward a specific market segment–transgender consumers. Students leverage empathy to ultimately develop concrete innovations across a broad range of marketing tactics. We also discuss the impact of the project on students. Results indicate that students completing the project embraced empathy as a strategic skill, and in the process, many also expressed intended support behaviors for the transgender community, although attitudes toward the transgender community did not change. © 2023 Society for Marketing Advances.",2024,,Marketing Education Review,34,1,60-76,,10.1080/10528008.2023.2226124,,#5100,Braig 2024,,,0

Engagement With a Relaxation and Mindfulness Mobile App Among People With Cancer: Exploratory Analysis of Use Data and Self-Reports From a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Schläpfer, S.; Schneider, F.; Santhanam, P.; Eicher, M.; Kowatsch, T.; Witt, C.M.; Barth, J.","Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer unique opportunities to support self-care and behavior change, but poor user engagement limits their effectiveness. This is particularly true for fully automated mHealth apps without any human support. Human support in mHealth apps is associated with better engagement but at the cost of reduced scalability. Objective: This work aimed to (1) describe the theory-informed development of a fully automated relaxation and mindfulness app to reduce distress in people with cancer (CanRelax app 2.0), (2) describe engagement with the app on multiple levels within a fully automated randomized controlled trial over 10 weeks, and (3) examine whether engagement was related to user characteristics. Methods: The CanRelax app 2.0 was developed in iterative processes involving input from people with cancer and relevant experts. The app includes evidence-based relaxation exercises, personalized weekly coaching sessions with a rule-based conversational agent, 39 self-enactable behavior change techniques, a self-monitoring dashboard with gamification elements, highly tailored reminder notifications, an educational video clip, and personalized in-app letters. For the larger study, German-speaking adults diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years were recruited via the web in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. Engagement was analyzed in a sample of 100 study participants with multiple measures on a micro level (completed coaching sessions, relaxation exercises practiced with the app, and feedback on the app) and a macro level (relaxation exercises practiced without the app and self-efficacy toward self-set weekly relaxation goals). Results: In week 10, a total of 62% (62/100) of the participants were actively using the CanRelax app 2.0. No associations were identified between engagement and level of distress at baseline, sex assigned at birth, educational attainment, or age. At the micro level, 71.88% (3520/4897) of all relaxation exercises and 714 coaching sessions were completed in the app, and all participants who provided feedback (52/100, 52%) expressed positive app experiences. At the macro level, 28.12% (1377/4897) of relaxation exercises were completed without the app, and participants' self-efficacy remained stable at a high level. At the same time, participants raised their weekly relaxation goals, which indicates a potential relative increase in self-efficacy. Conclusions: The CanRelax app 2.0 achieved promising engagement even though it provided no human support. Fully automated social components might have compensated for the lack of human involvement and should be investigated further. More than one-quarter (1377/4897, 28.12%) of all relaxation exercises were practiced without the app, highlighting the importance of assessing engagement on multiple levels. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Human Factors in AI-Driven Digital Solutions for Increasing Physical Activity: Scoping Review,"Gabarron, E.; Larbi, D.; Rivera-Romero, O.; Denecke, K.","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance physical activity (PA) interventions. However, human factors (HFs) play a pivotal role in the successful integration of AI into mobile health (mHealth) solutions for promoting PA. Understanding and optimizing the interaction between individuals and AI-driven mHealth apps is essential for achieving the desired outcomes. Objective: This study aims to review and describe the current evidence on the HFs in AI-driven digital solutions for increasing PA. Methods: We conducted a scoping review by searching for publications containing terms related to PA, HFs, and AI in the titles and abstracts across 3 databases—PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore—and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they were primary studies describing an AI-based solution aimed at increasing PA, and results from testing the solution were reported. Studies that did not meet these criteria were excluded. Additionally, we searched the references in the included articles for relevant research. The following data were extracted from included studies and incorporated into a qualitative synthesis: bibliographic information, study characteristics, population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and AI-related information. The certainty of the evidence in the included studies was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Results: A total of 15 studies published between 2015 and 2023 involving 899 participants aged approximately between 19 and 84 years, 60.7% (546/899) of whom were female participants, were included in this review. The interventions lasted between 2 and 26 weeks in the included studies. Recommender systems were the most commonly used AI technology in digital solutions for PA (10/15 studies), followed by conversational agents (4/15 studies). User acceptability and satisfaction were the HFs most frequently evaluated (5/15 studies each), followed by usability (4/15 studies). Regarding automated data collection for personalization and recommendation, most systems involved fitness trackers (5/15 studies). The certainty of the evidence analysis indicates moderate certainty of the effectiveness of AI-driven digital technologies in increasing PA (eg, number of steps, distance walked, or time spent on PA). Furthermore, AI-driven technology, particularly recommender systems, seems to positively influence changes in PA behavior, although with very low certainty evidence. Conclusions: Current research highlights the potential of AI-driven technologies to enhance PA, though the evidence remains limited. Longer-term studies are necessary to assess the sustained impact of AI-driven technologies on behavior change and habit formation. While AI-driven digital solutions for PA hold significant promise, further exploration into optimizing AI’s impact on PA and effectively integrating AI and HFs is crucial for broader benefits. Thus, the implications for innovation management involve conducting long-term studies, prioritizing diversity, ensuring research quality, focusing on user experience, and understanding the evolving role of AI in PA promotion. ©Elia Gabarron, Dillys Larbi, Octavio Rivera-Romero, Kerstin Denecke.

"Impact of a Health Coach–Led, Text-Based Digital Behavior Change Intervention on Weight Loss and Psychological Well-Being in Patients Receiving a Procedureless Intragastric Balloon Program: Prospective Single-Arm Study","Sacher, P.M.; Fulton, E.; Rogers, V.; Wilson, J.; Gramatica, M.; Dent, J.E.; Aarts, E.O.; Eccleston, D.; Greve, J.W.; Palm-Meinders, I.; Chuttani, R.","Background: Digital health interventions show promise for weight management. However, few text-based behavior change interventions have been designed to support patients receiving intragastric balloons, and none have simultaneously evaluated weight loss, psychological well-being, and behavior change despite the crucial interplay of these factors in weight management. Objective: This study aims to assess whether a health coach–led, asynchronous, text-based digital behavior change coaching intervention (DBCCI) delivered to participants receiving an intragastric balloon and its aftercare program was feasible and acceptable to participants and supported improved outcomes, including weight loss, psychological well-being, and lifestyle behavior change conducive to weight loss maintenance. Methods: This 12-month, single-arm prospective study enrolled adults aged 21 to 65 years with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 receiving a procedureless intragastric balloon (PIGB) at 5 bariatric clinics in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Participants received the DBCCI and the clinic-led PIGB aftercare program (remotely delivered) for 6 months after PIGB placement and then no intervention for an additional 6 months. The DBCCI was an evidence-based, personalized intervention wherein health coaches supported participants via exchanged asynchronous in-app text-based messages. Over the 12-month study, we assessed percentage of total body weight loss and psychological well-being via self-administered validated questionnaires (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life–Lite–Clinical Trials Version, Loss of Control Over Eating Scale–Brief, Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire–Short Form, and Barriers to Being Active Quiz). Participant engagement with and acceptability of the intervention were assessed via self-reported surveys. Results: Overall, 107 participants (n=96, 89.7% female; mean baseline BMI 35.4, SD 5.4 kg/m2) were included in the analysis. Mean total body weight loss was 13.5% (SEM 2.3%) at the end of the DBCCI and 11.22% (SEM 2.3%) at the 12-month follow-up (P<.001). Improvements were observed for all psychological well-being measures throughout the 12 months except for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (improvement at month 1) and Barriers to Being Active Quiz (improvements at months 3 and 6). Surveys showed high levels of engagement with and acceptability of the DBCCI. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the health coach–led, asynchronous, text-based DBCCI was engaging and acceptable to participants with overweight and obesity. The DBCCI, delivered alongside the PIGB and its aftercare program, supported improved weight loss outcomes and psychological well-being versus baseline and was associated with lifestyle behavior changes known to help achieve and maintain long-term weight loss and improved health outcomes. Follow-up findings suggest a potential need for longer-term, more intense coaching to focus on weight loss maintenance and support ongoing self-coaching. This could be achieved by leveraging generative artificial intelligence to provide ongoing automated behavior change coaching support to augment human-led care. ©Paul M Sacher, Emily Fulton, Victoria Rogers, Julia Wilson, Marco Gramatica, Jennifer E Dent, Edo O Aarts, David Eccleston, Jan Willem Greve, Inge Palm-Meinders, Ram Chuttani.",2024,,JMIR Formative Research,8,,,,10.2196/54723,,#5111,Sacher 2024,,,0
The Feasibility of AgileNudge+ Software to Facilitate Positive Behavioral Change: Mixed Methods Design,"Shojaei, F.; Desai, A.P.; Long, E.; Mehta, J.; Fowler, N.R.; Holden, R.J.; Orman, E.S.; Boustani, M.","Background: In today’s digital age, web-based apps have become integral to daily life, driving transformative shifts in human behavior. “AgileNudge+” (Indiana University Center for Health Innovation and Implementation Science) is a web-based solution to simplify the process of positive behavior change using nudging as an intervention. By integrating knowledge from behavioral economics with technology, AgileNudge+ organizes multiple steps, simplifies complex tasks, minimizes errors by enhancing user engagement, and provides resources for creating and testing nudge interventions. Objective: This paper aimed to outline the design process, methodologies, and usefulness of “AgileNudge+” for the development of evidence-based nudges. It used a mixed methods approach to evaluate the software’s interface usability and usefulness for creating and testing nudge interventions. Methods: AgileNudge+ was developed through iterative processes integrating principles from behavioral economics and user-centered design. The content of AgileNudge+ operationalizes an Agile science–based process to efficiently design, embed, and disseminate evidence-based nudges that encourage positive behavior change without limiting choice. Using a mixed methods approach, we tested AgileNudge+ software’s ability to organize and simplify the nudge intervention process, allowing a diverse range of scholars with limited knowledge of Agile science to use nudges. Usability testing assessed the tool’s usefulness and interface with a sample of 18 health care professionals, each asked to interact with the software and create a nudge intervention to solve a problem within their professional project’s sphere. Results: The study was funded in August 2022, with data collection occurring from June 2023 to July 2024. As of July 2024, we have enrolled 18 participants. Quantitative results found a mean usefulness rating of AgileNudge+ of 3.83 (95% CI 3.00-4.66). Qualitative results highlighted ways to modify the language used in AgileNudge+ to be more comprehensible to a diverse user base and promoted modifications to the software that facilitate real-time assistance and prioritize time efficiency in user interactions. Feedback further supported the positive impact of gamification on participant motivation when using the software. Conclusions: AgileNudge+ is an effective assistive tool for simplifying the positive behavior change process using nudge interventions, with tailored content and interactions to meet users’ needs and demands. Building onto the current design, future iterations of AgileNudge+ will use artificial intelligence to process large volumes of data while reducing the time and mental energy required to scan for existing cognitive biases and nudge prototypes. The software is also being upgraded to build on current gamification efforts, encouraging more sustained motivation by increasing the temporal resolution of the digital interface.

Market Demand Prediction using AI to reduce the aftermath of Bull Whip Effect,"Niresh Kumar, S.; Kirupakaran, C.; Harini, K.","Supply Chain Management is a quintessential task of every firm as it is the core of the business. A business is driven entirely by customer behaviour, change in seasonal demand and how the customer expand or shrunk their purchasing power. The stock available in the inventory should also be managed based on the changing demand, if under stocked or overstocked leads to huge losses to the business and they will also lose their market share. This work focuses on the ongoing problem in the supply chain domain, which is the Bull Whip Effect, wherein a slight change in the customer demand has a significant impact in the inventory leading to stocking more than required.

Leveraging Generative AI Tools to Support the Development of Digital Solutions in Health Care Research: Case Study,"Rodriguez, D.V.; Lawrence, K.; Gonzalez, J.; Brandfield-Harvey, B.; Xu, L.; Tasneem, S.; Levine, D.L.; Mann, D.","Background: Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize health technology product development by improving coding quality, efficiency, documentation, quality assessment and review, and troubleshooting. Objective: This paper explores the application of a commercially available generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) to the development of a digital health behavior change intervention designed to support patient engagement in a commercial digital diabetes prevention program. Methods: We examined the capacity, advantages, and limitations of ChatGPT to support digital product idea conceptualization, intervention content development, and the software engineering process, including software requirement generation, software design, and code production. In total, 11 evaluators, each with at least 10 years of experience in fields of study ranging from medicine and implementation science to computer science, participated in the output review process (ChatGPT vs human-generated output). All had familiarity or prior exposure to the original personalized automatic messaging system intervention. The evaluators rated the ChatGPT-produced outputs in terms of understandability, usability, novelty, relevance, completeness, and efficiency. Results: Most metrics received positive scores. We identified that ChatGPT can (1) support developers to achieve high-quality products faster and (2) facilitate nontechnical communication and system understanding between technical and nontechnical team members around the development goal of rapid and easy-to-build computational solutions for medical technologies. Conclusions: ChatGPT can serve as a usable facilitator for researchers engaging in the software development life cycle, from product conceptualization to feature identification and user story development to code generation. ©Danissa V Rodriguez, Katharine Lawrence, Javier Gonzalez, Beatrix Brandfield-Harvey, Lynn Xu, Sumaiya Tasneem, Defne L Levine, Devin Mann.

"Examining the persuasiveness of text and voice agents: prosody aligned with information structure increases human-likeness, perceived personalisation and brand attitude","Voorveld, H.; Panteli, A.; Schirris, Y.; Ischen, C.; Kanoulas, E.; Lentz, T.","To give product and brand recommendations, marketers make use of conversational agents which increasingly communicate via voice rather than text. Existing research comparing the persuasiveness of text and voice agents showed mixed results. The quality of the speech synthesis employed may strongly influence consumers’ responses. This study investigates to what extent a voice agent with pragmatically aligned prosody is more persuasive (i.e. yields a more positive brand attitude) than an agent with a standard voice or text, and whether perceived human-likeness and perceived personalisation provide an underlying mechanism to explain these differences. In an experiment (n = 212), participants interacted with a conversational agent that recommended a camera. Results showed that a voice agent using prosody aligned to the information state of the user is more persuasive than a text agent. This effect is mediated by perceived human-likeness and perceived personalisation. Hence, aligned prosody can make synthetic speech meet a certain quality threshold to be perceived as more human-like. Theoretically, this study helps to unravel why conversational agents with human-like features are more persuasive. © 2024 The Author(s).

This paper is an outcome of a unique experimental study which examines the built-in features of interactive storytelling games and their effect on induced persuasion and exploration among game players. This research involves eighty- eight players playing two popular games from the Netflix library. It tests the effects of artificial intelligence, feature interactivity, device responsiveness and personalization features of the game on induced persuasion and exploration among gamers. Using Bayesian regression and correlation, the results help to deduce that while built-in features can effectively persuade players, they fall short in encouraging deeper exploration within the game’s narrative.

Playing for the Highest Stakes,"Mazo, J.","Poker has often been used as a metaphor for international relations and existential threats such as nuclear weapons. Nate Silver’s On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything is a lengthy, often meandering but always entertaining exploration of this metaphor and its salience in the twenty-first century, from the world of professional gambling to existential risks such as climate change, nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence. The book has two entangled but independent threads: a discussion on how to think about risk, and a sociocultural conceit that modern elites, especially in the United States, can be meaningfully divided into two tribes competing for power and influence. What separates these groups are not, as Silver contends, cognitive and psychological traits, but in-group jargon and cultural references.

Achievement of sustainable environment through effectiveness of social media in Z generation of China,"Chen, B.; Madni, G.R.","Social media is emerged as a powerful communication tool over the past ten years. The Z generation’s green buying habits and purchase intentions are being reshaped by social media, which is helping to advance the development of a sustainable environment. The consumption of non-organic products has raised carbon emissions, so changing consumption patterns and purchase intentions is necessary for a more sustainable future. Moreover, earlier literature has the absence of a comprehensive behavior change model that explains the mechanism through which social media influences sustainable behaviors This study explores that how social media affects patterns of consumption for Z generation of China while considering the role of environmental concerns, subjective norms, eco-branding and eco-labeling on the basis of theory of planned behavior. A questionnaire is used to get information from the 563 Z generation respondents of China. The data is analyzed using Smart-PLS and empirical outcomes show that social media has a statistically significant influence on shaping and affecting green consumption behavior of China’s Z generation because it has the potential to reach a vast audience and spread awareness about environmental issues, leading to increased intention towards a sustainable environment and reduction in carbon emissions. It also provides a platform for individuals to express their opinions and engage in discussions on environmental issues. These developments are promising for the future of environmental sustainability as they indicate a growing interest in preserving the planet among the Z generation of China. It can be recommended as a policy tool that government and other organizations should support the development of informative content on social media platforms, highlighting the importance of environmental sustainability and ecofriendly habits.

BookGPT: A General Framework for Book Recommendation Empowered by Large Language Model,"Li, Z.; Chen, Y.; Zhang, X.; Liang, X.","With the continuous development and change exhibited by large language model (LLM) technology, represented by generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), many classic scenarios in various fields have re-emerged with new opportunities. This paper takes ChatGPT as the modeling object, incorporates LLM technology into the typical book resource understanding and recommendation scenario for the first time, and puts it into practice. By building a ChatGPT-like book recommendation system (BookGPT) framework based on ChatGPT, this paper attempts to apply ChatGPT to recommendation modeling for three typical tasks: book rating recommendation, user rating recommendation, and the book summary recommendation; it also explores the feasibility of LLM technology in book recommendation scenarios. At the same time, based on different evaluation schemes for book recommendation tasks and the existing classic recommendation models, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the BookGPT in book recommendation scenarios and analyzes the opportunities and improvement directions for subsequent LLMs in these scenarios. The experimental research shows the following: (1) The BookGPT can achieve good recommendation results in existing classic book recommendation tasks. Especially in cases containing less information about the target object to be recommended, such as zero-shot or one-shot learning tasks, the performance of the BookGPT is close to or even better than that of the current classic book recommendation algorithms, and this method has great potential for improvement. (2) In text generation tasks such as book summary recommendation, the recommendation effect of the BookGPT model is better than that of the manual editing process of Douban Reading, and it can even perform personalized interpretable content recommendations based on readers’ attribute and identity information, making it more persuasive than interpretable one-size-fits-all recommendation models. Finally, we have open-sourced the relevant datasets and experimental codes, hoping that the exploratory program proposed in this paper can inspire the development of more LLMs to expand their applications and theoretical research prospects in the field of book recommendation and general recommendation tasks. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Electronics (Switzerland),12,22,,,10.3390/electronics12224654,,#5132,Li 2023,,,0

Stab and yarn pull-out resistance of shear thickening fluids (STFs)/E-glass based on PEG modification and modeling yarn pull-out behavior with artificial intelligence,"Hai, T.; Mohammed Alhomayani, F.; Ajam, H.; Metwally, A.S.M.","Impregnating fabrics with shear thickening fluid (STF) improves impact resistance. In this study modification of polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) was carried out to enhance the thickening behavior of STF. The rheological analysis shows tunned STFs by PEG modification with glutaric acid and oxalic acid increase the maximum viscosity by about 10.33 and 3.28 folds with respect to unmodified STF. Additionally, the alternations of a liquid dispersion medium (PEG) led to higher chain length in STFs, representing superior interaction between media and particles by profuse H-bonding. The results confirmed that increasing the molecular length of PEG-based on STF caused a significant improvement in the knife and spike stabbing impact resistance, quasi-static, and yarn pull-out performance of the neat fabric. In addition, it was realized, by increasing impact velocity the energy absorption ability of STF-treated fabric composite increases. Additionally, a regression analysis using artificial intelligence was applied to study the effect of the pull-out rate on the mechanical response of different materials. Using a third-order polynomial for AI regression model, it turned out that while the pull-out rate has the least influence on untreated E-glass fabrics (UEG) response, for other materials, the behavior changes significantly by increasing the rate from 100 to 400 mm/min. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Journal of Composite Materials,57,23,3685-3702,,10.1177/00219983231191579,,#5138,Hai 2023,,,0
Deepfake Influence Tactics through the Lens of Cialdini’s Principles: Case Studies and the DEEP FRAME Tool Proposal,"Zegarow, P.; Bartuzi, E.","The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced both significant opportunities and challenges, with deepfake technology exemplifying the dual nature of AI’s impact.

TESCREAL hallucinations: Psychedelic and AI hype as inequality engines,"Devenot, N.","Background and Aims: While many scholars have called attention to similarities between the earlier SSRI hype and the ongoing hype for psychedelic medications, the rhetoric of psychedelic hype is tinged with utopian and esoteric aspirations that have no parallel in the discourse surrounding SSRIs or other antidepressants. This utopian discourse provides insight into the ways that global tech elites are instrumentalizing both psychedelics and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools in a broader world-building project that justifies increasing material inequality. If realized, this project would undermine the use of both tools for prosocial and pro-environmental outcomes. Methods: My argument develops through rhetorical analysis of the ways that industry leaders envision the future of medicalized psychedelics in their public communications. I draw on examples from media interviews, blog posts, podcasts, and press releases to underscore the persuasive strategies and ideological commitments that are driving the movement to transform psychedelics into pharmaceutical medications. Results: Counterfactual efforts to improve mental health by increasing inequality are widespread in the psychedelics industry. These efforts have been propelled by an elitist worldview that is widely-held in Silicon Valley. The backbone of this worldview is the TESCREAL bundle of ideologies, which describes an interrelated cluster of belief systems: transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism. Conclusions: This article demonstrates that TESCREALism is a driving force in major segments of the psychedelic pharmaceutical industry, where it is influencing the design of extractive systems that directly contradict the field's world-healing aspirations. These findings contribute to a developing subfield of critical psychedelic studies, which interrogates the political and economic implications of psychedelic medicalization.  © 2023 The Author(s).",2023,,Journal of Psychedelic Studies,7,,22-39,,10.1556/2054.2023.00292,,#5140,Devenot 2023,,,0

In marketing, persuasion can help customers find solutions to their problems, make informed choices, or convince someone to buy a useful (or useless) product or service. In computer crimes, persuasion can trick users into revealing sensitive information, or even performing actions that benefit attackers. Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of persuasion-based attacks, as it exploits human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones. Therefore, an intelligent system capable of detecting and classifying persuasion attempts might be useful in protecting users. In this work, an approach that uses Machine Learning to analyze messages based on principles of persuasion and different data representations is presented. The aim of this research is to detect which data representation and which classification algorithm obtain the best results in detecting each principle of persuasion as a prior step to detecting phishing attacks. The results obtained indicate that among the combinations tested, there is one combination of data representation and classification algorithm that performs best.

Mapping the Design Space of Technology-Based Solutions for Better Chronic Pain Care: Introducing the Pain Tech Landscape,"Janevic, M.R.; Murnane, E.; Fillingim, R.B.; Kerns, R.D.; Reid, M.C.","Objectives Technology has substantial potential to transform and extend care for persons with chronic pain, a burdensome and costly condition. To catalyze the development of impactful applications of technology in this space, we developed the Pain Tech Landscape (PTL) model, which integrates pain care needs with characteristics of technological solutions. Methods Our interdisciplinary group representing experts in pain and human factors research developed PTL through iterative discussions. To demonstrate one potential use of the model, we apply data generated from a narrative review of selected pain and technology journals (2000-2020) in the form of heat map overlays, to reveal where pain tech research attention has focused to date. Results The PTL comprises three two-dimensional planes, with pain care needs on each x axis (measurement to management) and technology applications on the y axes according to a) user agency (user- to system-driven), b) usage time frame (temporary to lifelong), and c) collaboration (single-user to collaborative). Heat maps show that existing applications reside primarily in the ""user-driven/management""quadrant (e.g., self-care apps). Examples of less developed areas include artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (i.e., Internet-linked household objects), and collaborative/social tools for pain management. Conclusions Collaborative development between the pain and tech fields in early developmental stages using the PTL as a common language could yield impactful solutions for chronic pain management. The PTL could also be used to track developments in the field over time.

Building on their framework, we offer some additional areas for future work, including how to use language to better understand patients, how communication mediums (e.g., writing vs. speaking or online portals vs. email) shape what gets communicated, and how effective communication depends on the interaction’s goals (e.g., persuasion vs. medical adherence). © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Journal of Service Research,26,4,514-516,,10.1177/10946705231194075,,#5146,Berger 2023,,,0
Digital Culture and the U.S.-Mexico Border: Rhetorics on Human Mobility,"de Luna, R.R.; Ricalde, M.C.","Conceptualizing how digital artifacts can function as a frontier mediated by technology in the geographical, physical, sensory, visual, discursive, and imaginary, this volume offers an interdisciplinary analysis of digital material circulating online in a way that creates a digital dimension of the Mexico-U.S. border. In the context of a world where digital media has helped to shape geopolitical borders and impacted human mobility in positive and negative ways, the book explores new modes of expression in which identification, memory, representation, persuasion, and meaning-making are created, experienced, and/or circulated through digital technologies. An interdisciplinary team of scholars looks at how quick communications bring closer transnational families and how online resources can be helpful for migrants, but also at how digital media can serve to control and reinforce borders via digital technology used to create a system of political control that reinforces stereotypes. The book deconstructs digital artifacts such as the digital press, social media, digital archives, web platforms, technological and artistic creations, visual arts, video games, and artificial intelligence to help us understand the anti-immigrant and dehumanizing discourse of control, as well as the ways migrants create vernacular narratives as digital activism to break the stereotypes that afflict them. This timely and insightful volume will interest scholars and students of digital media, communication studies, journalism, migration, and politics. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Rubria Rocha de Luna and Maricruz Castro Ricalde; individual chapters, the contributors.",2024,,Digital Culture and the U.S.-Mexico Border: Rhetorics on Human Mobility,,,1-240,,10.4324/9781003519263,,#5147,deLuna 2024,,,0

The Embodiment of Knowing: Countering the Effects of AI Overuse through Education,"Sanchez, S.","This conceptual paper starts with an account of modern societies who turned to objects in order to escape their overwhelming surroundings. It tracks how these objects evolved into mobile digital devices that, in an attention economy, paradoxically became objects that overwhelm attention and hamper cognitive abilities, ultimately affecting students’ learning. Through a philosophical analysis of persuasion, these persuasive technologies are presented as the main cause of declining motivation in learning. A theory synthesis on the brain’s predisposition to simplify cognitive processes, in order not to be overwhelmed, warrants the ease in which persuasive technologies have led to digital dementia. It then presents the 4P taxonomy of the four types of knowing and the four general types of memory as method theories to support embodied cognition in education through the postulate that the body precedes the mind when it comes to learning. The analysis leads to the hypothesis that artificial intelligence (AI) affects students, not by providing certainty, but by eliminating uncertainty and concludes that learning is in the inherent embodied skills used to reduce uncertainty. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

"The Complex Interaction Between Sleep-Related Information, Misinformation, and Sleep Health: Call for Comprehensive Research on Sleep Infodemiology and Infoveillance","Bragazzi, N.L.; Garbarino, S.","The complex interplay between sleep-related information—both accurate and misleading—and its impact on clinical public health is an emerging area of concern. Lack of awareness of the importance of sleep, and inadequate information related to sleep, combined with misinformation about sleep, disseminated through social media, nonexpert advice, commercial interests, and other sources, can distort individuals’ understanding of healthy sleep practices. Such misinformation can lead to the adoption of unhealthy sleep behaviors, reducing sleep quality and exacerbating sleep disorders. Simultaneously, poor sleep itself impairs critical cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These impairments can heighten individuals’ vulnerability to misinformation, creating a vicious cycle that further entrenches poor sleep habits and unhealthy behaviors. Sleep deprivation is known to reduce the ability to critically evaluate information, increase suggestibility, and enhance emotional reactivity, making individuals more prone to accepting persuasive but inaccurate information. This cycle of misinformation and poor sleep creates a clinical public health issue that goes beyond individual well-being, influencing occupational performance, societal productivity, and even broader clinical public health decision-making. The effects are felt across various sectors, from health care systems burdened by sleep-related issues to workplaces impacted by decreased productivity due to sleep deficiencies. The need for comprehensive clinical public health initiatives to combat this cycle is critical. These efforts must promote sleep literacy, increase awareness of sleep’s role in cognitive resilience, and correct widespread sleep myths. Digital tools and technologies, such as sleep-tracking devices and artificial intelligence–powered apps, can play a role in educating the public and enhancing the accessibility of accurate, evidence-based sleep information. However, these tools must be carefully designed to avoid the spread of misinformation through algorithmic biases. Furthermore, research into the cognitive impacts of sleep deprivation should be leveraged to develop strategies that enhance societal resilience against misinformation. Sleep infodemiology and infoveillance, which involve tracking and analyzing the distribution of sleep-related information across digital platforms, offer valuable methodologies for identifying and addressing the spread of misinformation in real time. Addressing this issue requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between sleep scientists, health care providers, educators, policy makers, and digital platform regulators. By promoting healthy sleep practices and debunking myths, it is possible to disrupt the feedback loop between poor sleep and misinformation, leading to improved individual health, better decision-making, and stronger societal outcomes. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

Automated detection of absence seizures using a wearable electroencephalographic device: a phase 3 validation study and feasibility of automated behavioral testing,"Japaridze, G.; Loeckx, D.; Buckinx, T.; Armand Larsen, S.; Proost, R.; Jansen, K.; MacMullin, P.; Paiva, N.; Kasradze, S.; Rotenberg, A.; Lagae, L.; Beniczky, S.","Objective: Our primary goal was to measure the accuracy of fully automated absence seizure detection, using a wearable electroencephalographic (EEG) device. As a secondary goal, we also tested the feasibility of automated behavioral testing triggered by the automated detection. Methods: We conducted a phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04615442), with a prospective, multicenter, blinded study design. The input was the one-channel EEG recorded with dry electrodes embedded into a wearable headband device connected to a smartphone. The seizure detection algorithm was developed using artificial intelligence (convolutional neural networks). During the study, the predefined algorithm, with predefined cutoff value, analyzed the EEG in real time. The gold standard was derived from expert evaluation of simultaneously recorded full-array video-EEGs. In addition, we evaluated the patients' responsiveness to the automated alarms on the smartphone, and we compared it with the behavioral changes observed in the clinical video-EEGs. Results: We recorded 102 consecutive patients (57 female, median age = 10 years) on suspicion of absence seizures. We recorded 364 absence seizures in 39 patients. Device deficiency was 4.67%, with a total recording time of 309 h. Average sensitivity per patient was 78.83% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 69.56%–88.11%), and median sensitivity was 92.90% (interquartile range [IQR] = 66.7%–100%). The average false detection rate was.53/h (95% CI =.32–.74). Most patients (n = 66, 64.71%) did not have any false alarms. The median F1 score per patient was.823 (IQR =.57–1). For the total recording duration, F1 score was.74. We assessed the feasibility of automated behavioral testing in 36 seizures; it correctly documented nonresponsiveness in 30 absence seizures, and responsiveness in six electrographic seizures. Significance: Automated detection of absence seizures with a wearable device will improve seizure quantification and will promote assessment of patients in their home environment. Linking automated seizure detection to automated behavioral testing will provide valuable information from wearable devices. © 2022 The Authors.

Living With Digital Government: Effects of Technology Anxiety on Public Support for Policy in China,"Xiao, H.; He, Y.; Ge, W.","Living with digital government is less of a technical issue but more of a political process. In political science, one new issue in need of greater theorizing and investigating is public anxiety about the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) by digital government which has become an emerging challenge for the country to obtain public support. Employing an online survey in China, we test whether technology anxiety influences public support for policy and examine the mechanisms within them, namely, political persuasion, interaction orientation, and people’s happiness. Survey evidence reveals that technology anxiety exerts a significantly negative effect on public support, especially in flexible employment and service industry. Additionally, technology anxiety indirectly influences public support for policy through the three abovementioned mechanisms, with political persuasion based on algorithm demonstrating the most pronounced mediating role. The findings contribute to understanding the relationship between public anxiety and political support in Chinese context and beyond, and enrich the studies of political psychology and legitimacy. © Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies 2024.",2024,,Journal of Chinese Political Science,,,,,10.1007/s11366-024-09898-y,,#5152,Xiao 2024,,,0
PsyConversion®: 117 Behavior Patterns for an improved User Experience and higher Conversion Rates in E-Commerce,"Spreer, P.","This book offers 117 concrete applicable behavior patterns for an improved user experience and conversion rate along the customer journey. The author explains how people decide, which unconscious behavior patterns they use, and how these can be addressed in digital marketing. Science now agrees that our brain works with two systems: an emotional-intuitive and a rational decision-making system. The rational system is provided with sufficient arguments in e-commerce, but accounts for only around 5% of all decisions! The remaining 95% of the customer's brain has so far been largely neglected. There, decisions are made based on deeply anchored, unconscious patterns of behavior – the so-called ""behavior patterns"". Knowledge of behavior patterns makes it possible to finally understand online customer behavior in depth. This reveals the opportunity to specifically improve the user experience and make your business more successful.

Machine Learning Methods to Personalize Persuasive Strategies in mHealth Interventions That Promote Physical Activity: Scoping Review and Categorization Overview,"Brons, A.; Wang, S.; Visser, B.; Kröse, B.; Bakkes, S.; Veltkamp, R.","Background: Although physical activity (PA) has positive effects on health and well-being, physical inactivity is a worldwide problem. Mobile health interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting PA. Personalizing persuasive strategies improves intervention success and can be conducted using machine learning (ML). For PA, several studies have addressed personalized persuasive strategies without ML, whereas others have included personalization using ML without focusing on persuasive strategies. An overview of studies discussing ML to personalize persuasive strategies in PA-promoting interventions and corresponding categorizations could be helpful for such interventions to be designed in the future but is still missing. Objective: First, we aimed to provide an overview of implemented ML techniques to personalize persuasive strategies in mobile health interventions promoting PA. Moreover, we aimed to present a categorization overview as a starting point for applying ML techniques in this field. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for studies that included ML to personalize persuasive strategies in interventions promoting PA. Papers were screened using the ASReview software. From the included papers, categorized by the research project they belonged to, we extracted data regarding general study information, target group, PA intervention, implemented technology, and study details. On the basis of the analysis of these data, a categorization overview was given. Results: In total, 40 papers belonging to 27 different projects were included. These papers could be categorized in 4 groups based on their dimension of personalization. Then, for each dimension, 1 or 2 persuasive strategy categories were found together with a type of ML. The overview resulted in a categorization consisting of 3 levels: dimension of personalization, persuasive strategy, and type of ML. When personalizing the timing of the messages, most projects implemented reinforcement learning to personalize the timing of reminders and supervised learning (SL) to personalize the timing of feedback, monitoring, and goal-setting messages. Regarding the content of the messages, most projects implemented SL to personalize PA suggestions and feedback or educational messages. For personalizing PA suggestions, SL can be implemented either alone or combined with a recommender system. Finally, reinforcement learning was mostly used to personalize the type of feedback messages. Conclusions: The overview of all implemented persuasive strategies and their corresponding ML methods is insightful for this interdisciplinary field. Moreover, it led to a categorization overview that provides insights into the design and development of personalized persuasive strategies to promote PA. In future papers, the categorization overview might be expanded with additional layers to specify ML methods or additional dimensions of personalization and persuasive strategies. © Annette Brons, Shihan Wang, Bart Visser, Ben Kröse, Sander Bakkes, Remco Veltkamp.",2024,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,26,,,,10.2196/47774,,#5154,Brons 2024,,,0

Digital Mental Health for Schizophrenia and Other Severe Mental Illnesses: An International Consensus on Current Challenges and Potential Solutions,"Smith, K.A.; Hardy, A.; Vinnikova, A.; Blease, C.; Milligan, L.; Hidalgo-Mazzei, D.; Lambe, S.; Marzano, L.; Uhlhaas, P.J.; Ostinelli, E.G.; Anmella, G.; Zangani, C.; Aronica, R.; Dwyer, B.; Torous, J.; Cipriani, A.","Background: Digital approaches may be helpful in augmenting care to address unmet mental health needs, particularly for schizophrenia and severe mental illness (SMI). Objective: An international multidisciplinary group was convened to reach a consensus on the challenges and potential solutions regarding collecting data, delivering treatment, and the ethical challenges in digital mental health approaches for schizophrenia and SMI. Methods: The consensus development panel method was used, with an in-person meeting of 2 groups: the expert group and the panel. Membership was multidisciplinary including those with lived experience, with equal participation at all stages and coproduction of the consensus outputs and summary. Relevant literature was shared in advance of the meeting, and a systematic search of the recent literature on digital mental health interventions for schizophrenia and psychosis was completed to ensure that the panel was informed before the meeting with the expert group. Results: Four broad areas of challenge and proposed solutions were identified: (1) user involvement for real coproduction; (2) new approaches to methodology in digital mental health, including agreed standards, data sharing, measuring harms, prevention strategies, and mechanistic research; (3) regulation and funding issues; and (4) implementation in real-world settings (including multidisciplinary collaboration, training, augmenting existing service provision, and social and population-focused approaches). Examples are provided with more detail on human-centered research design, lived experience perspectives, and biomedical ethics in digital mental health approaches for SMI. Conclusions: The group agreed by consensus on a number of recommendations: (1) a new and improved approach to digital mental health research (with agreed reporting standards, data sharing, and shared protocols), (2) equal emphasis on social and population research as well as biological and psychological approaches, (3) meaningful collaborations across varied disciplines that have previously not worked closely together, (4) increased focus on the business model and product with planning and new funding structures across the whole development pathway, (5) increased focus and reporting on ethical issues and potential harms, and (6) organizational changes to allow for true communication and coproduction with those with lived experience of SMI. This study approach, combining an international expert meeting with patient and public involvement and engagement throughout the process, consensus methodology, discussion, and publication, is a helpful way to identify directions for future research and clinical implementation in rapidly evolving areas and can be combined with measurements of real-world clinical impact over time. Similar initiatives will be helpful in other areas of digital mental health and similarly fast-evolving fields to focus research and organizational change and effect improved real-world clinical implementation. ©Katharine A Smith, Amy Hardy, Anastasia Vinnikova, Charlotte Blease, Lea Milligan, Diego Hidalgo-Mazzei, Sinéad Lambe, Lisa Marzano, Peter J Uhlhaas, Edoardo G Ostinelli, Gerard Anmella, Caroline Zangani, Rosario Aronica, Bridget Dwyer, John Torous, Andrea Cipriani.",2024,,JMIR Mental Health,11,,,,10.2196/57155,,#5156,Smith 2024,,,0
EU DisinfoTest: a Benchmark for Evaluating Language Models' Ability to Detect Disinformation Narratives,"Sosnowski, W.; Modzelewski, A.; Skorupska, K.; Otterbacher, J.; Wierzbicki, A.","As narratives shape public opinion and influence societal actions, distinguishing between truthful and misleading narratives has become a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the EU DisinfoTest, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the efficacy of Language Models in identifying disinformation narratives. Developed through a Human-in-the-Loop methodology and grounded in research from EU DisinfoLab, the EU DisinfoTest comprises more than 1,300 narratives. Our benchmark includes persuasive elements under Logos, Pathos, and Ethos rhetorical dimensions. We assessed state-of-the-art LLMs, including the newly released GPT-4o, on their capability to perform zero-shot classification of disinformation narratives versus credible narratives. Our findings reveal that LLMs tend to regard narratives with authoritative appeals as trustworthy, while those with emotional appeals are frequently incorrectly classified as disinformative. These findings highlight the challenges LLMs face in nuanced content interpretation and suggest the need for tailored adjustments in LLM training to better handle diverse narrative structures. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2024,,"EMNLP 2024 - 2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Findings of EMNLP 2024",,,14702-14723,,10.18653/v1/2024.findings-emnlp.862,,#5157,Sosnowski 2024,,,0
Exploring Implicit and Explicit Stimuli of Virtual Agents with Increased Group Size in VR,"Jung, S.; Wile, N.; Jung, K.H.J.","It remains unknown whether the virtual agents' implicit behaviors (e.g., the agent's eye-gaze shifting) would also cause such an observable effect on the users' experiences even when the users are not consciously aware of the implicit behaviors of the agents. More importantly, it is unclear whether the effect of the implicit behaviors of agents can be amplified as the agents' group size increases. To answer these questions, we asked two participant groups ($\mathrm{N}=12$ each) to deliver a public speech in front of the virtual agents showing either an explicit (head movement) or implicit (eye movement) behavior as we manipulated the agents' group sizes (small, medium, and large). We measured the users' perceptions, emotions, and behavior (head and eye movements) in the study. A posterior psychophysical experiment confirmed the implicit nature of the eye-movement behavior of the virtual agents (i.e., participants' detection rate of the eye movements was less than the chance level). The results showed that the explicit behavior of the virtual agents caused the expected participant behavior changes along with negative emotions. In contrast, the implicit behavior of the agents caused largely positive emotions, yet, without significant behavior changes of the participants. Most importantly, as the group size of the virtual agents increased, the degree of their effect on users increased in both the explicit head-movement condition and the implicit eye-movement condition. © 2024 IEEE.",2024,,"Proceedings - 2024 IEEE International Symposium on Mixed and Augmented Reality, ISMAR 2024",,,1058-1067,,10.1109/ISMAR62088.2024.00122,,#5158,Jung 2024,,,0
Motivating COVID-19 Vaccination through Persuasive Communication: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials,"Xia, S.; Nan, X.","Vaccination is a vital defense against COVID-19 infections and outbreaks, yet vaccine hesitancy poses a significant threat to pandemic response and recovery. We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (N = 47) assessing the persuasive effects of COVID-19 communication on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Individual vs. collective appeals and gain vs. loss frames are among the most frequently assessed message features, but they generally do not make a difference in persuasion. Normative messages that highlight higher (vs. lower) prevalence of vaccine acceptance are more persuasive. Message sources overall have limited impact on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, but sources that have a shared identity with the message receivers tend to be persuasive. More engaging message channels such as interactive chatbots and videos are promising communication tools but are generally under-utilized and under-studied. Compared to no communication or irrelevant communication, COVID-19 vaccine messages generally have a small advantage in increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Messages that include 1) vaccine safety and/or efficacy information; 2) collective appeals combined with embarrassment appeals; and 3) political leaders’ vaccine endorsement are among the most effective messaging strategies. There is no evidence of any backfire effects of COVID-19 vaccine messages. We discuss the implications of our findings for persuasive message design in pandemic vaccine communication. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",2024,,Health Communication,39,8,1455-1478,,10.1080/10410236.2023.2218145,,#5159,Xia 2024,,,0
AI-Empowered Persuasive Video Generation: A Survey,"Liu, C.; Yu, H.","Promotional videos are rapidly becoming a popular medium for persuading people to change their behaviours in many settings (e.g., online shopping, social enterprise initiatives). Today, such videos are often produced by professionals, which is a time-, labour- and cost-intensive undertaking. In order to produce such contents to support large applications (e.g., e-commerce), the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered persuasive video generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is interdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to grasp. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey of AIPVG available. In this paper, we bridge this gap by reviewing key AI techniques that can be utilized to automatically generate persuasive videos. We offer a first-of-its-kind taxonomy which divides AIPVG into three major steps: (1) visual material understanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs) relevant to the target of promotion; (2) visual storyline generation, which shortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a storyline with persuasive power; and (3) post-production, which involves background music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing experience. We also introduce the evaluation metrics and datasets commonly adopted in the field of AIPVG. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the existing works belonging to the above-mentioned steps, and discuss interesting potential future research directions. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of chatbots on lifestyle behaviours,"Singh, B.; Olds, T.; Brinsley, J.; Dumuid, D.; Virgara, R.; Matricciani, L.; Watson, A.; Szeto, K.; Eglitis, E.; Miatke, A.; Simpson, C.E.M.; Vandelanotte, C.; Maher, C.","Chatbots (also known as conversational agents and virtual assistants) offer the potential to deliver healthcare in an efficient, appealing and personalised manner. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of chatbot interventions designed to improve physical activity, diet and sleep. Electronic databases were searched for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and pre-post trials that evaluated chatbot interventions targeting physical activity, diet and/or sleep, published before 1 September 2022. Outcomes were total physical activity, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality and sleep duration. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare intervention effects. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess chatbot type, intervention type, duration, output and use of artificial intelligence. Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Nineteen trials were included. Sample sizes ranged between 25–958, and mean participant age ranged between 9–71 years. Most interventions (n = 15, 79%) targeted physical activity, and most trials had a low-quality rating (n = 14, 74%). Meta-analysis results showed significant effects (all p < 0.05) of chatbots for increasing total physical activity (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.16, 0.40]), daily steps (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.17, 0.39]), MVPA (SMD = 0.53 [95% CI = 0.24, 0.83]), fruit and vegetable consumption (SMD = 0.59 [95% CI = 0.25, 0.93]), sleep duration (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI = 0.32, 0.55]) and sleep quality (SMD = 0.50 [95% CI = 0.09, 0.90]). Subgroup analyses showed that text-based, and artificial intelligence chatbots were more efficacious than speech/voice chatbots for fruit and vegetable consumption, and multicomponent interventions were more efficacious than chatbot-only interventions for sleep duration and sleep quality (all p < 0.05). Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that chatbot interventions are efficacious for increasing physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep duration and sleep quality. Chatbot interventions were efficacious across a range of populations and age groups, with both short- and longer-term interventions, and chatbot only and multicomponent interventions being efficacious. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,npj Digital Medicine,6,1,,,10.1038/s41746-023-00856-1,,#5161,Singh 2023,,,0
Addictive brain-network identification by spatial attention recurrent network with feature selection,"Gong, C.; Chen, X.; Mughal, B.; Wang, S.","Addiction in the brain is associated with adaptive changes that reshape addiction-related brain regions and lead to functional abnormalities that cause a range of behavioral changes, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies can reveal complex dynamic patterns of brain functional change. However, it is still a challenge to identify functional brain networks and discover region-level biomarkers between nicotine addiction (NA) and healthy control (HC) groups. To tackle it, we transform the fMRI of the rat brain into a network with biological attributes and propose a novel feature-selected framework to extract and select the features of addictive brain regions and identify these graph-level networks. In this framework, spatial attention recurrent network (SARN) is designed to capture the features with spatial and time-sequential information. And the Bayesian feature selection(BFS) strategy is adopted to optimize the model and improve classification tasks by restricting features.

A scoping review of neurodegenerative manifestations in explainable digital phenotyping,"Alfalahi, H.; Dias, S.B.; Khandoker, A.H.; Chaudhuri, K.R.; Hadjileontiadis, L.J.","Neurologists nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as “bio-psycho-social” conditions. Not only does this translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, eventually, treatment personalization. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,npj Parkinson's Disease,9,1,,,10.1038/s41531-023-00494-0,,#5163,Alfalahi 2023,,,0
The potential impacts of the digital revolution on the operational risk profiles of banks,"Grimwade, M.","Society is undergoing a digital revolution. This is altering the business profiles of banks in terms of their systems, processes, controls and usage of third parties; their competitive landscape, ie competition from both digitising incumbents and new BigTech and FinTech entrants; and the behaviours of stakeholders, ranging from customers to cyber-criminals. This digital revolution is amplifying some of their existing risks, while also creating new risks, eg the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) tools to change behaviours over time (AI model drift). Some of these changes in operational risk profile will be transient, as they are associated with digital transformation, while others will be both ongoing and characterised by a high degree of dynamism. In this digitised endstate higher frequency/lower value human errors, may be replaced by lower frequency/higher impact systemic losses, arising from both catastrophic and silent failures. The influence of the digital revolution spans almost all of the Basel operational risk event categories, and may also lead to the enhancement of some controls (eg surveillance), while others may be undermined (eg by voice-spoofing). There is no silver bullet to mitigate these risks; instead, a portfolio of existing control frameworks need to be enhanced, including the following: change management; model risk management; third party vendor management; business continuity management, disaster recovery and operational resilience; and cybersecurity, with new controls required to address the new risks associated with AI.

Circular and Sustainable Multi Business Model Innovation and Development:,"Lindgren, P.","The circular economy is used as a concept to advance and push the green and sustainability transition process in businesses to a more circular, green, resource effective economy. However, it has turned out to be much more complex to innovate, develop, implement, operate and not least measure Circular and Sustainable business models for businesses - especially for SME's and Startups - although the approach - by many - is emphasized as “easy” strategies and implementation. Achieving Circularity and Sustainability (environmentally, economically and socially parameters) - at the same time - related to business models has not yet been clearly defined, shown, proven and measured. Achieving environmental, economic and social goals - equal to sustainability - at the same time - the”triple bottom line” approach - in a circular perspective is a great dilemma to many businesses because the parameters often conflict each other. Advanced sensor technologies, 5G and 6g technologies gives great hope to be able to make it more visual and transparent to what businesses are really doing and strategically want to do. Advanced technology could help to visualize the process and the dilemma - in close to real time. Advanced sensor, 5G, 6G technologies imbedded in Business Model's (BM) and Circular Sustainable Multi Business Model Innovation and Development processes gives hopes for a new leadership and management era together with better measurement tools, practice, and approaches. It also gives hope to a higher speed on circular and sustainable transition - visualizing and thereby hopefully preventing greenwashing. The EU project Greenbizz II A and B's vision is to speed up the Circular and Sustainable Multi Business Model Innovation and Development (CSMBMID) process in SME's and Startups together with their business value network. The aim is to achieve and implement Scope 3 - but under the goal to also create at the same time effectiveness, efficiency and sociality in CSMBMID. By reengineering AS IS BM's - and designing Circular and Sustainable Business Models (CSBM) - the vision of Greenbizz II A and B are however very complex by nature. It requires a manifold of activities, different network constellations and not least further research, innovation and development of sensors, 5G and 6G technologies, learning and traning and a CSMBMID Brain. Greenbizz II A and B build on top of EU Greenbizz 1 project, as Green, Economic and Social parameters are seeked measured and achieved together with circularity at the same time in a new “Circular Sustainable Triple Bottom Line” measurement framework. A new advanced monitoring smartboard using advanced sensors and wireless technologies prototyped in SMEs/Startups - and their business value networks - will be prototyped and tried to be implemented from 2024-2026 in 96 SME and Startup businesses. The paper discuss through 3 case examples in different Business Model ecosystems contexts, challenges to do CSMBMID and how advance sensor, 5G and 6G technologies is expected to help and support circular sustainable BM transition in businesses. It points to how CSBM's can be innovated, developed and implemented supported by advance sensor, artificial intelligence, deep learning, persuasive technologies, Multi Business Model Innovation pattern analysis and libraries of BM archetypes. © 2024 River Publishers.",2024,,Journal of Mobile Multimedia,20,1,111-156,,10.13052/jmm1550-4646.2015,,#5166,Lindgren 2024,,,0
Developing a GPT-Based text Extraction Model for Cancer Information,"Yi, Y.J.; Jo, J.; Bae, B.J.; Moon, H.; Yoon, J.; Lee, S.","By employing Aristotle's rhetoric as the theoretical framework, the present study aims to develop a model that automatically extracts the three key components of persuasive strategies-ethos (authority), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logic)-from answers to pertinent cancer questions on Quora, a social question and answer platform. Furthermore, we apply the model to discrete groups of the most upvoted and random (non-upvoted) answers to compare differences in the three persuasive components. The dataset consists of a total of 103 questions and their corresponding answers, including both upvoted and random answers. It was employed for preliminary findings, comprising a total of 33 questions and answers, with answers to 19 questions used as training data and answers to 14 questions used as test data. We annotated sentences in the answers according to the three types of rhetoric employed. We then fine-tuned models based on Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) to classify the phrases, achieving an average F1 score of 0.84. Paired sample t-tests confirmed our research hypotheses regarding ethos and logos, while our hypothesis about pathos was not confirmed. Results suggest that ethos and logos are effective in communicating cancer information to consumers, but that pathos is not.  © 2024 IEEE.",2024,,"Proceedings of the 14th International Conference on Cloud Computing, Data Science and Engineering, Confluence 2024",,,165-169,,10.1109/Confluence60223.2024.10463424,,#5168,Yi 2024,,,0
Toward the Prevention of Privacy Threats: How Can We Persuade Our Social Network Platform Users?,"Ruiz-Dolz, R.; Alemany, J.; Heras, S.; García-Fornes, A.","Complex decision-making problems, such as the privacy policy selection, when sharing content in online social network (OSN) platforms can significantly benefit from artificial intelligence systems. With the use of computational argumentation, it is possible to persuade human users to modify their initial decisions to avoid potential privacy threats and violations. In this paper, we present a study performed with the participation of 186 teenage users aimed at analyzing their behaviors when we try to persuade them to modify the post/publication of sensitive content on OSN platforms with different arguments. The results of the study revealed that the personality traits and the social interaction data (e.g., number of comment posts, friends, and likes) of our participants were significantly correlated with the persuasive power of the arguments. Therefore, these sets of features can be used to model OSN users and estimate the persuasive power of different arguments when used in human-computer interactions. The findings presented in this paper are helpful for personalizing decision support systems aimed at educating and preventing privacy violations on OSN platforms using arguments. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.",2024,,Human-centric Computing and Information Sciences,14,,,,10.22967/HCIS.2024.14.046,,#5169,Ruiz-Dolz 2024,,,0
Analysis Implementation of Chatbots to Increase Knowledge of Stunting Prevention in Indonesian Society with Bibliometric,"Sutedja, I.; Handayani, L.; Faisal, M.R.","The healthcare industry uses AI, because it is more efficient. In Indonesia, the accuracy of measurements and transmission of children's growth and development is often wrong. Many small hospitals usually don't have length measuring equipment, so the results are inaccurate. This research aims to determine the effectiveness of the stunting prevention program in Indonesia using an information system. The methodology used is a qualitative method, to conduct subjective research and analysis. The results of the research are to improve the website/mobile application information system which can display a child's growth and development history and simple educational information related to nutrition. Digital recording methods can speed up the process of updating data with a central database in real time. The value of this research is to reach the public to utilize technology and obtain personalized and interactive information directly to individuals. The theoretical implications of this research focus on information dissemination and understanding how chatbots influence knowledge acquisition and behavior change in the context of stunting prevention can contribute to advancing these theories in the field of public health.

A Machine Learning Algorithm to Tackle Chat Messages,"Ambika, N.","Due to recent shifts in the digital workplace, chat-based social engineering (CSE) attacks (Salahdine & Kaabouch, 2019) are receiving more attention. Persuasion is regarded as the catalyst for successful CSE attacks, and sophisticated CSE attacks target human personality traits. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multilayer perceptron comprise the task-specific neural network architecture proposed as the CSE-PUC (Tsinganos, Mavridis, & Gritzalis, 2022). By generating a probability distribution over the sentence classes, the classifier is tasked with determining whether a sentence is an influential payload (pp)-container and whether it carries a persuasive payload. The CNN was used as a feature extractor and later integrated with the rest of the architecture. The prediction task’s final result is the consequence of the thorough training of the entire CSE-PUC network. These patterns are made up of specific token set order sequences. The CNN uses sentences to feed a deep learning network architecture known as the CSE-PUC to identify such informative cues. The CSE corpus, which was created by collecting real-world and fictional social engineering attack dialogues from dark social engineering websites, social engineering books, and several logs, was used to train the CSE-PUC architecture. It created the CSE corpus with a few characteristics following a pre-processing pipeline, including tokenization, standardization, and noise removal. It clearly labeled the CSE corpus for the pp-container prediction task. Three thousand, eight hundred and eighty sentences were named as a pp-compartment. The final dataset had a good balance after it completed the annotation task. To enhance accuracy and context-awareness in chatbot responses, back propagation and an Apriori algorithm are used. It is essential to consider a combination of techniques that target different aspects of the chatbot’s operation. The work improves accuracy by 6.4% and context-awareness by 11.4% compared to previous efforts. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Dr Gururaj H L, Dr Janhavi V and Ambika V individual chapters, the contributors.",2024,,Social Engineering in Cybersecurity: Threats and Defenses,,,155-170,,10.1201/9781003406716-9,,#5171,Ambika 2024,,,0
Exploring the potential of mobile health interventions to address behavioural risk factors for the prevention of non-communicable diseases in Asian populations: a qualitative study,"Mair, J.L.; Castro, O.; Salamanca-Sanabria, A.; Frese, B.F.; von Wangenheim, F.; Tai, E.S.; Kowatsch, T.; Müller-Riemenschneider, F.","Background: Changing lifestyle patterns over the last decades have seen growing numbers of people in Asia affected by non-communicable diseases and common mental health disorders, including diabetes, cancer, and/or depression. Interventions targeting healthy lifestyle behaviours through mobile technologies, including new approaches such as chatbots, may be an effective, low-cost approach to prevent these conditions. To ensure uptake and engagement with mobile health interventions, however, it is essential to understand the end-users’ perspectives on using such interventions. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions, barriers, and facilitators to the use of mobile health interventions for lifestyle behaviour change in Singapore. Methods: Six virtual focus group discussions were conducted with a total of 34 participants (mean ± SD; aged 45 ± 3.6 years; 64.7% females). Focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach, followed by deductive mapping according to perceptions, barriers, facilitators, mixed factors, or strategies. Results: Five themes were identified: (i) holistic wellbeing is central to healthy living (i.e., the importance of both physical and mental health); (ii) encouraging uptake of a mobile health intervention is influenced by factors such as incentives and government backing; (iii) trying out a mobile health intervention is one thing, sticking to it long term is another and there are key factors, such as personalisation and ease of use that influence sustained engagement with mobile health interventions; (iv) perceptions of chatbots as a tool to support healthy lifestyle behaviour are influenced by previous negative experiences with chatbots, which might hamper uptake; and (v) sharing health-related data is OK, but with conditions such as clarity on who will have access to the data, how it will be stored, and for what purpose it will be used. Conclusions: Findings highlight several factors that are relevant for the development and implementation of mobile health interventions in Singapore and other Asian countries. Recommendations include: (i) targeting holistic wellbeing, (ii) tailoring content to address environment-specific barriers, (iii) partnering with government and/or local (non-profit) institutions in the development and/or promotion of mobile health interventions, (iv) managing expectations regarding the use of incentives, and (iv) identifying potential alternatives or complementary approaches to the use of chatbots, particularly for mental health. © 2023, The Author(s).",2023,,BMC Public Health,23,1,,,10.1186/s12889-023-15598-8,,#5172,Mair 2023,,,0
The hallucinating chatbot ‘ChatGPT’ poorly estimates real bird commonness,"Żmihorski, M.","Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of increasingly sophisticated chatbot technologies, with ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, gaining significant popularity. As public awareness of environmental issues has grown during recent decades, there is an increasing demand for access to information about the environment. ChatGPT which offers free, real-time information via a user-friendly interface, has the potential to fill this gap. However, empirical evaluations of reliability and quality of information provided by chatbots are needed. In this study, the biological information provided by GPT-3.5 is evaluated. The commonness indices of 199 bird species in Poland, estimated by the ChatGPT, are correlated with the real commonness indices obtained during ornithological survey conducted across 700 1 × 1 km squares. Bird commonness indices provided by ChatGPT were generally positively correlated (r ≤ 0.6) with bird abundance and occurrence. However, this correlation was not particularly strong. Correlation was especially poor for less common species (i.e., below 1000 individuals recorded during bird monitoring), and some of rare or very rare species were incorrectly identified by ChatGPT as relatively common. Moreover, ChatGPT seemed confident, realistic and persuasive in providing obviously incorrect responses (possibly due to lack of training data), much like it would for correct responses. Generating such false responses due to data deficiency is commonly referred to as “hallucination” of a chatbot. While chatbots can potentially be powerful tools for delivering environmental information, better control over the training process is necessary. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Biological Conservation,288,,,,10.1016/j.biocon.2023.110371,,#5173,Żmihorski 2023,,,0
Reducing the Gap Between Theory and Applications in Algorithmic Bayesian Persuasion,"Castiglioni, M.","This work focuses on the following question: is it possible to influence the behavior of self-interested agents through the strategic provision of information? This ‘sweet talk’ is ubiquitous among all sorts of economics and non-economics activities. In this work, we model these multi-agent systems as games between an informed sender and one or multiple receivers. We study the computational problem faced by an informed sender that wants to use his information advantage to influence rational receivers with the partial disclosure of information. In particular, the sender faces an information structure design problem that amounts to deciding ‘who gets to know what’. Bayesian persuasion provides a formal framework to model these settings as asymmetric-information games. In recent years, much attention has been given to Bayesian persuasion in the economics and artificial intelligence communities due also to the applicability of this framework to a large class of scenarios like online advertising, voting, traffic routing, recommendation systems, security, and product marketing. However, there is still a large gap between the theoretical study of information in games and its applications in real-world scenarios. This work contributes to close this gap along two directions. First, we study the persuasion problem in real-world scenarios, focusing on voting, routing, and auctions. While the Bayesian persuasion framework can be applied to all these settings, the algorithmic problem of designing optimal information disclosure polices introduces computational challenges related to the specific problem under study. Our goal is to settle the complexity of computing optimal sender’s strategies, showing when an optimal strategy can be implemented efficiently. Then, we relax stringent assumptions that limit the applicability of the Bayesian persuasion framework in practice. In particular, the classical model assumes that the sender has perfect knowledge of the receiver’s utility. We remove this assumption initiating the study of an online version of the persuasion problem. This is the first step in designing adaptive information disclosure policies that deal with the uncertainty intrinsic in all real-world applications. © The Author(s) 2024.",2024,,SpringerBriefs in Applied Sciences and Technology,Part F2456,,Mar-13,,10.1007/978-3-031-51500-2_1,,#5175,Castiglioni 2024,,,0

Speculative Design with Generative AI: Applying Stable Diffusion and ChatGPT to imagining climate change futures,"Lc, R.A.Y.; Tang, Y.","Policy mandates in addressing climate change are hindered by a lack of intrinsic motivation amongst participants to take collective action. Instead of overt persuasion, this study applied generative AI tools to speculative imagining of future climate scenarios and their adaptation strategies, using a workshop to encourage participants to align themselves with climate action. Participants used text-to-image tools to generate visions of the future in speculative scenarios, then prompted ChatGPT for potential solutions in these scenarios. They then asked text-to-image again to visualize the ChatGPT suggestions. Participants encountered difficulties editing or removing visual elements, dealt with the lack of transparency in the generation process by specifying the physical layout as opposed to the semantics, and collaboratively developed linguistic strategies for visual depiction of novel artifacts. This work shows how generative tools can be used to prototype future scenarios and envision designs that serve social purposes.  © 2023 ACM.",2023,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,,,10.1145/3632776.3632827,,#5178,Lc 2023,,,0
Fibrous mats based skin sensor with ultra-sensitivity and anti-overshooting dynamic stability enhanced with artificial intelligence,"Chen, H.; Zhou, J.; Long, X.; Zhuo, F.; Liu, Y.; Zhao, Y.; Xie, J.; Duan, H.; Fu, Y.","Next generation epidermal and wearable strain sensors are rapidly emerged as promising candidates for personalized medicine, soft machines, and human–machine interfaces. However, overshooting issues of these flexible strain sensors are major concerns during their dynamic strain monitoring, which often cause signal distortion and non-monotonic sensing characteristics. In addition, achieving a high sensitivtiy of these strain sensors within a full-body motion strain range (0–200%) remains a critical challenge. Herein, a conductive electrospun fibrous mats which are consisted of graphene anchored into fibrous thermoplastic polyurethane is proposed to endow strain sensors with anti-overshooting performance (or a good dynamic stability) and high sensitivity within full-body motion monitoring range. An overshooting-to-stable transition for the sensor's electrical performance is observed by controlling the contents of conductive agents and substrate, which is elucidated by the kinetic changing behaviors of conductive pathways along the longitudinal and transverse strain directions. By strengthening the interaction forces between fillers and matrix, the conduction pathways are capable of rapidly switching to disconnection in response to external strains, thus achieving an ultrahigh sensitivity. The developed skin sensing platform is capable of detecting full range physiological signals and achieving healthcare Internet of Things in achilles tendon rehabilitation.

Symbiotic Artificial and Human Cognitive Architectures Managing Human Attention,"Pederson, T.; Mishra, A.K.","Wearable digital technologies such as Augmented Reality glasses offer a unique platform not only for monitoring proxies of individual human behaviour data (e.g. eye and body limb movements, posture, location, skin conductivity) but also for affecting behaviour, as instances of persuasive technologies often used to achieve personal human goals, e.g. for integrating physical exercise into everyday life. For artificial computational systems to gracefully affect in-situ human behavior is however associated with several challenges. It requires carefully interfacing digital processes running on the wearable device(s) with biological processes taking place inside the human body (e.g. cognitive, perceptual, motoric). It also needs to work within the constraints of engineering viability, user experience, and ethical constraints. We present our initial attempts to synchronize human biological visual attention processes with eye tracking-based visual stimuli generation in two application domains: for counteracting racial discrimination in the assessment of job applications, and for facilitating assembly tasks. Characteristic for both approaches is that the persuasion is aimed at being completely unnoticeable, at least in the long-term. We then move on to initial ideas for a more general model for integrating perceptual and cognitive functions across the biological-digital border to optimize the system as a whole. More specifically, today’s AI architectures have a hard time achieving human-like high level cognition and perception which, we would argue, could potentially be addressed by a carefully designed symbiotic information exchange between existing human biological symbolic processes run inside the human brain with digital Machine Learning ones being tasked with the simpler sub-symbolic processing.

Constraint Representation Towards Precise Data-Driven Storytelling,"Shi, Y.-Z.; Li, H.; Ruan, L.; Qu, H.","Data-driven storytelling serves as a crucial bridge for communicating ideas in a persuasive way. However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence.

The empirical analysis is conducted using extensive order data from a major beauty care product manufacturer and distributor, covering the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. The findings reveal that it is primarily the increase in demand volatility, and not the surge in sales volume, that has led to an increase in forecasting errors. This research provides crucial insights into the nuanced effects of macroeconomic shocks and consumer behavior changes on AI-based forecasting within the beauty care industry. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive forecasting errors, paving the way for more resilient and robust demand forecasting systems in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review,180,,,,10.1016/j.tre.2023.103360,,#5193,Jackson 2023,,,0
Characterizing Manipulation from AI Systems,"Carroll, M.; Chan, A.; Ashton, H.; Krueger, D.","Manipulation is a concern in many domains, such as social media, advertising, and chatbots. As AI systems mediate more of our digital interactions, it is important to understand the degree to which AI systems might manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Our work clarifies challenges in defining and measuring this kind of manipulation from AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation and characterize the space of possible notions of manipulation, which we find to depend upon the concepts of incentives, intent, covertness, and harm. We review proposals on how to operationalize each concept and we outline challenges in including each concept in a definition of manipulation. Second, we discuss the connections between manipulation and related concepts, such as deception and coercion. We then analyze how our characterization of manipulation applies to recommender systems and language models, and give a brief overview of the regulation of manipulation in other domains. While some progress has been made in defining and measuring manipulation from AI systems, many gaps remain. In the absence of a consensus definition and reliable tools for measurement, we cannot rule out the possibility that AI systems learn to manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Manipulation could pose a significant threat to human autonomy and precautionary actions to mitigate it are likely warranted. © 2023 Owner/Author.",2023,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,,,10.1145/3617694.3623226,,#5196,Carroll 2023,,,0

Effects of AI and Logic-Style Explanations on Users’ Decisions Under Different Levels of Uncertainty,"Cau, F.M.; Hauptmann, H.; Spano, L.D.; Tintarev, N.","Existing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques support people in interpreting AI advice. However, although previous work evaluates the users’ understanding of explanations, factors influencing the decision support are largely overlooked in the literature. This article addresses this gap by studying the impact of user uncertainty, AI correctness, and the interaction between AI uncertainty and explanation logic-styles for classification tasks. We conducted two separate studies: one requesting participants to recognize handwritten digits and one to classify the sentiment of reviews. To assess the decision making, we analyzed the task performance, agreement with the AI suggestion, and the user’s reliance on the XAI interface elements. Participants make their decision relying on three pieces of information in the XAI interface (image or text instance, AI prediction, and explanation). Participants were shown one explanation style (between-participants design) according to three styles of logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, and abductive). This allowed us to study how different levels of AI uncertainty influence the effectiveness of different explanation styles. The results show that user uncertainty and AI correctness on predictions significantly affected users’ classification decisions considering the analyzed metrics. In both domains (images and text), users relied mainly on the instance to decide. Users were usually overconfident about their choices, and this evidence was more pronounced for text. Furthermore, the inductive style explanations led to overreliance on the AI advice in both domains—it was the most persuasive, even when the AI was incorrect. The abductive and deductive styles have complex effects depending on the domain and the AI uncertainty levels. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)",2023,,ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,13,4,,,10.1145/3588320,,#5198,Cau 2023,,,0
Transforming respiratory diseases management: a CMO-based hospital pharmaceutical care model,"Zarate-Tamames, B.; Garin, N.; Calvin-Lamas, M.; Jornet, S.; Martinez-Simon, J.J.; Garcia-Gil, S.; Garcia-Rebolledo, E.M.; Morillo-Verdugo, R.","Introduction: Respiratory diseases encompass a diverse range of conditions that significantly impact global morbidity and mortality. While common diseases like asthma and COPD exhibit moderate symptoms, less prevalent conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and cystic fibrosis profoundly affect quality of life and mortality. The prevalence of these diseases has surged by approximately 40% over the past 3 decades. Despite advancements in pharmacotherapy, challenges in drug administration, adherence, and adverse effects persist. This study aimed to develop and perform an interim validation of a Capacity-Motivation-Opportunity (CMO) model tailored for respiratory outpatients to enhance pharmaceutical care, which is the direct, responsible provision of medication-related care for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient’s quality of life, and overall wellbeing. Methodology: This cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted from March 2022 to March 2023. It comprised four phases: 1) forming an expert panel of 15 hospital pharmacists, 2) selecting respiratory pathologies based on prevalence and severity, 3) developing the CMO model’s pillars, and 4) integrating and conducting an interim validation of the model. The Capacity pillar focused on patient stratification and personalized care; the Motivation pillar aligned therapeutic goals through motivational interviewing; and the Opportunity pillar promoted the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for telemedicine. Results: The model included eight respiratory diseases based on expert assessment. For the Capacity pillar, 22 variables were defined for patient stratification, leading to three priority levels for personalized pharmaceutical care. In a preliminary test involving 201 patients across six hospitals, the stratification tool effectively classified patients according to their needs. The Motivation pillar adapted motivational interviewing techniques to support patient adherence and behavior change. The Opportunity pillar established teleconsultation protocols and ICT tools to enhance patient monitoring and care coordination. Conclusion: The CMO model, tailored for respiratory patients, provides a comprehensive framework for improving pharmaceutical care. By focusing on patient-centered care, aligning therapeutic goals, and leveraging technology, this model addresses the multifaceted needs of individuals with respiratory conditions. Future studies are necessary to validate this model in other healthcare systems and ensure its broad applicability.

Precision Medicine in Depression: The Role of Proteomics and Metabolomics in Personalized Treatment Approaches,"Jaber, M.; Kahwaji, H.; Nasr, S.; Baz, R.; Kim, Y.-K.; Fakhoury, M.","Depression, or major depressive disorder (MDD), is a widespread mental health condition marked by enduring feelings of sorrow and loss of interest. Treatment of depression frequently combines psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. However, the occurrence of treatment resistance in certain individuals makes it difficult for physicians to effectively manage this disorder, calling for the implementation of alternative therapeutic strategies. Recently, precision medicine has gained increased attention in the field of mental health, paving the way for more personalized and effective therapeutic interventions in depression. Also known as personalized medicine, this approach relies on genetic composition, molecular profiles, and environmental variables to customize therapies to individual patients. In particular, precision medicine has offered novel viewpoints on depression through two specific domains: proteomics and metabolomics. On one hand, proteomics is the thorough study of proteins in a biological system, while metabolomics focuses on analyzing the complete set of metabolites in a living being. In the past few years, progress in research has led to the identification of numerous depression-related biomarkers using proteomics and metabolomics techniques, allowing for early identification, precise diagnosis, and improved clinical outcome. However, despite significant progress in these techniques, further efforts are required for advancing precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of depression. The overarching goal of this chapter is to provide the current state of knowledge regarding the use of proteomics and metabolomics in identifying biomarkers related to depression. It also highlights the potential of proteomics and metabolomics in elucidating the intricate processes underlying depression, opening the door for tailored therapies that could eventually enhance clinical outcome in depressed patients. This chapter finally discusses the main challenges in the use of proteomics and metabolomics and discusses potential future research directions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.",2024,,Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology,1456,,359-378,,10.1007/978-981-97-4402-2_18,,#5203,Jaber 2024,,,0

Increasing physical activity using an just-in-time adaptive digital assistant supported by machine learning: A novel approach for hyper-personalised mHealth interventions,"Vandelanotte, C.; Trost, S.; Hodgetts, D.; Imam, T.; Rashid, M.; To, Q.G.; Maher, C.","Objective: Physical inactivity is a leading modifiable cause of death and disease worldwide. Population-based interventions to increase physical activity are needed. Existing automated expert systems (e.g., computer-tailored interventions) have significant limitations that result in low long-term effectiveness. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. This special communication aims to describe and discuss a novel mHealth intervention approach that proactively offers participants with hyper-personalised intervention content adjusted in real-time. Methods: Using machine learning approaches, we propose a novel physical activity intervention approach that can learn and adapt in real-time to achieve high levels of personalisation and user engagement, underpinned by a likeable digital assistant. It will consist of three major components: (1) conversations: to increase user's knowledge on a wide range of activity-related topics underpinned by Natural Language Processing; (2) nudge engine: to provide users with hyper-personalised cues to action underpinned by reinforcement learning (i.e., contextual bandit) and integrating real-time data from activity tracking, GPS, GIS, weather, and user provided data; (3) Q&A: to facilitate users asking any physical activity related questions underpinned by generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard) for content generation. Results: The detailed concept of the proposed physical activity intervention platform demonstrates the practical application of a just-in-time adaptive intervention applying various machine learning techniques to deliver a hyper-personalised physical activity intervention in an engaging way. Compared to traditional interventions, the novel platform is expected to show potential for increased user engagement and long-term effectiveness due to: (1) using new variables to personalise content (e.g., GPS, weather), (2) providing behavioural support at the right time in real-time, (3) implementing an engaging digital assistant and (4) improving the relevance of content through applying machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: The use of machine learning is on the rise in every aspect of today's society, however few attempts have been undertaken to harness its potential to achieve health behaviour change. By sharing our intervention concept, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on creating effective methods for promoting health and well-being in the informatics research community.

Using ChatGPT and Persuasive Technology for Personalized Recommendation Messages in Hotel Upselling,"Remountakis, M.; Kotis, K.; Kourtzis, B.; Tsekouras, G.E.","Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity, and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present pilot experiments with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. Our inhouse commercial hotel marketing platform, eXclusivi, was extended with a new software module working with ChatGPT prompts and persuasive ads created for its recommendations. In particular, we developed an intelligent advertisement (ad) copy generation tool for the hotel marketing platform. The proposed approach allows for the hotel team to target all guests in their language, leveraging the integration with the hotel’s reservation system.

An electronic Personal Health Record (ePHR) can help patients by maintaining a history of healthcare data from various centers. The purposes of this research were to develop a minimum data set (MDS) to design an ePHR for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using design science methodology and to identify the necessary measures for a smooth ePHR implementation in Iran. Methods: This study was performed in Kerman from February 2020 to October 2021. To inform caregivers about ePHRs, information sessions were held and a pictorial method was used. Then, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven physicians and 13 caregivers involved in the care of Alzheimer's patients. Using thematic analysis based on the Information System Research (ISR) framework, the data were encoded and analyzed. Results: The MDS of an ePHR for AD contained 178 data elements, categorized into six main sections. The participants considered the use of an ePHR essential to achieve quality care. Using an ePHR can serve as the main method of collecting accurate histories of each Alzheimer's patient in different disease stages and monitoring their behavioral changes. Data confidentiality and security were considered as one of the main measures for AD ePHR implementation.

Influence maximization in social networks using discrete BAT-modified (DBATM) optimization algorithm: a computationally intelligent viral marketing approach,"Aggarwal, K.; Arora, A.","Viral marketing relies on a set of users who have characteristics to rapidly increase the propagation of information. In viral marketing, information reaches and is shared by the public at large rather than a targeted audience. Thus, the study of influence spread for viral marketing needs the interest of researchers. Influence maximization challenges such as large graph and NP-hard problem have created a need to reconfigure this research issue. The selection of an influential set of users is a well-known influence maximization research problem which is a discrete problem. Therefore, at the beginning of this work, the standard BAT algorithm is transformed into a discrete BAT algorithm (DBAT). Further, a novel discrete BAT-modified (DBATM) algorithm is introduced as an optimized solution to the influence maximization problem. To validate the influence spread performance of the proposed DBATM algorithm, three diverse datasets are experimented using two social network influence maximization techniques—page rank and node rank—and two computational intelligence algorithms—DBAT and DBATM. Experimental outcomes illustrate and posit the fast convergence and maximum influence spread using the computational intelligence optimization algorithm DBATM over all other considered techniques. Even, DBATM performs better than DBAT in terms of the stability as well. Hence, the proposed optimization DBATM algorithm used for the detection of influential users is effective and persuasive for viral marketing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Social Network Analysis and Mining,13,1,,,10.1007/s13278-023-01151-3,,#5218,Aggarwal 2023,,,0
Digital health interventions in dermatology—Mapping technology and study parameters of systematically identified publications,"Reinders, P.; Augustin, M.; Kirsten, N.; Fleyder, A.; Otten, M.","Digital health interventions (DHI) potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of dermatological care. Currently, an overview clustering and characterizing the evidence on DHIs is missing. This systematic mapping of the literature aims to analyse published research on DHIs in dermatology to identify trends and gaps in research. For this purpose, a systematic search of the MEDLINE database was conducted in August 2022 to identify original publications on DHIs in dermatology. Data on country, targeted audience, DHI category, indication, outcome parameter and study design were extracted. Out of 12,009 records identified in MEDLINE, 403 studies were included in the final analysis. Studies on DHIs mainly performed in western countries, headed by the United States (n = 133), Germany (n = 32) and Spain (n = 23). Of all identified DHIs, 261 targeted healthcare providers (HCP), 66 clients (e.g. patients, caregivers, healthy individuals) and 67 both clients and HCPs. A majority of DHIs focussed on establishing a diagnosis (n = 254). Every other study analysed store-and-forward teledermatology (n = 187), followed by artificial intelligence applications for image analysis (n = 65). The most often analysed DHI category for clients was a support of health behaviour change (n = 31). Monitoring of clients was targeted by 77 studies. Skin cancer (n = 148), wounds (n = 29) and psoriasis (n = 29) were the most targeted indications by DHIs. Most studies analysed diagnostic performance (n = 166), fewer studies analysed acceptance (n = 92) and effectiveness (n = 98). Usability (n = 32) and efficiency (n = 36) were investigated only to a small extent. Studies on DHIs in dermatology have focused on teledermatology and AI applications, with an emphasis on skin cancer diagnosis. Apart from that, a range of DHIs for different user groups, purposes and indications were identified, demonstrating the broad potential for DHIs in dermatology. Further research with a wider set of outcome parameters is needed to fully understand the potential of DHIs and ensure their sustainable implementation into dermatological care. © 2023 The Authors.

Effect of an avatar-based discharge education application on knowledge and behaviour in people after acute coronary syndrome: protocol for a pragmatic prospective randomised controlled trial,"Ellis, T.; Cheng, S.; Zecchin, R.; Zwack, C.; Hyun, K.; Zhang, L.; Gallagher, R.; Clark, R.; Redfern, J.","Introduction Many hospital presentations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) occur in people previously hospitalised with coronary heart disease (CHD), leading to increased costs and health burden. Secondary prevention education including a prehospital discharge plan is recommended for all individuals to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, many clinicians lack the time or support to provide education, and patients' uptake of secondary prevention programmes is limited. An avatar-based education app is a novel and engaging way to provide self-delivered, evidence-based secondary prevention information during the hospital admission and remains accessible after discharge. This protocol aims to evaluate the effect of an avatar-based education app on individuals with ACS. Methods and analysis This protocol describes a prospective, randomised controlled trial with 3-month follow-up and blinded assessment of 72 participants. Intervention group participants will download the app onto their own device during the hospital admission and independently complete six interactive education modules based on the National Heart Foundation's six steps to cardiac recovery. All participants will receive a text message reminder of the study after 3 weeks. Both groups will receive usual care consisting of bedside education and a pamphlet about cardiac rehabilitation. The primary outcome is knowledge of CHD, assessed using the Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire II. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, response to heart attack symptoms, cardiac-related readmissions and mortality and modifiable cardiac risk factors.

VISAR: A Human-AI Argumentative Writing Assistant with Visual Programming and Rapid Draft Prototyping,"Zhang, Z.; Gao, J.; Dhaliwal, R.S.; Li, T.J.-J.","In argumentative writing, writers must brainstorm hierarchical writing goals, ensure the persuasiveness of their arguments, and revise and organize their plans through drafting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping. A controlled lab study confirmed the usability and effectiveness of VISAR in facilitating the argumentative writing planning process.  © 2023 ACM.",2023,,UIST 2023 - Proceedings of the 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,,,,,10.1145/3586183.3606800,,#5224,Zhang 2023,,,0
Realizing the Promise of AI Governance Involving Humans-in-the-Loop,"McKay, M.H.","Human-in-the-loop (“HITL”) approaches have been proposed as an important element to ensure safety and fairness for higher-risk applications of artificial intelligence (“AI”) enabled decision-making. This paper examines the question: To what extent does the current state of knowledge enable the definition of factors and mitigations necessary for the effective implementation of HITL approaches? Previous research examining internal (individual) and external (implementation-related structural and contextual) factors in human decision-making are surveyed and assessed for potential relevance. This analysis highlights factors likely to be of relevance and reveals gaps which hinder the elaboration of factors and mitigations relevant to the effectiveness of HITL approaches. In order to realize the potential for HITL approaches to enhance safety for those reliant on or subject to AI systems, governance implementation will need to include minimum requirements applicable to both human overseers and to the context in which they work and are assessed. Factors identified as relevant include: complacency, persuasion, workload, conformity, unequal treatment of different kinds of error, and organizational polices and norms which may deter thorough review and human challenge of AI recommendations. There is also a need for further research: to enhance understanding of the practical significance of HITL effectiveness risks factors and their management; to enable the classification of HITL-implementation environments; and, to provide robust measurement methodologies to enable the identification of the most promising human candidates for HITL overseer roles. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics) ,15382 LNCS,,107-123,,10.1007/978-3-031-76827-9_7,,#5225,McKay 2024,,,0
Witnessing: iteration and social change,"McPherson, E.","At first thought, iteration seems banal. It is about repeating the existing; nothing is changing. But this special issue shows that, in an era obsessed with the new, it is often the repetition of the old that creates social change. Iteration fosters persuasion. It affords opportunities for critical and creative engagement with meaning, values and knowledge. It invites collaboration, though its apparent simplicity often belies a tremendous amount of individual and collective labour involved in the practices of iteration. Through its repetition of the existing, however, iteration also can be a mechanism for reproducing the status quo. Its pervasiveness and banality naturalises power, and its mimetic qualities shrink spaces for critical distance and care. The editors of this special issue have brought together a delightful and fascinating diversity of articles focussed on iteration in cultural production in the digital age. We hop across geographies to examine lockdown diaries, artists’ books, socialist memes, fake news, the design of social media platforms and artificial intelligence, activism, film, social media forum moderation, news website reader comments and more. Iterating through the collection as a whole, across its many disciplines, is a commitment to theorising through empirical evidence, to explaining with critique, and to providing pathways to praxis. These characteristics of this special issue, and the many concepts and arguments it puts forward, make this collection of work exceptionally rich material for seeing iteration and how it shapes the world we live in today, as well as the world we want it to be. In this preface, I take a media sociology approach to show how iteration can be usefully understood as collaborative communication for change. I see this understanding of iteration, whose ascendancy is related to the ascendancy of computer science, as baked into the form of communication technologies—and thus as shaping the kinds of iteration that are possible when we use these technologies. This understanding also prompts us to focus on the connection between iteration and social change. To explore how this works, I analytically slow down the practice of iteration to show that it is a communication practice of transmission. That transmission practice is itself constituted of cognate communication practices—the reception, evaluation and production of knowledge—in which visibility and persuasion are key. In the latter parts of the preface, I illustrate this through the example of witnessing as iteration, as the high-stakes nature of witnessing make it a canary in the coalmine, more generally, for mediated communication in the digital age. I show how breaking the witnessing practice down into its various parts allows us to see how power enters and inflects who and what are iterated, when—and who and what are not. Thinking critically with iteration and against unequal power relations, the praxis this preface suggests is one—much in line with the rest of this special issue—of explaining how iteration might move the grassroots towards their goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2023,,AI and Society,38,5,1987-1995,,10.1007/s00146-022-01508-w,,#5226,McPherson 2023,,,0
Exploring the design and utility of an integrated web-based chatbot for young adults to support healthy eating: a qualitative study,"Ashton, L.M.; Adam, M.T.; Whatnall, M.; Rollo, M.E.; Burrows, T.L.; Hansen, V.; Collins, C.E.","Background: There is a lack of understanding of the potential utility of a chatbot integrated into a website to support healthy eating among young adults. Therefore, the aim was to interview key informants regarding potential utility and design of a chatbot to: (1) increase young adults’ return rates and engagement with a purpose-built healthy eating website and, (2) improve young adults’ diet quality. Methods: Eighteen qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted across three stakeholder groups: (i) experts in dietary behaviour change in young adults (n = 6), (ii) young adult users of a healthy eating website (n = 7), and (iii) experts in chatbot design (n = 5). Interview questions were guided by a behaviour change framework and a template analysis was conducted using NVivo. Results: Interviewees identified three potential roles of a chatbot for supporting healthy eating in young adults; R1: improving healthy eating knowledge and facilitating discovery, R2: reducing time barriers related to healthy eating, R3: providing support and social engagement. To support R1, the following features were suggested: F1: chatbot generated recommendations and F2: triage to website information or externally (e.g., another website) to address current user needs. For R2, suggested features included F3: nudge or behavioural prompts at critical moments and F4: assist users to navigate healthy eating websites. Finally, to support R3 interviewees recommended the following features: F5: enhance interactivity, F6: offer useful anonymous support, F7: facilitate user connection with content in meaningful ways and F8: outreach adjuncts to website (e.g., emails). Additional ‘general’ chatbot features included authenticity, personalisation and effective and strategic development, while the preferred chatbot style and language included tailoring (e.g., age and gender), with a positive and professional tone. Finally, the preferred chatbot message subjects included training (e.g., would you like to see a video to make this recipe?), enablement (e.g., healthy eating doesn’t need to be expensive, we’ve created a budget meal plan, want to see?) and education or informative approaches (e.g., “Did you know bananas are high in potassium which can aid in reducing blood pressure?”). Conclusion: Findings can guide chatbot designers and nutrition behaviour change researchers on potential chatbot roles, features, style and language and messaging in order to support healthy eating knowledge and behaviours in young adults. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",2023,,International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity,20,1,,,10.1186/s12966-023-01511-4,,#5227,Ashton 2023,,,0

"Hi Model, generating “nice” instead of “good” is not as bad as generating “rice”! Towards Context and Semantic Infused Dialogue Generation Loss Function","Tiwari, A.; Sinan, M.; Roy, K.; Sheth, A.; Saha, S.; Bhattacharyya, P.","Over the past two decades, dialogue modeling has made significant strides, moving from simple rule-based responses to personalized and persuasive response generation. However, despite these advancements, the objective functions and evaluation metrics for dialogue generation have remained stagnant. These lexical-based metrics, e.g., cross-entropy and BLEU, have two key limitations: (a) word-to-word matching without semantic consideration: It assigns the same credit for failure to generate “nice” and “rice” for “good”, (b) missing context attribute for evaluating the generated response: Even if a generated response is relevant to the ongoing dialogue context, it may still be penalized for not matching the gold utterance provided in the corpus. In this paper, we first investigate these limitations comprehensively and propose a new loss function called Semantic Infused Contextualized diaLogue (SemTextualLogue) loss function. We also formulate an evaluation metric called Dialuation, incorporating both context and semantic relevance. We experimented with both non-pretrained and pre-trained models on two dialogue corpora, encompassing task-oriented and open-domain scenarios. We found that the dialogue generation models trained with SemTextualLogue loss attained superior performance compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. Tshe findings establish that the effective training of a dialogue generation model hinges significantly on incorporating semantics and context. This pattern is also mirrored in the introduced Dialuation metric, where the consideration of both context and semantics correlates more strongly with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics (The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/SemTextualLogue-Loss). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",2024,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14948 LNAI,,342-360,,10.1007/978-3-031-70371-3_20,,#5229,Tiwari 2024,,,0
Exploiting Large Language Models (LLMs) through Deception Techniques and Persuasion Principles,"Singh, S.; Abri, F.; Namin, A.S.","With the recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT from OpenAI, BARD from Google, Llama2 from Meta, and Claude from Anthropic AI, gain widespread use, ensuring their security and robustness is critical. The widespread use of these language models heavily relies on their reliability and proper usage of this fascinating technology. It is crucial to thoroughly test these models to not only ensure its quality but also possible misuses of such models by potential adversaries for illegal activities such as hacking. This paper presents a novel study focusing on exploitation of such large language models against deceptive interactions. More specifically, the paper leverages widespread and borrows well-known techniques in deception theory to investigate whether these models are susceptible to deceitful interactions. This research aims not only to highlight these risks but also to pave the way for robust countermeasures that enhance the security and integrity of language models in the face of sophisticated social engineering tactics. Through systematic experiments and analysis, we assess their performance in these critical security domains. Our results demonstrate a significant finding in that these large language models are susceptible to deception and social engineering attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,"Proceedings - 2023 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, BigData 2023",,,2508-2517,,10.1109/BigData59044.2023.10386814,,#5231,Singh 2023,,,0
Monetization of customer futures through machine learning and artificial intelligence based persuasive technologies,"Bhattacharyya, S.S.","Purpose: The purpose of this study was to ascertain how real options investment perspective could be applied towards monetization of customer futures through the deployment of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based persuasive technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors embarked on a theoretical treatise as advocated by scholars (Cornelissen, 2019; Barney, 2018; Cornelissen, 2017; Smithey Fulmer, 2012; Bacharach, 1989; Whetten, 1989; Weick,1989). Towards this end, theoretical argumentative logic was incrementally used to build an integrated perspective on the deployment of learning and AI-based persuasive technologies. This was carried out with strategic real options investment perspective to secure customer futures on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Findings: M-commerce apps and e-commerce sites have been deploying ML and AI-based tools (referred to as persuasive technologies), to nudge customers for increased and quicker purchase. The primary objective was to increase engagement time of customers (at an individual level), grow the number of customers (at market level) and increase firm revenue (at an organizational level). The deployment of any persuasive technology entailed increased investment (cash outflow) but was also expected to increase the level of revenue and margin (cash inflow). Given the dynamics of market and the emergent nature of persuasive technologies, ascertaining favourable cash flow was challenging. Real options strategy provided a robust theoretical perspective to time the persuasive technology-related investment in stages. This helped managers to be on time with loading customer purchase with increased temporal immediacy. A real options investment space involving six spaces has also been developed in this conceptual work. These were Never Invest, Immediately Investment, Present-day Investment Possibility, Possibly Invest Later, Invest Probably Later and Possibly Never Invest. Research limitations/implications: The foundations of this study domain encompassed work done by an eclectic mix of scholars like from technology management (Siggelkow and Terwiesch, 2019a; Porter and Heppelmann, 2014), real options (Trigeorgis and Reuer, 2017; Luehrman, 1998a, 1998b), marketing intelligence and planning (Appel et al., 2020; Thaichon et al., 2019; Thaichon et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2019) and strategy from a demand positioning school of thought (Adner and Zemsky, 2006). Practical implications: The findings would help managers to comprehend what level of investments need to be done in a staggered manner. The phased way of investing towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies would enable better monetization of customer futures. This would aid marketing managers for increased customer engagement at the individual level, fast monetization of customer futures and increased number of customers and consumption on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Originality/value: This was one of the first studies to apply real options investment perspective towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies for monetizing customer futures. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,,Journal of Science and Technology Policy Management,14,4,734-757,,10.1108/JSTPM-09-2021-0136,,#5232,Bhattacharyya 2023,,,0
Synthetic Lies: Understanding AI-Generated Misinformation and Evaluating Algorithmic and Human Solutions,"Zhou, J.; Zhang, Y.; Luo, Q.; Parker, A.G.; De Choudhury, M.","Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human-like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation. © 2023 Owner/Author.",2023,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,,,,,10.1145/3544548.3581318,,#5235,Zhou 2023,,,0
Digital approaches to smoking cessation,"Meijer, E.; Mansour, M.B.L.","Mobile smoking-cessation apps are widely available. Apps of good quality are based on smoking-cessation guidelines and/or behaviour-change techniques, and ideally should be proven effective in improving smoking-cessation outcomes. Mobile interventions using text messages are effective in improving outcomes, while internet-based interventions are moderately effective. Some smoking-cessation apps show a positive effect on smoking-cessation outcomes, especially among users who use the app as intended. Combining digital interventions with usual smoking-cessation support appears beneficial and feasible, but evidence on effectiveness is mixed.

Algorithmic transparency and interpretability measures improve radiologists’ performance in BI-RADS 4 classification,"Jungmann, F.; Ziegelmayer, S.; Lohoefer, F.K.; Metz, S.; Müller-Leisse, C.; Englmaier, M.; Makowski, M.R.; Kaissis, G.A.; Braren, R.F.","Objective: To evaluate the perception of different types of AI-based assistance and the interaction of radiologists with the algorithm’s predictions and certainty measures. Methods: In this retrospective observer study, four radiologists were asked to classify Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System 4 (BI-RADS4) lesions (n = 101 benign, n = 99 malignant). The effect of different types of AI-based assistance (occlusion-based interpretability map, classification, and certainty) on the radiologists’ performance (sensitivity, specificity, questionnaire) were measured. The influence of the Big Five personality traits was analyzed using the Pearson correlation. Results: Diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved by AI-based assistance (an increase of 2.8% ± 2.3%, 95 %-CI 1.5 to 4.0 %, p = 0.045) and trust in the algorithm was generated primarily by the certainty of the prediction (100% of participants). Different human-AI interactions were observed ranging from nearly no interaction to humanization of the algorithm. High scores in neuroticism were correlated with higher persuasibility (Pearson’s r = 0.98, p = 0.02), while higher consciousness and change of accuracy showed an inverse correlation (Pearson’s r = −0.96, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Trust in the algorithm’s performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the predictions in combination with a plausible heatmap. Human-AI interaction varied widely and was influenced by personality traits. Key Points: • AI-based assistance significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists in classifying BI-RADS 4 mammography lesions. • Trust in the algorithm’s performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the prediction in combination with a reasonable heatmap. • Personality traits seem to influence human-AI collaboration. Radiologists with specific personality traits were more likely to change their classification according to the algorithm’s prediction than others. © 2022, The Author(s).",2023,,European Radiology,33,3,1844-1851,,10.1007/s00330-022-09165-9,,#5237,Jungmann 2023,,,0
Towards Cross-Content Conversational Agents for Behaviour Change: Investigating Domain Independence and the Role of Lexical Features in Written Language Around Change,"Meyer, S.; Elsweiler, D.","Valuable insights into an individual's current thoughts and stance regarding behaviour change can be obtained by analysing the language they use, which can be conceptualized using Motivational Interviewing concepts. Training conversational agents (CAs) to detect and employ these concepts could help them provide more personalized and effective assistance. This study investigates the similarity of written language around behaviour change spanning diverse conversational and social contexts and change objectives. Drawing on previous research that applied MI concepts to texts about health behaviour change, we evaluate the performance of existing classifiers on six newly constructed datasets from diverse contexts. To gain insights in determining factors when identifying change language, we explore the impact of lexical features on classification. The results suggest that patterns of change language remain stable across contexts and domains, leading us to conclude that peer-to-peer online data may be sufficient to train CAs to understand user utterances related to behaviour change.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",2023,,"Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces, CUI 2023",,,,,10.1145/3571884.3597136,,#5238,Meyer 2023,,,0

Investigating the Use of an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot with General Chemistry Exam Questions,"Clark, T.M.","The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT was used to answer questions from final exams administered in two general chemistry courses, including questions with closed-response format and with open-response format. For closed-response questions, ChatGPT was very capable at identifying the concept even when the question included a great deal of chemical symbolism. However, ChatGPT’s success at solving problems was only 44%, a value well below the class average of 69%. On open-response questions, ChatGPT’s responses displayed strong language processing ability with higher performance on questions that could be solved with more generalizable information compared to questions that required specific skills, especially when those topics or skills were primarily found in lecture. Incorrect responses and flawed explanations were often logically sound and would be persuasive to a novice.

Feasibility and Acceptability of Chatbots for Nutrition and Physical Activity Health Promotion among Adolescents: Systematic Scoping Review with Adolescent Consultation,"Han, R.; Todd, A.; Wardak, S.; Partridge, S.R.; Raeside, R.","Background: Reducing lifestyle risk behaviors among adolescents depends on access to age-appropriate health promotion information. Chatbots—computer programs designed to simulate conversations with human users—have the potential to deliver health information to adolescents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and support behavior change, but research on the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in the adolescent population is unknown. Objective: This systematic scoping review aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions among adolescents. A secondary aim is to consult adolescents to identify features of chatbots that are acceptable and feasible. Methods: We searched 6 electronic databases from March to April 2022 (MEDLINE, Embase, Joanna Briggs Institute, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Association for Computing Machinery library, and the IT database Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Peer-reviewed studies were included that were conducted in the adolescent population (10-19 years old) without any chronic disease, except obesity or type 2 diabetes, and assessed chatbots used nutrition or physical activity interventions or both that encouraged individuals to meet dietary or physical activity guidelines and support positive behavior change. Studies were screened by 2 independent reviewers, with any queries resolved by a third reviewer. Data were extracted into tables and collated in a narrative summary. Gray literature searches were also undertaken. Results of the scoping review were presented to a diverse youth advisory group (N=16, 13-18 years old) to gain insights into this topic beyond what is published in the literature. Results: The search identified 5558 papers, with 5 (0.1%) studies describing 5 chatbots meeting the inclusion criteria. The 5 chatbots were supported by mobile apps using a combination of the following features: personalized feedback, conversational agents, gamification, and monitoring of behavior change. Of the 5 studies, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on nutrition, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on physical activity, and 1 (20.0%) focused on both nutrition and physical activity. Feasibility and acceptability varied across the 5 studies, with usage rates above 50% in 3 (60.0%) studies. In addition, 3 (60.0%) studies reported health-related outcomes, with only 1 (20.0%) study showing promising effects of the intervention. Adolescents presented novel concerns around the use of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions, including ethical concerns and the use of false or misleading information. Conclusions: Limited research is available on chatbots in adolescent nutrition and physical activity interventions, finding insufficient evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of chatbots in the adolescent population. Similarly, adolescent consultation identified issues in the design features that have not been mentioned in the published literature. Therefore, chatbot codesign with adolescents may help ensure that such technology is feasible and acceptable to an adolescent population. ©Rui Han, Allyson Todd, Sara Wardak, Stephanie R Partridge, Rebecca Raeside.",2023,,JMIR Human Factors,10,,,,10.2196/43227,,#5243,Han 2023,,,0
Cocreation of a conversational agent to help patients adhere to their varenicline treatment: A study protocol,"Minian, N.; Mehra, K.; Rose, J.; Veldhuizen, S.; Zawertailo, L.; Ratto, M.; Lecce, J.; Selby, P.","Objective: Varenicline is the most efficacious approved smoking cessation medication, making it one of the most cost-effective clinical interventions for reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Adhering to varenicline is strongly associated with smoking cessation. Healthbots have the potential to help people adhere to their medications by scaling up evidence-based behavioral interventions. In this protocol, we outline how we will follow the UK's Medical Research Council's guidance to codesign a theory-informed, evidence-based, and patient-centered healthbot to help people adhere to varenicline. Methods: The study will utilize the Discover, Design and Build, and Test framework and will include three phases: (a) a rapid review and interviews with 20 patients and 20 healthcare providers to understand barriers and facilitators to varenicline adherence (Discover phase); (b) Wizard of Oz test to design the healthbot and get a sense of the questions that chatbot has to be able to answer (Design phase); and (c) building, training, and beta-testing the healthbot (Building and Testing phases) where the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability framework will be used to develop the healthbot using the simplest sensible solution, and 20 participants will beta test the healthbot. We will use the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model of behavior change and its associated framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework, to organize the findings. Conclusions: The present approach will enable us to systematically identify the most appropriate features for the healthbot based on a well-established behavioral theory, the latest scientific evidence, and end users’ and healthcare providers’ knowledge. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Digital Health,9,,,,10.1177/20552076231182807,,#5245,Minian 2023,,,0
Cognitive Learning: A New Paradigm for Machine Learning in Electromagnetic Spectrum Environment,"Ruan, T.-C.; Wu, Q.-H.; Zhao, S.-J.; Zhou, F.-H.; Huang, Y.","With the exponential growth in the number of wireless devices and wireless applications, and the emergence of various wireless technologies, the electromagnetic spectrum environment has presented complex characteristics such as multi-domain environments and situations, diverse applications, changeable behaviors, and dense signals. Spectrum resource control through immediate and effective analysis and processing of massive data is vital for efficient spectrum utilization and electromagnetic spectrum dominance. Intelligent technology represented by machine learning methods provides new opportunities to analyze electromagnetic spectrum data. Machine learning methods have been applied to wireless networks, spectrum management, resource management, and other scenarios. There are many challenges when applying machine learning to the electromagnetic spectrum environment. Because of the dynamically changing environment and tasks, the scarcity of high-quality labeled samples, real-time spectrum decision-making, and the difficulty of knowledge utilization and transfer in the electromagnetic spectrum environment, existing machine learning algorithms are not ideal for intelligent cognitive decision-making. Taking the research on interference recognition as an example, the traditional methods include two stages: signal feature extraction and pattern recognition. With the growth in computer computing power, deep learning techniques gradually replace traditional methods because of their powerful feature characterization capability. However, the electromagnetic spectrum environment and data often have uncertainties caused by unknown, dynamic changes. Adapting deep learning to unobserved tasks quickly is challenging, indicating poor generalization capability. Furthermore, it is limited by its reliance on a large number of high-quality labeled samples and manual adjustment of hyperparameters for offline training. Thus, although deep learning has far outperformed traditional methods in most research scenarios, traditional machine learning-based image recognition models still have advantages in some scenarios. In interference recognition, if traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms and their hyperparameters can be dynamically scheduled according to the environment and task characteristics, the shortcomings of using a single algorithm can be avoided, resulting in improved overall performance. It is necessary to propose a learning paradigm that continuously adapts to dynamic environments and tasks, accumulates new knowledge, is robust to erroneous sample data, and is partially interpretable. The leap from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence toward general artificial intelligence has research significance and practical value. Given the characteristics of the electromagnetic spectrum, this paper proposes a new paradigm of machine learning method in the electromagnetic spectrum environment—cognitive learning, attempting to use machine learning techniques at a“cognitive”level. It includes offline training, online execution, online feedback and offline self-learning processes, corresponding to the executive control and introspective processes of the brain's cognitive mechanisms. Offline training explores the matching relationship between the algorithm type and hyperparameters with the environment and the task. During the online process, it can perform decision-making based on the actual environment, select appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters, and output learning results. The feedback of learning results can be used for self-optimization in offline self-learning, forming an offline-online-offline structure. The cognitive feature extraction module establishes matching relationships between features of environments and tasks and algorithm types and hyperparameters to obtain the appropriate algorithm types and hyperparameters. The memory module calls specific algorithms and hyperparameter values for algorithm reconstruction. The learning network module executes the selected algorithm based on the input data and outputs online learning results. The cognitive evaluation module introspects the online learning results and adjusts the data in the memory database and cognitive case base, and updates the most appropriate algorithm and hyperparameters. In the offline stage, the current learning results are judged whether to be stored as a new cognitive case in the memory. The cognitive control module retrains the selection of algorithms and hyperparameters to continuously optimize the performance of selecting algorithms and hyperparameters. Moreover, we reveal and confirm the dynamic matching theorem and the optimal matching theorem in cognitive learning according to the No Free Lunch Theorem. The dynamic matching theorem states the existence and dynamics of optimal algorithms and hyperparameters. For any environment or task, there is always a set of algorithms and hyperparameters with optimal performance, which differs for different environments and tasks. The proposed cognitive learning paradigm can select appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters. The optimal matching theorem states that as the knowledge of algorithm and hyperparameter selection increases, the search space of candidate algorithm types and hyperparameters decreases, and the probability of selecting the most suitable algorithm type and hyperparameters increases. A cognitive learning scheme for radio frequency interference identification is designed. Different algorithms and hyperparameters are adopted for different problems to generate test results and a cognitive case base based on the differential task requirements and signal modalities acquired by cognitive feature extraction. A large number of cognitive cases are used as training samples to train the neural network for algorithm and hyperparameter selection. A radial basis function neural network is used for the neural network structure, which has the advantage that the number of hidden units does not need to be set manually. The size of hidden layers can be automatically expanded according to the approximate linear correlation criterion when the number of training samples for various problem features increases, alleviating the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. We performed interference recognition simulations with different datasets and different recognition requirements. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can adapt to dynamically changing environments and tasks, improve performance by self-learning, and alleviate the impact of mislabeled samples. The cognitive learning paradigm has a pioneering significance for developing machine learning methods applied to the electromagnetic spectrum environment. There remains room for improvement in cognitive learning. We must seek future research breakthroughs in multimodal computing, knowledge interpretability, large-scale tasks, and learning architecture scalability. © 2023 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

Continuous glucose monitoring for children with hypoglycaemia: Evidence in 2023,"Worth, C.; Hoskyns, L.; Salomon-Estebanez, M.; Nutter, P.W.; Harper, S.; Derks, T.G.J.; Beardsall, K.; Banerjee, I.","In 2023, childhood hypoglycaemia remains a major public health problem and significant risk factor for consequent adverse neurodevelopment. Irrespective of the underlying cause, key elements of clinical management include the detection, prediction and prevention of episodes of hypoglycaemia. These tasks are increasingly served by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices that measure subcutaneous glucose at near-continuous frequency. While the use of CGM in type 1 diabetes is well established, the evidence for widespread use in rare hypoglycaemia disorders is less than convincing. However, in the few years since our last review there have been multiple developments and increased user feedback, requiring a review of clinical application. Despite advances in device technology, point accuracy of CGM remains low for children with non-diabetes hypoglycaemia. Simple provision of CGM devices has not replicated the efficacy seen in those with diabetes and is yet to show benefit. Machine learning techniques for hypoglycaemia prevention have so far failed to demonstrate sufficient prediction accuracy for real world use even in those with diabetes. Furthermore, access to CGM globally is restricted by costs kept high by the commercially-driven speed of technical innovation. Nonetheless, the ability of CGM to digitally phenotype disease groups has led to a better understanding of natural history of disease, facilitated diagnoses and informed changes in clinical management. Large CGM datasets have prompted re-evaluation of hypoglycaemia incidence and facilitated improved trial design. Importantly, an individualised approach and focus on the behavioural determinants of hypoglycaemia has led to real world reduction in hypoglycaemia. In this state of the art review, we critically analyse the updated evidence for use of CGM in non-diabetic childhood hypoglycaemia disorders since 2020 and provide suggestions for qualified use.

Improving logical flow in English-as-a-foreign-language learner essays by reordering sentences,"Putra, J.W.G.; Teufel, S.; Tokunaga, T.","Argumentation is ubiquitous in everyday discourse, and it is a skill that can be learned. In our society, it is also one that must be learned: education systems all over the world agree on the importance of argumentation skills. However, writing effective argumentation is difficult, and even more so if it has to be expressed in a foreign language. Existing artificial intelligence systems for language learning can help learners: they can provide objective feedback (e.g., concerning grammar and spelling), as well as providing learners with opportunities to identify errors and subsequently improve their texts. Even so, systems aiming at higher discourse-level skills, such as persuasiveness and content organisation, are still limited. In this article, we propose the novel task of sentence reordering for improving the logical flow of argumentative essays. To train such a computational system, we present a new corpus called ICNALE-AS2R, containing essays written by English-as-foreign-language learners from various Asian countries, that have been annotated with argumentative structure and sentence reordering. We also propose a novel method to automatically reorder sentences in imperfect essays, which is based on argumentative structure analysis. Given an input essay and its corresponding argumentative structure, we cast the reordering task as a traversal problem. Our sentence reordering system first determines the pairwise ordering relation between pairs of sentences that are connected by argumentative relations. In the second step, the system traverses the argumentative structure that has been augmented with pairwise ordering information, in order to generate the final output text. Empirical evaluation shows that in the task of reconstructing the final reordered essays in the dataset, our reordering system achieves .926 and .879 in longest common subsequence ratio and Kendall's Tau metrics, respectively. The system is also able to perform the reordering operation selectively, that is, it reorders sentences when necessary and retains the original input order when it is already optimal. © 2023 The Author(s)",2023,,Artificial Intelligence,320,,,,10.1016/j.artint.2023.103935,,#5248,Putra 2023,,,0
Essential elements of weight loss apps for a multi-ethnic population with high BMI: a qualitative study with practical recommendations,"Chew, H.S.J.; Lim, S.L.; Kim, G.; Kayambu, G.; So, B.J.; Shabbir, A.; Gao, Y.","Smartphone weight loss apps are constantly being developed but the essential elements needed by a multi-ethnic population with overweight and obesity remains unclear. Purpose: To explore the perceptions of an Asian multi-ethnic population with overweight and obesity on the essential elements of weight loss apps. Twenty two participants were purposively sampled from a specialist weight management clinic in Singapore from 13 April to 30 April 2021. Recorded interviews were conducted using face-to-face and videoconferencing modalities. Data saturation was reached at the 18th participant. Data analysis was performed using inductive content analysis with constant comparison between and within transcripts. Findings: Three themes and eight subthemes on the essential app components emerged—(a) comprehensive and flexible calorie counters; (b) holistic, gradual and individualized behavior change recommendations tailored for people with overweight and obesity, and (c) just-in-time reminders of future consequences. There was a need to incorporate flexible options for food logging; break down general recommendations into small steps towards sustainable changes; tailor app contents for people with overweight and obesity; and evoke one’s considerations of future consequences. Future weight loss apps should be designed to meet the needs of those with overweight and obesity, the very population that needs assistance with weight loss. Future apps could consider leveraging the capacity of artificial intelligence to provide personalized weight management in terms of sustaining self-regulation behaviors, optimizing goal-setting and providing personalized and timely recommendations for weight loss. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2023.

A Novel Therapeutic Formulation for the Improved Treatment of Indian Red Scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) Venom-Induced Toxicity-Tested in Caenorhabditis elegans and Rodent Models,"Das, B.; Madhubala, D.; Mahanta, S.; Patra, A.; Puzari, U.; Khan, M.R.; Mukherjee, A.K.","Indian Red Scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) stings are a neglected public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries, including India. The drawbacks of conventional therapies using commercial anti-scorpion antivenom (ASA) and α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists (AAA) have prompted us to search for an adequate formulation to improve treatment against M. tamulus stings. Novel therapeutic drug formulations (TDF) of low doses of commercial ASA, AAA, and ascorbic acid have remarkably improved in neutralising the in vivo toxic effects of M. tamulus venom (MTV) tested in Caenorhabditis elegans and Wistar strain albino rats in vivo models. The neutralisation of MTV-induced production of free radicals, alteration of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and upregulated expression of genes involved in apoptosis, detoxification, and stress response in C. elegans by TDF surpassed the same effect shown by individual components of the TDF. Further, TDF efficiently neutralized the MTV-induced increase in blood glucose level within 30 to 60 min post-treatment, organ tissue damage, necrosis, and pulmonary oedema in Wistar rats, indicating its clinical application for effecting treating M. tamulus envenomation. This study demonstrates for the first time that C. elegans can be a model organism for screening the neutralization potency of the drug molecules against a neurotoxic scorpion venom. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Toxins ,15,8,,,10.3390/toxins15080504,,#5250,Das 2023,,,0
"A functional analysis of personal autonomy: How restricting ‘what’, ‘when’ and ‘how’ affects experienced agency and goal motivation","Zhang, C.; Sankaran, S.; Aarts, H.","Personal autonomy is central to people's experiences of agency and abilities to actively take part in society. To address the challenges of supporting autonomy, we propose a functional model of autonomy, according to which the experience of agency is a function of the opportunity to determine what to do, when to act and how to act in goal-pursuit. We tested the model in three experiments where the three goal-pursuit components could be constrained by another person or an artificial intelligence (AI) agent. Results showed that removing any of the three components from one's own decisions reduced experienced agency (Study 1a and 1b) and lowered motivation to pursue goals in organisational contexts (Study 2). In comparison to the strong and robust main effects, interactions between the components and the effects of the source of restriction (human vs. AI) were negligible. Implications for personal autonomy, algorithmic decision-making and behaviour change interventions are discussed. © 2022 The Authors.

An Integrated Digital Health Care Platform for Diabetes Management With AI-Based Dietary Management: 48-Week Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial,"Lee, Y.-B.; Kim, G.; Jun, J.E.; Park, H.; Lee, W.J.; Hwang, Y.-C.; Kim, J.H.","OBJECTIVE We investigated the efficacy of an integrated digital health care platform with artificial intelligence (AI)–based dietary management in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 48-week, open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, overweight or obese adults with T2D were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: group A received routine diabetes care; group B used the digital integrated health care platform by themselves; and group C used the platform with feedback from medical staff and intermittently applied personal continuous glucose monitoring. The primary end point was the difference of change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks between groups A and B, while secondary end points included changes in HbA1c from baseline to 48 weeks and changes in body weight during follow-up. RESULTS A total of 294 participants were randomly assigned to group A (n = 99), B (n = 97), or C (n = 98). The decreases in HbA1c from baseline to 24 and 48 weeks in group B (20.32 ± 0.58% to 24 weeks and 20.28 ± 0.56% to 48 weeks) and group C (20.49 ± 0.57% to 24 weeks and 20.44 ± 0.62% to 48 weeks) were significantly larger than those in group A (20.06 ± 0.61% to 24 weeks and 0.07 ± 0.78% to 48 weeks). Groups B and C exhibited greater weight loss than group A from baseline to 24 weeks, and group C demonstrated more weight loss than group A from baseline to week 48.

Evaluation of the Current State of Chatbots for Digital Health: Scoping Review,"Xue, J.; Zhang, B.; Zhao, Y.; Zhang, Q.; Zheng, C.; Jiang, J.; Li, H.; Liu, N.; Li, Z.; Fu, W.; Peng, Y.; Logan, J.; Zhang, J.; Xiang, X.","Background: Chatbots have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, enabling natural language conversations with users through various modes of communication. Chatbots have the potential to play a significant role in promoting health and well-being. As the number of studies and available products related to chatbots continues to rise, there is a critical need to assess product features to enhance the design of chatbots that effectively promote health and behavioral change. Objective: This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state of health-related chatbots, including the chatbots' characteristics and features, user backgrounds, communication models, relational building capacity, personalization, interaction, responses to suicidal thoughts, and users' in-app experiences during chatbot use. Through this analysis, we seek to identify gaps in the current research, guide future directions, and enhance the design of health-focused chatbots. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology by Arksey and O'Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist, this study used a two-pronged approach to identify relevant chatbots: (1) searching the iOS and Android App Stores and (2) reviewing scientific literature through a search strategy designed by a librarian. Overall, 36 chatbots were selected based on predefined criteria from both sources. These chatbots were systematically evaluated using a comprehensive framework developed for this study, including chatbot characteristics, user backgrounds, building relational capacity, personalization, interaction models, responses to critical situations, and user experiences. Ten coauthors were responsible for downloading and testing the chatbots, coding their features, and evaluating their performance in simulated conversations. The testing of all chatbot apps was limited to their free-to-use features. Results: This review provides an overview of the diversity of health-related chatbots, encompassing categories such as mental health support, physical activity promotion, and behavior change interventions. Chatbots use text, animations, speech, images, and emojis for communication. The findings highlight variations in conversational capabilities, including empathy, humor, and personalization. Notably, concerns regarding safety, particularly in addressing suicidal thoughts, were evident. Approximately 44% (16/36) of the chatbots effectively addressed suicidal thoughts. User experiences and behavioral outcomes demonstrated the potential of chatbots in health interventions, but evidence remains limited. Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significance of chatbots in health-related applications and offers insights into their features, functionalities, and user experiences. This study contributes to advancing the understanding of chatbots' role in digital health interventions, thus paving the way for more effective and user-centric health promotion strategies. This study informs future research directions, emphasizing the need for rigorous randomized control trials, standardized evaluation metrics, and user-centered design to unlock the full potential of chatbots in enhancing health and well-being. Future research should focus on addressing limitations, exploring real-world user experiences, and implementing robust data security and privacy measures. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Achieving trust in health-behavior-change artificial intelligence apps (HBC-AIApp) development: A multi-perspective guide,"Levy, M.; Pauzner, M.; Rosenblum, S.; Peleg, M.","Objective: Trust determines the success of Health-Behavior-Change Artificial Intelligence Apps (HBC-AIApp). Developers of such apps need theory-based practical methods that can guide them in achieving such trust. Our study aimed to develop a comprehensive conceptual model and development process that can guide developers how to build HBC-AIApp in order to support trust creation among the app's users. Methods: We apply a multi-disciplinary approach where medical informatics, human-centered design, and holistic health methods are integrated to address the trust challenge in HBC-AIApps. The integration extends a conceptual model of trust in AI developed by Jermutus et al., whose properties guide the extension of the IDEAS (integrate, design, assess, and share) HBC-App development process. Results: The HBC-AIApp framework consists of three main blocks: (1) system development methods that study the users' complex reality, hence, their perceptions, needs, goals and environment; (2) mediators and other stakeholders who are important for developing and operating the HBC-AIApp, boundary objects that examine users' activities via the HBC-AIApp; and (3) the HBC-AIApp's structural components, AI logic, and physical implementation. These blocks come together to provide the extended conceptual model of trust in HBC-AIApps and the extended IDEAS process. Discussion: The developed HBC-AIApp framework drew from our own experience in developing trust in HBC-AIApp. Further research will focus on studying the application of the proposed comprehensive HBC-AIApp development framework and whether applying it supports trust creation in such apps. © 2023",2023,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,143,,,,10.1016/j.jbi.2023.104414,,#5255,Levy 2023,,,0
Can Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?,"Ziems, C.; Held, W.; Shaikh, O.; Chen, J.; Zhang, Z.; Yang, D.","Large language models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2023,,Computational Linguistics,50,1,237-291,,10.1162/coli_a_00502,,#5256,Ziems 2023,,,0
The exciting potential for ChatGPT in obstetrics and gynecology,"Grünebaum, A.; Chervenak, J.; Pollet, S.L.; Katz, A.; Chervenak, F.A.","Natural language processing—the branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human language—has advanced markedly in recent years with the introduction of sophisticated deep-learning models. Improved performance in natural language processing tasks, such as text and speech processing, have fueled impressive demonstrations of these models’ capabilities. Perhaps no demonstration has been more impactful to date than the introduction of the publicly available online chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI, which is based on a natural language processing model known as a Generative Pretrained Transformer. Through a series of questions posed by the authors about obstetrics and gynecology to ChatGPT as prompts, we evaluated the model's ability to handle clinical-related queries. Its answers demonstrated that in its current form, ChatGPT can be valuable for users who want preliminary information about virtually any topic in the field. Because its educational role is still being defined, we must recognize its limitations. Although answers were generally eloquent, informed, and lacked a significant degree of mistakes or misinformation, we also observed evidence of its weaknesses. A significant drawback is that the data on which the model has been trained are apparently not readily updated. The specific model that was assessed here, seems to not reliably (if at all) source data from after 2021. Users of ChatGPT who expect data to be more up to date need to be aware of this drawback. An inability to cite sources or to truly understand what the user is asking suggests that it has the capability to mislead. Responsible use of models like ChatGPT will be important for ensuring that they work to help but not harm users seeking information on obstetrics and gynecology. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023,,American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,228,6,696-705,,10.1016/j.ajog.2023.03.009,,#5258,Grünebaum 2023,,,0

Inducing AI-powered chatbot use for customer purchase: the role of information value and innovative technology,"Le, X.C.","Purpose: This study aims to understand a customer-purchase mechanism in the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot context based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and technology acceptance model (TAM). The first objective is to examine how to boost chatbot adoption. The second objective is to investigate the role of information characteristics, technology-related characteristics and attitude toward AI in purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from a sample of 492 users in Vietnam, who are potential customers of chatbots for purchase. Structural equation modeling was applied for data analysis. Findings: Results illustrate that chatbot adoption is significantly influenced by information credibility, technology-related factors (i.e. interactivity, relative advantage and perceived intelligence), attitude toward AI and perceived usefulness. Moreover, information quality and persuasiveness motivate information credibility. Information credibility and attitude toward AI are the essential motivations for perceived usefulness. Finally, chatbot adoption and information credibility determine purchase intention. Practical implications: The results are insightful for practitioners to envisage the importance of chatbot use for customer purchase in the AI scenario. Additionally, this research offers a framework to practitioners for shaping customer engagement in chatbots. Originality/value: The value of this work lies in the incorporation of technology-related characteristics into the two well-established theories, the ELM and TAM, to identify the importance of AI and its applications (i.e. chatbots) for purchase and to understand the formation of perceived usefulness and chatbot use through information credibility and attitude toward AI. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,,Journal of Systems and Information Technology,25,2,219-241,,10.1108/JSIT-09-2021-0206,,#5260,Le 2023,,,0
Conversational Agents and Avatars for Cardiometabolic Risk Factors and Lifestyle-Related Behaviors: Scoping Review,"Lyzwinski, L.N.; Elgendi, M.; Menon, C.","Background: In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of conversational agents for lifestyle medicine, in particular for weight-related behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors. Little is known about the effectiveness and acceptability of and engagement with conversational and virtual agents as well as the applicability of these agents for metabolic syndrome risk factors such as an unhealthy dietary intake, physical inactivity, diabetes, and hypertension. Objective: This review aimed to get a greater understanding of the virtual agents that have been developed for cardiometabolic risk factors and to review their effectiveness. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted to review conversational agents for cardiometabolic risk factors, including chatbots and embodied avatars. Results: A total of 50 studies were identified. Overall, chatbots and avatars appear to have the potential to improve weight-related behaviors such as dietary intake and physical activity. There were limited studies on hypertension and diabetes. Patients seemed interested in using chatbots and avatars for modifying cardiometabolic risk factors, and adherence was acceptable across the studies, except for studies of virtual agents for diabetes. However, there is a need for randomized controlled trials to confirm this finding.

An Interactive Way to Understand Dementia: Multimodal Experiential Learning Approach in Gerontology Education,"Çetingök, S.; Irmak, H.S.; Gültekin, T.","Objective: In parallel with the aging population, it will be necessary to provide health care to an increasing number of dementia patients in the coming years. It is critical to develop a gerontology education perspective and change it in accordance with the possibilities of the age. The simulation-based learning method provides an opportunity for experiential learning in education. There is quite a few data on how dementia simulation education improves attitudes toward dementia. We examined how a simulation education program changed students’ attitudes toward communication, empathy, and dementia with individuals with dementia. Methods: This quantitative study investigated undergraduate students’ change in awareness of dementia before and after participating in the educational intervention. This study employed a one-group repeated-measures design. A non-virtual, applied dementia simulation program consisting of eight stations was studied with gerontology third and fourth years 116 students. The data were collected by applying the Personal Information form, Dementia Attitude scale (DAS), Empathy Quotient scale (EQS), and The Evaluation Scale of Education Program (ESEP). Results: DAS and EQS scores were significantly higher after the theorical (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000) and practical education (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000) than before the theorical (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000) and practical education. DAS, EQS, and ESEP scores significantly higher after practical education than after the theorical one (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000; pESEP=0.000). Conclusion: Results; points out that dementia simulation helps students understand the experiences of people living with dementia, develop empathetic attitudes, and that dementia simulation education complements and improves traditional teaching methods.

A Video Is Worth 4096 Tokens: Verbalize Videos To Understand Them In Zero Shot,"Bhattacharyya, A.; Singla, Y.K.; Krishnamurthy, B.; Shah, R.R.; Chen, C.","Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. There is a dearth of large annotated training datasets in the multimedia domain hindering the development of supervised learning models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. On the other hand, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question-answering, and topic classification. To leverage such advanced techniques to bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing long videos to generate their descriptions in natural language, followed by performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on fifteen video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised baselines for video understanding. Furthermore, to alleviate a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science on persuasion strategy identification. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2023,,"EMNLP 2023 - 2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Proceedings",,,9822-9839,,10.18653/v1/2023.emnlp-main.608,,#5266,Bhattacharyya 2023,,,0

In a pipeline, the identification and analysis of the arguments and their components (i.e. premises and claims) in texts and the prediction of their relations (i.e. attack and support) are then handled by argument-based reasoning frameworks so that, for example, fallacies and inconsistencies can be automatically identified. Recently, the field of argument mining has tackled new challenges, namely the evaluation of argument quality (e.g. strength, persuasiveness), natural language argument summarisation and retrieval, and natural language argument generation. In this paper, I discuss my main contributions in this area as well as some lines of future research. Copyright © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Long-Horizon Dialogue Understanding for Role Identification in the Game of Avalon with Large Language Models,"Stepputtis, S.; Campbell, J.; Xie, Y.; Qi, Z.; Zhang, W.S.; Wang, R.; Rangreji, S.; Lewis, C.M.; Sycara, K.P.","Deception and persuasion play a critical role in long-horizon dialogues between multiple parties, especially when the interests, goals, and motivations of the participants are not aligned. Such complex tasks pose challenges for current Large Language Models (LLM) as deception and persuasion can easily mislead them, especially in long-horizon multi-party dialogues. To this end, we explore the game of Avalon: The Resistance, a social deduction game in which players must determine each other's hidden identities to complete their team's objective. We introduce an online testbed and a dataset containing 20 carefully collected and labeled games among human players that exhibit long-horizon deception in a cooperative-competitive setting. We discuss the capabilities of LLMs to utilize deceptive long-horizon conversations between six human players to determine each player's goal and motivation. Particularly, we discuss the multimodal integration of the chat between the players and the game's state that grounds the conversation, providing further insights into the true player identities. We find that even current state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach human performance, making our dataset a compelling benchmark to investigate the decision-making and language-processing capabilities of LLMs. Our dataset and online testbed can be found at our project website: https://sstepput.github.io/Avalon-NLU/. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2023,,Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023,,,11193-11208,,10.18653/v1/2023.findings-emnlp.748,,#5270,Stepputtis 2023,,,0
Conversational AI and Vaccine Communication: Systematic Review of the Evidence,"Passanante, A.; Pertwee, E.; Lin, L.; Lee, K.Y.; Wu, J.T.; Larson, H.J.","Background: Since the mid-2010s, use of conversational artificial intelligence (AI; chatbots) in health care has expanded significantly, especially in the context of increased burdens on health systems and restrictions on in-person consultations with health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. One emerging use for conversational AI is to capture evolving questions and communicate information about vaccines and vaccination. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to examine documented uses and evidence on the effectiveness of conversational AI for vaccine communication. Methods: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Embase, Epistemonikos, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, Academic Search Complete, and the University of London library database were searched for papers on the use of conversational AI for vaccine communication. The inclusion criteria were studies that included (1) documented instances of conversational AI being used for the purpose of vaccine communication and (2) evaluation data on the impact and effectiveness of the intervention. Results: After duplicates were removed, the review identified 496 unique records, which were then screened by title and abstract, of which 38 were identified for full-text review. Seven fit the inclusion criteria and were assessed and summarized in the findings of this review. Overall, vaccine chatbots deployed to date have been relatively simple in their design and have mainly been used to provide factual information to users in response to their questions about vaccines. Additionally, chatbots have been used for vaccination scheduling, appointment reminders, debunking misinformation, and, in some cases, for vaccine counseling and persuasion. Available evidence suggests that chatbots can have a positive effect on vaccine attitudes; however, studies were typically exploratory in nature, and some lacked a control group or had very small sample sizes. Conclusions: The review found evidence of potential benefits from conversational AI for vaccine communication. Factors that may contribute to the effectiveness of vaccine chatbots include their ability to provide credible and personalized information in real time, the familiarity and accessibility of the chatbot platform, and the extent to which interactions with the chatbot feel “natural” to users. However, evaluations have focused on the short-term, direct effects of chatbots on their users. The potential longer-term and societal impacts of conversational AI have yet to be analyzed. In addition, existing studies do not adequately address how ethics apply in the field of conversational AI around vaccines. In a context where further digitalization of vaccine communication can be anticipated, additional high-quality research will be required across all these areas. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

On Automation of Flight Training of AI Pilots: A Formal Language to Particularize Flight Instruction Scenarios,"Regli, C.; Annighoefer, B.","Considering development assurance, predictability, explainability and robustness, the lack of trustworthiness has been identified as the key challenge when it comes to the certification of adaptive flight automation systems. Such systems change their characteristics in response to changes in the mission, environment, threats, or failures, which disallows certification according to the currently applicable set of regulations that stipulate a strictly deterministic behaviour. Automation systems are supposed to maintain the status that has been certified. They are not allowed to evolve, to learn from experience, because the risks associated with a changing behaviour are unforeseeable.Rule-based, certifiable software is developed according to well-established processes and software assurance. A thorough requirements engineering results in a set of software requirements, which will be, after deployment, traced back and verified according to the specification. Learning-based systems, in contrast, learn from training data. Herewith, the challenge shifts to the production of such training data and the subsequent training. On the one hand, training data has to meet the required level of integrity. Incomplete, wrong, ambiguous, noised, or biased training data may lead to undesired behaviour. On the other hand, training data should be available in sufficient quantity for training, validation, and testing of the system in question.An anthropomorphic approach could significantly contribute to the production of training data and the training itself, given the availability - and the validity - of all the training exercises and check standards for manned aviation. Once in a machine-interpretable form, these well-established and proven exercises could be modified automatically with adaptions of the environmental conditions (weather, other traffic,...), with unexpected occurrences of system failures, or could be re-created from a base set of building blocks. The training of a future adaptive flight automation system could profit from a great availability, integrity, and diversity of data. During the training, an electronic flight instructor could demonstrate the accomplishment of such training scenarios, allowing the system to learn from example. Then, an electronic flight examiner could check whether a flight automation system satisfactorily completes the given exercise, based on check standards from manned aviation. Even after deployment, the monitoring could continue, flagging any decrease in the desired performance and disclosing adverse learning effects.Training syllabi and simulator session rundowns delineate what the assigned flight instructor is supposed to do during the training. Many syllabi are available for basic flight training, type rating training, line-oriented flight training, low-visibility training, upset prevention and recovery training, training for airports with special approach procedures and much more. Check standards are formulated, framing the allowable tolerances during a flight check.This paper copes with the challenge of compiling these syllabi and standards into an unambiguous form that can be used to automate flight training. It first introduces a classification scheme for flight training exercises, dividing them into the classes of deterministic and non-deterministic exercises, supporting the different training phases. Secondly, the general flying tasks of a pilot are categorized into prime flying tasks, indivisible tasks that are combinable in order to meet the standards in all phases of an exercise. Finally, based on these two ingredients, a formal language is proposed, interpretable by a computer system, by an electronic flight instructor / flight examiner, to particularize flight training scenarios - with a concrete example of a basic training exercise, the standard traffic pattern. This will eventually support the establishment of such an anthropomorphic approach, allowing us to train and check future adaptive flight automation systems in a traceable, proven, and extensible framework nowadays already in use for human pilots. Until then, the proposed automated flight training can be validated and refined with human pilot aspirants and human flight instructors.  © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,AIAA/IEEE Digital Avionics Systems Conference - Proceedings,,,,,10.1109/DASC58513.2023.10311223,,#5273,Regli 2023,,,0

Towards a New Approach to Increasing the Persuasion of Product Marketing: An Experimental Study,"Anggia, P.; Sumi, K.","Modern marketing strategies that leverage technology to of-fer significant value for the client have replaced conventional selling techniques in recent years. A conversational agent or dialogue system presents an interactive computing product as a means of influencing people’s opinions. However, this expanding topic still had limits in the earlier study. To advance this field, the current experimental study incorporates new elements that are re-quired to enhance the ability to persuade and build a compelling case for product advertising. Research in the past has shown that emotional branding is essential to strengthen the customer’s engagement. Therefore, in this study, we created six contents, conducted an experiment with Japanese participants, and analyzed how to persuade them with emotional and cultural content using a sinking boat joke. A sinking boat joke is a joke about convincing people to jump into the water when a boat is ready to sink, which incorporates a cultural context. The experiment was conducted by recruiting Japanese students at a Japanese university. Contents were presented in a counterbalanced way. The goal is to ascertain which emotion works best for advertising, to investigate cultural differences, and to analyze the content effectiveness that successfully persuades the Japanese participants. © 2022 The Author.",2023,,"Journal of Robotics, Networking and Artificial Life",10,3,226-230,,10.57417/jrnal.10.3_226,,#5277,Anggia 2023,,,0

"Scope, Characteristics, Behavior Change Techniques, and Quality of Conversational Agents for Mental Health and Well-Being: Systematic Assessment of Apps","Lin, X.; Martinengo, L.; Jabir, A.I.; Ho, A.H.Y.; Car, J.; Atun, R.; Car, L.T.","Background: Mental disorders cause substantial health-related burden worldwide. Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated costs. Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being. There is a need to discern the active components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately improve users’ mental health. Objective: This study systematically identified mental health conversational agents (CAs) currently available in app stores and assessed the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used. We further described their main features, technical aspects, and quality in terms of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information using the Mobile Application Rating Scale. Methods: The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and an evaluation following predefined criteria. We conducted a systematic app search of Apple’s App Store and Google Play using 42matters. Apps with CAs in English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. The BCT taxonomy v1, a comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change components in CAs. Results: We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. Most CAs had <1000 user ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). All CAs addressed >1 mental disorder. Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Half (9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). CAs used 48 different BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. The most common BCTs were 3.3 “Social support (emotional),” 4.1 “Instructions for how to perform a behavior,” 11.2 “Reduce negative emotions,” and 6.1 “Demonstration of the behavior.” One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not include core CBT concepts. Conclusions: Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. The most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental disorders with few therapeutic elements. CA developers should consider the quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management when designing mental health CAs. Future research should assess the role of artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital mental health interventions. © Xiaowen Lin, Laura Martinengo, Ahmad Ishqi Jabir, Andy Hau Yan Ho, Josip Car, Rifat Atun, Lorainne Tudor Car.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,,,,10.2196/45984,,#5282,Lin 2023,,,0

Persuasion Strategies in Advertisements,"Kumar, Y.; Jha, R.; Gupta, A.; Aggarwal, M.; Garg, A.; Malyan, T.; Bhardwaj, A.; Shah, R.R.; Krishnamurthy, B.; Chen, C.","Modeling what makes an advertisement persuasive, i.e., eliciting the desired response from consumer, is critical to the study of propaganda, social psychology, and marketing. Despite its importance, computational modeling of persuasion in computer vision is still in its infancy, primarily due to the lack of benchmark datasets that can provide persuasion-strategy labels associated with ads. Motivated by persuasion literature in social psychology and marketing, we introduce an extensive vocabulary of persuasion strategies and build the first ad image corpus annotated with persuasion strategies. We then formulate the task of persuasion strategy prediction with multi-modal learning, where we design a multi-task attention fusion model that can leverage other ad-understanding tasks to predict persuasion strategies. The dataset also provides image segmentation masks, which labels persuasion strategies in the corresponding ad images on the test split.

Modeling Mixed Traffic Flow with Connected Autonomous Vehicles and Human-Driven Vehicles in Off-Ramp Diverging Areas,"Chen, X.; Wu, Z.; Liang, Y.","This paper focuses on modeling mixed traffic flow that comprises human-driven vehicles (HV), adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles, and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles in the off-ramp diverging area. The car-following behaviors of HVs, ACC vehicles, and CACC vehicles are modeled using an intelligent driver model (IDM), ACC car-following model, and CACC car-following model, respectively. The lane-changing behaviors of different types of vehicles in off-ramp diverging areas are modeled using the anticipatory lane change (ALC) model and the mandatory lane change (MLC) model. These models are important for describing the interaction among different types of vehicles in mixed traffic. The safety and efficiency of mixed traffic flow are analyzed by integrating the developed car-following models and lane-changing models in numerical simulation. A one-way, two-lane scenario is established for the simulation. The results reveal that when the proportion of CACC vehicles is about 0.6, the safety and general operating efficiency of mixed traffic flow in the off-ramp area deteriorate significantly. Increasing the conservative MLC zone length can improve the average speed of traffic flow. Guiding drivers in changing lanes is one way to improve the efficiency of traffic flow. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Sustainability (Switzerland),15,7,,,10.3390/su15075651,,#5285,Chen 2023,,,0
Hidden behavioral fingerprints in epilepsy,"Gschwind, T.; Zeine, A.; Raikov, I.; Markowitz, J.E.; Gillis, W.F.; Felong, S.; Isom, L.L.; Datta, S.R.; Soltesz, I.","Epilepsy is a major disorder affecting millions of people. Although modern electrophysiological and imaging approaches provide high-resolution access to the multi-scale brain circuit malfunctions in epilepsy, our understanding of how behavior changes with epilepsy has remained rudimentary. As a result, screening for new therapies for children and adults with devastating epilepsies still relies on the inherently subjective, semi-quantitative assessment of a handful of pre-selected behavioral signs of epilepsy in animal models. Here, we use machine learning-assisted 3D video analysis to reveal hidden behavioral phenotypes in mice with acquired and genetic epilepsies and track their alterations during post-insult epileptogenesis and in response to anti-epileptic drugs.

Computational decision-support tools for urban design to improve resilience against COVID-19 and other infectious diseases: A systematic review,"Yang, L.; Iwami, M.; Chen, Y.; Wu, M.; van Dam, K.H.","The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for decision-support tools to help cities become more resilient to infectious diseases. Through urban design and planning, non-pharmaceutical interventions can be enabled, impelling behaviour change and facilitating the construction of lower risk buildings and public spaces. Computational tools, including computer simulation, statistical models, and artificial intelligence, have been used to support responses to the current pandemic as well as to the spread of previous infectious diseases. Our multidisciplinary research group systematically reviewed state-of-the-art literature to propose a toolkit that employs computational modelling for various interventions and urban design processes. We selected 109 out of 8,737 studies retrieved from databases and analysed them based on the pathogen type, transmission mode and phase, design intervention and process, as well as modelling methodology (method, goal, motivation, focus, and indication to urban design). We also explored the relationship between infectious disease and urban design, as well as computational modelling support, including specific models and parameters. The proposed toolkit will help designers, planners, and computer modellers to select relevant approaches for evaluating design decisions depending on the target disease, geographic context, design stages, and spatial and temporal scales. The findings herein can be regarded as stand-alone tools, particularly for fighting against COVID-19, or be incorporated into broader frameworks to help cities become more resilient to future disasters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Progress in Planning,168,,,,10.1016/j.progress.2022.100657,,#5291,Yang 2023,,,0

Persuasive communication systems: a machine learning approach to predict the effect of linguistic styles and persuasion techniques,"Braca, A.; Dondio, P.","Purpose: Prediction is a critical task in targeted online advertising, where predictions better than random guessing can translate to real economic return. This study aims to use machine learning (ML) methods to identify individuals who respond well to certain linguistic styles/persuasion techniques based on Aristotle’s means of persuasion, rhetorical devices, cognitive theories and Cialdini’s principles, given their psychometric profile. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,022 individuals took part in the survey; participants were asked to fill out the ten item personality measure questionnaire to capture personality traits and the dysfunctional attitude scale (DAS) to measure dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive vulnerabilities. ML classification models using participant profiling information as input were developed to predict the extent to which an individual was influenced by statements that contained different linguistic styles/persuasion techniques. Several ML algorithms were used including support vector machine, LightGBM and Auto-Sklearn to predict the effect of each technique given each individual’s profile (personality, belief system and demographic data). Findings: The findings highlight the importance of incorporating emotion-based variables as model input in predicting the influence of textual statements with embedded persuasion techniques. Across all investigated models, the influence effect could be predicted with an accuracy ranging 53%–70%, indicating the importance of testing multiple ML algorithms in the development of a persuasive communication (PC) system. The classification ability of models was highest when predicting the response to statements using rhetorical devices and flattery persuasion techniques. Contrastingly, techniques such as authority or social proof were less predictable. Adding DAS scale features improved model performance, suggesting they may be important in modelling persuasion. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the survey was limited to English-speaking countries and largely Western society values. More work is needed to ascertain the efficacy of models for other populations, cultures and languages. Most PC efforts are targeted at groups such as users, clients, shoppers and voters with this study in the communication context of education – further research is required to explore the capability of predictive ML models in other contexts. Finally, long self-reported psychological questionnaires may not be suitable for real-world deployment and could be subject to bias, thus a simpler method needs to be devised to gather user profile data such as using a subset of the most predictive features. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that leveraging richer profiling data in conjunction with ML approaches may assist in the development of enhanced persuasive systems. There are many applications such as online apps, digital advertising, recommendation systems, chatbots and e-commerce platforms which can benefit from integrating persuasion communication systems that tailor messaging to the individual – potentially translating into higher economic returns. Originality/value: This study integrates sets of features that have heretofore not been used together in developing ML-based predictive models of PC. DAS scale data, which relate to dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive vulnerabilities, were assessed for their importance in identifying effective persuasion techniques. Additionally, the work compares a range of persuasion techniques that thus far have only been studied separately. This study also demonstrates the application of various ML methods in predicting the influence of linguistic styles/persuasion techniques within textual statements and show that a robust methodology comparing a range of ML algorithms is important in the discovery of a performant model. © 2023, Annye Braca and Pierpaolo Dondio.",2023,,Journal of Systems and Information Technology,25,2,160-191,,10.1108/JSIT-07-2022-0166,,#5293,Braca 2023,,,0

When Artificial Intelligence Voices Human Concerns: The Paradoxical Effects of AI Voice on Climate Risk Perception and Pro-Environmental Behavioral Intention,"Ni, B.; Wu, F.; Huang, Q.","Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled text-to-speech transformation has been widely employed to deliver online information in various fields. However, few studies have investigated the effect of the AI voice in environmental risk communication, especially in the field of climate change, an issue that poses a severe threat to global public health. To address this gap, the current study examines how the AI voice impacts the persuasive outcome of climate-related information and the potential mechanism that underlies this process. Based on the social and affect heuristics of voice, we propose a serial mediation model to test the effect of climate-related information delivered by different voice types (AI voice vs. human voice) in eliciting risk perception and motivating pro-environmental behavioral intention. Through an online auditory experiment (N = 397), we found the following. First, the AI voice was as effective as the human voice in eliciting risk perception and motivating pro-environmental behavioral intention. Second, compared with human voice, the AI voice yielded a listener’s lower level of perceived identity oneness with the speaker, which decreased risk perception and subsequently inhibited pro-environmental behavioral intention. Third, compared with human voice, the AI voice produced a higher level of auditory fear, which increased risk perception and thereby led to stronger pro-environmental behavioral intention. The paradoxical role of the AI voice and its wise use in environmental risk communication for promoting global public health are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,20,4,,,10.3390/ijerph20043772,,#5295,Ni 2023,,,0
Tracing the legitimacy of Artificial Intelligence: A longitudinal analysis of media discourse,"Korneeva, E.; Salge, T.O.; Teubner, T.; Antons, D.","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most relevant technologies of our time. During the last decade, AI has made major technological breakthroughs most recently in the space of generative AI. This development is enabled by an increase in computing power, a decrease in its price, and the emergence of ubiquitous computing, resulting in vast amounts of storable and processable data. However, the diffusion of AI depends on its legitimacy in society, whereby legitimacy is understood as the congruence between organizational activities and their cultural environment. This study aims at understanding the process whereby AI is being (de)legitimated across key industries and over time. To capture and trace the process of legitimation, we rely on media coverage as a form of societal discourse reflecting the legitimation process of AI. We find that the legitimation process gathers momentum in the mid-2010s and the legitimacy of AI increases over time. Furthermore, we identify four types of legitimacy discourse, which integrate sentiment, specific media frames, and appeals of persuasion. Uncovering the four types of legitimacy discourse, we aim at supporting organizations seeking to understand the legitimacy of specific AI applications and how these legitimacy judgments can shift. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.",2023,,Technological Forecasting and Social Change,192,,,,10.1016/j.techfore.2023.122467,,#5296,Korneeva 2023,,,0
Werewolf Among Us: Multimodal Resources for Modeling Persuasion Behaviors in Social Deduction Games,"Lai, B.; Zhang, H.; Liu, M.; Pariani, A.; Ryan, F.; Jia, W.; Hayati, S.A.; Rehg, J.M.; Yang, D.","Persuasion modeling is a key building block for conversational agents. Existing works in this direction are limited to analyzing textual dialogue corpora. We argue that visual signals also play an important role in understanding human persuasive behaviors.

What to Discuss?—A Blueprint Topic Model for Health Coaching Dialogues With Conversational Agents,"Beinema, T.; op den Akker, H.; Hermens, H.J.; van Velsen, L.","Conversational agents (CAs) are often included as virtual coaches in eHealth applications. Tailoring conversations with these coaches to the individual user can increase the effectiveness of the coaching. An improvement for this tailoring process could be to (automatically) tailor the conversation at the topic level. In this article, we describe the design and evaluation of a blueprint topic model for use in the implementation of such topic selection. First, we constructed a topic model by extracting actions from the literature that a CA as coach could perform. We divided these actions in groups and labeled them with topics. We included literature from the behavioral psychology, relational agents and persuasive technology domains. Second, we evaluated this topic model through an online closed card sort study with health coaching experts. The constructed topic model contains 30 topics and 115 actions. Overall, the sorting of actions into topics was validated by the 11 experts participating in the card sort. Cards with actions that were sorted incorrectly mostly missed an immediacy indicator in their description (e.g., the difference between “you could plan regular walks” as opposed to “let’s plan a walk”) and/or were based on behavior change techniques that were difficult to translate to a conversation. The blueprint topic model presented in this article is an important step towards more intelligent virtual coaches. Future research should focus on the implementation of automatic topic selection. Furthermore, tailoring of coaching dialogues with CAs in multiple steps could be further investigated, for example, from the technical or user interaction perspective. © 2022 The Author(s).

Being an Emotionally Intelligent Leader through the Nine-Layer Model of Emotional Intelligence—The Supporting Role of New Technologies,"Drigas, A.; Papoutsi, C.; Skianis, C.","Several years ago, a characteristic of leadership was the intelligence index, but in recent years this has changed, and emotional intelligence is considered an important parameter for a leader. A leader who shows a high index of emotional intelligence can activate his/her human potential and subsequently others. There is a large body of literature on “what” great leaders should do, but more emphasis needs to be placed on “how” to develop such leaders by focusing on detailed individual behavior change and self-development. The current article aims to investigate the concept of emotional intelligence and describe the levels of the emotional intelligence pyramid model and how these are reflected in the role of leadership. The theoretical model is complemented by a set of metacognitive and metaemotional strategies while emphasizing the role of technologies to provide fertile ground for the implementation of emotional intelligence skills in leadership. The strategies framework provides a training paradigm for implementation in education and working environments. The results of this article provide a new theoretical framework of the emotional skills a leader must possess, and they also provide a useful framework for cultivating them, which will promote long-term human capital development and help everyone achieve educational and professional success. The pyramid model of emotional intelligence and its strategies can have practical applications in any form of leadership, as research has shown a positive correlation between these two concepts. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Sustainability (Switzerland),15,10,,,10.3390/su15108103,,#5302,Drigas 2023,,,0

Prompt-Based Monte-Carlo Tree Search for Goal-oriented Dialogue Policy Planning,"Yu, X.; Chen, M.; Yu, Z.","Planning for goal-oriented dialogue often requires simulating future dialogue interactions and estimating task progress. Many approaches thus consider training neural networks to perform look-ahead search algorithms such as A* search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, this training often requires abundant annotated data, which creates challenges when faced with noisy annotations or low-resource settings. We introduce GDP-ZERO, an approach using Open-Loop MCTS to perform goal-oriented dialogue policy planning without any model training. GDP-ZERO prompts a large language model to act as a policy prior, value function, user simulator, and system model during the tree search.

We study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess truthfulness during a pandemic, targeting statements related to COVID-19, thus addressing (mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal issue and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done. In our experiments, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements, and to provide evidence for the assessments. Besides showing that the crowd is able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we report results on workers’ behavior, agreement among workers, effect of aggregation functions, of scales transformations, and of workers background and bias. We perform a longitudinal study by re-launching the task multiple times with both novice and experienced workers, deriving important insights on how the behavior and quality change over time. Our results show that workers are able to detect and objectively categorize online (mis)information related to COVID-19; both crowdsourced and expert judgments can be transformed and aggregated to improve quality; worker background and other signals (e.g., source of information, behavior) impact the quality of the data. The longitudinal study demonstrates that the time-span has a major effect on the quality of the judgments, for both novice and experienced workers. Finally, we provide an extensive failure analysis of the statements misjudged by the crowd-workers. © 2021, The Author(s).",2023,,Personal and Ubiquitous Computing,27,1,59-89,,10.1007/s00779-021-01604-6,,#5307,Roitero 2023,,,0

Can we serve both God and Money? The role of indirect appeal and its limitation,"Park, S.S.; Kang, J.-S.; Markman, G.D.","Purpose: Harmonizing religion and economic pursuits is treacherous because mixing the two rarely resonate with consumers, often resulting consumers’ greed perceptions. This paper aims to explore the antecedents and consequence of consumers’ greed perceptions in the context of for-profit religious-affiliated companies (FPRCs) and how they can harmonize religious and commercial missions by using different ad types (direct vs indirect appeal). Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted two experiments: Study 1 was an online experiment with participants from the USA collected through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (n = 410) to reveal the overall mechanism. Study 2 was a field experiment (n = 292) to corroborate Study 1’s findings. The authors analyzed the data using a multigroup structural equation model. Findings: First, consumers perceive greed against FPRCs’ dual identities incurred by their commercial activities. Second, when FPRCs obscure their religious identities by using third-party organizations (TPOs) as its promoter (i.e. indirect appeal), consumers’ greed perceptions decline, but this does not increase consumers’ future patronage intentions. Finally, in online and field experiments, consumers enhance their purchase intentions and behavior, respectively, under indirect appeal. Research limitations/implications: First, further investigation of the cognitive dissonance mechanism when consumers face seemingly contradictory identities of organizations is crucial to identify bottlenecks in promoting FPRCs’ commercial offerings. Second, examining boundary conditions of indirect appeal is important to enhance our understanding of FPRCs’ advertising, such as consumers’ awareness of TPOs’ intentionality. Lastly, not every type of indirect appeal brings the same effects. Future studies may explore diverse forms of indirect appeal, such as using artificial intelligence-based algorithms without TPOs. Practical implications: Despite heightened interest in supporting dual missions (i.e. purpose and profit), this study shows why doing well while doing good is inherently challenging in practice creating marketing liability. To deal with this, the present findings suggest that, first, rather than exposing an FPRC’s religious (or communal) identity upfront, providing subtle cues through a TPO of its religious affiliation can be persuasive to win the hearts of target customers. Second, given the short-term effectiveness of indirect appeal, FPRCs need to use both direct and indirect appeal flexibly, as each type of ad delivers a distinctive advantage. Lastly, indirect appeal is particularly effective in offline promotional activities in the context of FPRCs. Originality/value: First, by meshing paradox theory, the authors show that dual identities of FPRCs expose them to a marketing liability that single-mission enterprises rarely face. Second, when FPRCs use indirect appeal, they face a tradeoff between mitigating greed perception and securing future patronage. Third, results from the online experiment and field experiment show when consumers’ intention and actual behavior align. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2023,,European Journal of Marketing,57,7,1912-1938,,10.1108/EJM-03-2022-0234,,#5309,Park 2023,,,0
Multilevel resistance state tuned by change in crystallization mode of superlattice-like Sb/Si3N4 films,"Wu, Y.; Cai, L.; Miao, L.; Wang, Z.; Lu, Y.","Phase change materials (PCMs) have been attracting increasing interest in computer bionics and artificial intelligence neuron systems. However, the influence of interface between Si3N4 and PCMs on phase chang behavior is still unclear. In this paper, phase change performance and crystallization behavior of homogeneous Sb film are adjusted by changing the thickness of the Si3N4 film and the iteration period. Sb film covered by Si3N4 has better thermal stability, better data retention, and higher crystallization rate due to that the stable Si3N4 can reduce the long-range order and inhibit the nano-size growth of Sb crystal grains. The low element diffusion between Sb and Si3N4 is favorable to stabilize the nano-interface and significantly improve the resistance drift. The resistance polymorphism including high, intermediate, and low resistance states can be obtained by annealing at different temperatures. The ability to achieve such a multilevel resistance state is ascribed to the nucleation-dominated crystallization mode. © 2023",2023,,Materials Research Bulletin,161,,,,10.1016/j.materresbull.2023.112152,,#5310,Wu 2023,,,0
Digital technology for person-centered care,"Glare, P.; da Silva, L.L.; Kirisci, L.; Ashton-James, C.","The widespread use of computers, digital cellular phones, and the Internet has the potential to improve health care and make it more person-centered. The goal of digital health is to provide more effective and efficient health care through the use of information and communication technologies. Technology-driven change has impacted less on health care in the past than it has on other industries, but this is changing as obstacles to its uptake are overcome. These include disparities in access and engagement with digital technologies, concerns about privacy and security of sensitive health information, limited evidence for effectiveness and concerns about safety (e.g. using mental health apps) and concerns about robots replacing clinicians. As these obstacles are overcome, digital health may enable care that is more person centered (of, with, for and by the person). This can be achieved through more individualized assessment; enhanced sharing of decision making and collaborative treatment planning; and by supporting health behavior change and greater participation in self-management. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

Risk Assessment: Considerations for Coronal Caries,"Campos, M.S.; Fontana, M.","Caries risk assessment (CRA) is essential to delivering personalized/precision care in caries management. Limited formal evaluation and validation of existing CRA tools affects the ability to accurately predict new lesions. However, this should not prevent clinicians from assessing modifiable risk factors to guide preventive measures and address individual needs to personalize care. Since caries is a multifactorial and dynamic disease process, CRA is complex and impacted by multiple variables throughout the life course, demanding periodic re-assessment. Many factors can influence caries risk at the individual, family, and community level; however, unfortunately, caries experience is still considered one of the greatest indicators of future risk for caries. CRA tools that are validated, inexpensive, and easy to use should be developed and prioritized to help support decision-making to implement evidence based, and minimally invasive caries management strategies for coronal caries lesions in children, adults, and older persons. Efforts into developing CRA tools should include evaluation and reporting of internal and external validation information. In the future, approaches using big data and artificial intelligence may drive risk predictions, and cost-effectiveness analyses may help derive the selection of appropriate risk thresholds for decision-making. Because of the importance of CRA in the treatment planning and decision-making process, challenges for implementation including how to communicate risk to drive behavior change, development of tools that are quick and easy to integrate seamlessly into the busy clinical flow, and reimbursement for the time needed to implement should be considered. © 2023 S.

Decarbonization in waste recycling industry using digitalization to promote net-zero emissions and its implications on sustainability,"Kurniawan, T.A.; Othman, M.H.D.; Liang, X.; Goh, H.H.; Gikas, P.; Kusworo, T.D.; Anouzla, A.; Chew, K.W.","Digitalization and sustainability have been considered as critical elements in tackling a growing problem of solid waste in the framework of circular economy (CE). Although digitalization can enhance time-efficiency and/or cost-efficiency, their end-results do not always lead to sustainability. So far, the literatures still lack of a holistic view in understanding the development trends and key roles of digitalization in waste recycling industry to benefit stakeholders and to protect the environment. To bridge this knowledge gap, this work systematically investigates how leveraging digitalization in waste recycling industry could address these research questions: (1) What are the key problems of solid waste recycling? (2) How the trends of digitalization in waste management could benefit a CE? (3) How digitalization could strengthen waste recycling industry in a post-pandemic era? While digitalization boosts material flows in a CE, it is evident that utilizing digital solutions to strengthen waste recycling business could reinforce a resource-efficient, low-carbon, and a CE. In the Industry 4.0 era, digitalization can add 15% (about USD 15.7 trillion) to global economy by 2030. As digitalization grows, making the waste sector shift to a CE could save between 30% and 35% of municipalities' waste management budget. With digitalization, a cost reduction of 3.6% and a revenue increase of 4.1% are projected annually. This would contribute to USD 493 billion in an increasing revenue yearly in the next decade. As digitalization enables tasks to be completed shortly with less manpower, this could save USD 421 billion annually for the next decade. With respect to environmental impacts, digitalization in the waste sector could reduce global CO2 emissions by 15% by 2030 through technological solutions. Overall, this work suggests that digitalization in the waste sector contributes net-zero emission to a digital economy, while transitioning to a sustainable world as its social impacts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",2023,,Journal of Environmental Management,338,,,,10.1016/j.jenvman.2023.117765,,#5317,Kurniawan 2023,,,0
Conversational Agents for Body Weight Management: Systematic Review,"Noh, E.; Won, J.; Jo, S.; Hahm, D.-H.; Lee, H.","Background: Obesity is a public health issue worldwide. Conversational agents (CAs), also frequently called chatbots, are computer programs that simulate dialogue between people. Owing to better accessibility, cost-effectiveness, personalization, and compassionate patient-centered treatments, CAs are expected to have the potential to provide sustainable lifestyle counseling for weight management. Objective: This systematic review aimed to critically summarize and evaluate clinical studies on the effectiveness and feasibility of CAs with unconstrained natural language input for weight management. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library were searched up to December 2022. Studies were included if CAs were used for weight management and had a capability for unconstrained natural language input. No restrictions were imposed on study design, language, or publication type. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool or the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. The extracted data from the included studies were tabulated and narratively summarized as substantial heterogeneity was expected. Results: In total, 8 studies met the eligibility criteria: 3 (38%) randomized controlled trials and 5 (62%) uncontrolled before-and-after studies. The CAs in the included studies were aimed at behavior changes through education, advice on food choices, or counseling via psychological approaches. Of the included studies, only 38% (3/8) reported a substantial weight loss outcome (1.3-2.4 kg decrease at 12-15 weeks of CA use). The overall quality of the included studies was judged as low. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest that CAs with unconstrained natural language input can be used as a feasible interpersonal weight management intervention by promoting engagement in psychiatric intervention-based conversations simulating treatments by health care professionals, but currently there is a paucity of evidence. Well-designed rigorous randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes, longer treatment duration, and follow-up focusing on CAs' acceptability, efficacy, and safety are warranted. © Eunyoung Noh, Jiyoon Won, Sua Jo, Dae-Hyun Hahm, Hyangsook Lee.

Humanizing Chatbots for Interactive Marketing,"Tsai, W.-H.S.; Chuan, C.-H.","Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, are automated computer programs powered by natural language processing designed to engage consumers in interactive, one-on-one, personalized text- or voice-based conversations. Focusing on text-based, anthropomorphic social chatbots that can be easily implemented on various digital platforms, this chapter synthesizes the literature on computer-mediated communication and human-computer interaction to provide a comprehensive review of the pivotal factors that can enhance chatbots’ perceived humanness and the key considerations in consumer-chatbot interaction and relationship. Specifically, this chapter first discusses the research findings on the persuasiveness of computer-controlled chatbots in relation to human-controlled avatars. Then, the chapter delves into the various anthropomorphic cues used in chatbot design and messaging, including human identity cues, verbal, and non-verbal cues. Strategies and examples for chatbots to communicate humility in order to mitigate consumers’ frustration when chatbots fail to meet consumers’ expectations are also provided. The chapter next addresses some of the most widely studied mediators of chatbot anthropomorphism-social presence and parasocial interaction-and the under-researched role of emotion in consumer-chatbot interactions. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the “uncanny valley” effect pertaining to people’s feelings of eeriness toward highly human-like chatbots. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",2023,,The Palgrave Handbook of Interactive Marketing,,,255-273,,10.1007/978-3-031-14961-0_12,,#5320,Tsai 2023,,,0

We described JITAIs according to their automation level using an established framework (partially, highly, or fully automated), and care workload distribution (requiring work from patients, health care professionals [HCPs], both, or neither). Results: We included 88 JITAIs (62%, n = 55 supported chronic illness management and 12%, n = 11 supported health behavior change). Overall, 77% (n = 68) of JITAIs were missing some information required to replicate the intervention (e.g., n = 38, 43% inadequately reported the algorithm used to select intervention components). Only fifteen (17%) JITAIs were fully automated and did not require additional work from HCPs nor patients. Of the remaining JITAIs, 36% required work from both patients and HCPs, and 47% required work from either patients or HCPs. Conclusion: Most JITAIs are not fully automated and require work from the HCPs and patients. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2023,,Journal of Clinical Epidemiology,154,,108-116,,10.1016/j.jclinepi.2022.12.006,,#5323,Oikonomidi 2023,,,0
Rethinking the Evaluation for Conversational Recommendation in the Era of Large Language Models,"Wang, X.; Tang, X.; Zhao, W.X.; Wang, J.; Wen, J.-R.","The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has shown great potential to develop more powerful conversational recommender systems (CRSs), which rely on natural language conversations to satisfy user needs. In this paper, we embark on an investigation into the utilization of ChatGPT for CRSs, revealing the inadequacy of the existing evaluation protocol. It might overemphasize the matching with ground-truth items annotated by humans while neglecting the interactive nature of CRSs. To overcome the limitation, we further propose an interactive Evaluation approach based on LLMs, named iEvaLM, which harnesses LLM-based user simulators. Our evaluation approach can simulate various system-user interaction scenarios. Through the experiments on two public CRS datasets, we demonstrate notable improvements compared to the prevailing evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we emphasize the evaluation of explainability, and ChatGPT showcases persuasive explanation generation for its recommendations. Our study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the untapped potential of LLMs for CRSs and provides a more flexible and realistic evaluation approach for future research about LLM-based CRSs.

A Tailored and Engaging mHealth Gamified Framework for Nutritional Behaviour Change,"Orte, S.; Migliorelli, C.; Sistach-Bosch, L.; Gómez-Martínez, M.; Boqué, N.","Mobile health applications (apps) have been shown to be effective for improving eating habits. However, most of the existing apps rely on calorie and nutrient counting which have several limitations including the difficulty in sustaining long-term use, inaccuracy, and the risk of developing eating disorders. We designed and developed a mHealth framework for nutritional behaviour change, integrated into the CarpeDiem app, that focuses on the intake of key food groups which are known to have a higher impact on health indicators instead of the intake of nutrients. This framework is mainly based on a gamified system that delivers personalized dietary missions to the user and provides motivational recommendations that help the user to achieve these missions. Its design was guided by an evidenced-based theory of behavioural change, the HAPA model, and it is also characterized by the personalization of the system and the use of a recommender system based on advanced artificial intelligence techniques. Overall, the approach used in the present app could foster a sustained improvement of eating habits among the general population, which is the main challenge of dietary interventions, decreasing the risk of developing the chronic diseases associated with unhealthy dietary habits. © 2023 by the authors.",2023,,Nutrients,15,8,,,10.3390/nu15081950,,#5326,Orte 2023,,,0
Principles and Validations of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Recommender System Suggesting Acceptable Food Changes,"Vandeputte, J.; Herold, P.; Kuslii, M.; Viappiani, P.; Muller, L.; Martin, C.; Davidenko, O.; Delaere, F.; Manfredotti, C.; Cornuéjols, A.; Darcel, N.","Background: Along with the popularity of smartphones, artificial intelligence-based personalized suggestions can be seen as promising ways to change eating habits toward more desirable diets. Objectives: Two issues raised by such technologies were addressed in this study. The first hypothesis tested is a recommender system based on automatically learning simple association rules between dishes of the same meal that would make it possible to identify plausible substitutions for the consumer. The second hypothesis tested is that for an identical set of dietary-swaps suggestions, the more the user is—or thinks to be—involved in the process of identifying the suggestion, the higher is their probability of accepting the suggestion. Methods: Three studies are presented in this article, first, we present the principles of an algorithm to mine plausible substitutions from a large food consumption database. Second, we evaluate the plausibility of these automatically mined suggestions through the results of online tests conducted for a group of 255 adult participants. Afterward, we investigated the persuasiveness of 3 suggestion methods of such recommendations in a population of 27 healthy adult volunteers through a custom designed smartphone application. Results: The results firstly indicated that a method based on automatic learning of substitution rules between foods performed relatively well identifying plausible swaps suggestions. Regarding the form that should be used to suggest, we found that when users are involved in selecting the most appropriate recommendation for them, the resulting suggestions were more accepted (OR = 3.168; P < 0.0004). Conclusions: This work indicates that food recommendation algorithms can gain efficiency by taking into account the consumption context and user engagement in the recommendation process. Further research is warranted to identify nutritionally relevant suggestions. © 2023 American Society for Nutrition",2023,,Journal of Nutrition,153,2,598-604,,10.1016/j.tjnut.2022.12.022,,#5327,Vandeputte 2023,,,0

Designing Supportive Conversational Agents with and for Teens,"Lopatovska, I.; Davis, J.","The study involved adolescents (teens) in exploring the potential of conversational agents (CAs) to support adolescents during emotionally difficult times. During the online focus groups, participants were asked to talk about common problems they are experiencing and the conversational support they usually receive, design multi-turn supportive conversations that could be programmed into a CA, and offer recommendations for the features of supportive CAs for teens. Participants talked about stressful experiences that were reported in previous studies, i.e. school and family related problems, peer relationships, and self-image, suggesting that CAs can be programmed to anticipate and address stress/negative emotions related to these common stressors. In expressing preferences for conversational support, participants highlighted the importance of both cognitive (informational) and emotional dimensions in agents' responses. The findings point to the importance of developing CA content that offers teens advice on strategies to cope with negative emotion (advice on behavior change, self-care strategies), and also simply acknowledges their problems and lands an emotional ""hearing ear"".  © 2023 ACM.",2023,,CHIIR 2023 - Proceedings of the 2023 Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval,,,328-332,,10.1145/3576840.3578283,,#5329,Lopatovska 2023,,,0
Embodied Conversational Agents Providing Motivational Interviewing to Improve Health-Related Behaviors: Scoping Review,"Mercado, J.; Espinosa-Curiel, I.E.; Martínez-Miranda, J.","Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are advanced human-like interfaces that engage users in natural face-to-face conversations and interactions. These traits position ECAs as innovative tools for delivering interventions for promoting health-related behavior adoption. This includes motivational interviewing (MI), a therapeutic approach that combines brief interventions with motivational techniques to encourage the adoption of healthier behaviors. Objective: This study aims to identify the health issues addressed by ECAs delivering MI interventions, explore the key characteristics of these ECAs (eg, appearance, dialogue mechanism, emotional model), analyze the implementation of MI principles and techniques within ECAs, and examine the evaluation methods and primary outcomes of studies that use ECAs providing MI interventions. Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) methodology. Our systematic search covered the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital, and PsycINFO databases for papers published between January 2008 and December 2022. We included papers describing ECAs developed for delivering MI interventions targeting health-related behaviors and excluded articles that did not describe ECAs with human appearances and without the necessary evaluation or MI explanation. In a multistage process, 3 independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction, and the collected data were synthesized using a narrative approach. Results: The initial search identified 404 articles, of which 3.5% (n=14) were included in the review. ECAs primarily focused on reducing alcohol use (n=5, 36%), took on female representations (n=9, 64%), and gave limited consideration to user ethnicity (n=9, 64%). Most of them used rules-driven dialogue mechanisms (n=13, 93%), include emotional behavior to convey empathy (n=8, 57%) but without an automatic recognition of user emotions (n=12, 86%). Regarding MI implementation, of 14 studies, 3 (21%) covered all MI principles, 4 (29%) included all processes, and none covered all techniques. Most studies (8/14, 57%) conducted acceptability, usability, and user experience assessments, whereas a smaller proportion (4/14, 29%) used randomized controlled trials to evaluate behavior changes. Overall, the studies reported positive results regarding acceptability, usability, and user experience and showed promising outcomes in changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Conclusions: This study revealed significant advancements in the use of ECAs for delivering MI interventions aimed at promoting healthier behaviors over the past 15 years. However, this review emphasizes the need for a more in-depth exploration of ECA characteristics. In addition, there is a need for the enhanced integration of MI principles, processes, and techniques into ECAs. Although acceptability and usability have received considerable attention, there is a compelling argument for placing a stronger emphasis on assessing changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Consequently, inclusion of more randomized controlled trials is essential for comprehensive intervention evaluations. ©José Mercado, Ismael Edrein Espinosa-Curiel, Juan Martínez-Miranda.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,1,,,10.2196/52097,,#5330,Mercado 2023,,,0

"Quality, Usability, and Effectiveness of mHealth Apps and the Role of Artificial Intelligence: Current Scenario and Challenges","Deniz-Garcia, A.; Fabelo, H.; Rodriguez-Almeida, A.J.; Zamora-Zamorano, G.; Castro-Fernandez, M.; del Pino Alberiche Ruano, M.; Solvoll, T.; Granja, C.; Schopf, T.R.; Callico, G.M.; Soguero-Ruiz, C.; Wägner, A.M.","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in medicine has increased in recent years. Indeed, the use of AI in mobile health (mHealth) apps could considerably assist both individuals and health care professionals in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, in a person-centered manner. Nonetheless, there are several challenges that must be overcome to provide high-quality, usable, and effective mHealth apps. Here, we review the rationale and guidelines for the implementation of mHealth apps and the challenges regarding quality, usability, and user engagement and behavior change, with a special focus on the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases. We suggest that a cocreation-based framework is the best method to address these challenges. Finally, we describe the current and future roles of AI in improving personalized medicine and provide recommendations for developing AI-based mHealth apps. We conclude that the implementation of AI and mHealth apps for routine clinical practice and remote health care will not be feasible until we overcome the main challenges regarding data privacy and security, quality assessment, and the reproducibility and uncertainty of AI results. Moreover, there is a lack of both standardized methods to measure the clinical outcomes of mHealth apps and techniques to encourage user engagement and behavior changes in the long term. We expect that in the near future, these obstacles will be overcome and that the ongoing European project, Watching the risk factors (WARIFA), will provide considerable advances in the implementation of AI-based mHealth apps for disease prevention and health promotion. © Alejandro Deniz-Garcia, Himar Fabelo, Antonio J Rodriguez-Almeida, Garlene Zamora-Zamorano, Maria Castro-Fernandez, Maria del Pino Alberiche Ruano, Terje Solvoll, Conceição Granja, Thomas Roger Schopf, Gustavo M Callico, Cristina Soguero-Ruiz, Ana M Wägner, WARIFA Consortium.

Leptin deficiency-caused behavioral change – A comparative analysis using EthoVision and DeepLabCut,"Bühler, D.; Power Guerra, N.; Müller, L.; Wolkenhauer, O.; Düffer, M.; Vollmar, B.; Kuhla, A.; Wolfien, M.","Introduction: Obese rodents e.g., the leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mouse exhibit remarkable behavioral changes and are therefore ideal models for evaluating mental disorders resulting from obesity. In doing so, female as well as male ob/ob mice at 8, 24, and 40 weeks of age underwent two common behavioral tests, namely the Open Field test and Elevated Plus Maze, to investigate behavioral alteration in a sex- and age dependent manner. The accuracy of these tests is often dependent on the observer that can subjectively influence the data. Methods: To avoid this bias, mice were tracked with a video system. Video files were further analyzed by the compared use of two software, namely EthoVision (EV) and DeepLabCut (DLC). In DLC a Deep Learning application forms the basis for using artificial intelligence in behavioral research in the future, also with regard to the reduction of animal numbers. Results: After no sex and partly also no age-related differences were found, comparison revealed that both software lead to almost identical results and are therefore similar in their basic outcomes, especially in the determination of velocity and total distance movement. Moreover, we observed additional benefits of DLC compared to EV as it enabled the interpretation of more complex behavior, such as rearing and leaning, in an automated manner. Discussion: Based on the comparable results from both software, our study can serve as a starting point for investigating behavioral alterations in preclinical studies of obesity by using DLC to optimize and probably to predict behavioral observations in the future.

ChatGPT in Education: Angel or Evil? -A Conceptual Model to Explore Educator's Attitude Change toward ChatGPT,"Lei, Y.; Qi, C.","ChatGPT as an innovative AI-based language generation chatbot has drawn a large amount of attention from educators and researchers in academia. Though ChatGPT possesses advanced technological functions, users from the educational field hold different opinions and attitudes toward ChatGPT. As using ChatGPT is becoming a non-stoppable trend, most educators and administrators changed their attitude from panic and prohibition to welcoming and embracing. This paper borrowed the concepts of attitude and attitude change from social psychology, and explained the attitude change toward ChatGPT among educators in higher education. Based on the ABC model of attitude and social judgment theory, we developed a conceptual model of attitude and attitude change from T1 to T2. We propose there will be a significant difference between attitude at T1 and that at T2 and explain such a change by using social judgement theory to highlight the significance of stimuli or persuasive messages from universities. © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,"Proceedings - 2023 5th International Workshop on Artificial Intelligence and Education, WAIE 2023",,,65-69,,10.1109/WAIE60568.2023.00019,,#5336,Lei 2023,,,0

Using Autoepistemic Logics for Understandable and Flexible User-Models,"Wolff, J.; de Boer, V.; Heylen, D.; van Riemsdijk, M.B.","Behavior change support agents are most effective when they are personalized to the user’s goals and motivations. To achieve this the agent should be able to create a user model based on limited initial inputs from the user. We demonstrate how autoepistemic logic can be used to build a model which combines direct input from the user with assumptions about the user’s reasoning. These beliefs can be used when reasoning about the user’s motivations, but they may also be rejected when presented with conflicting information. This results in a user model in which both knowledge and beliefs about the user are included but still clearly separated. We illustrate our ideas using an example of a behavior support agent which assists the user in exercising more. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2023,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3464,,133-136,,,,#5338,Wolff 2023,,,0

Current approaches for obesity prevention based on health information extraction lack the integration of multi-modal datasets and the provision of a dedicated Decision Support System (DSS) for health behaviour assessment and coaching of children. Methods: Continuous co-creation process has been applied in the frame of the Design Thinking Methodology, involving children, educators and healthcare professional in the whole process. Such considerations were used to derive the user needs and the technical requirements needed for the conception of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform based on microservices. Results: To promote the adoption of healthy habits and the prevention of the obesity onset for children (9-12 years old), the proposed solution empowers children -including families and educators- in taking control of their health by collecting and following-up real-time information about nutrition, physical activity data coming from IoT devices, and interconnecting healthcare professionals to provide a personalised coaching solution.

Supporting Adolescent Engagement with Artificial Intelligence-Driven Digital Health Behavior Change Interventions,"Giovanelli, A.; Rowe, J.; Taylor, M.; Berna, M.; Tebb, K.P.; Penilla, C.; Pugatch, M.; Lester, J.; Ozer, E.M.","Understanding and optimizing adolescent-specific engagement with behavior change interventions will open doors for providers to promote healthy changes in an age group that is simultaneously difficult to engage and especially important to affect. For digital interventions, there is untapped potential in combining the vastness of process-level data with the analytical power of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand not only how adolescents engage but also how to improve upon interventions with the goal of increasing engagement and, ultimately, efficacy. Rooted in the example of the INSPIRE narrative-centered digital health behavior change intervention (DHBCI) for adolescent risky behaviors around alcohol use, we propose a framework for harnessing AI to accomplish 4 goals that are pertinent to health care providers and software developers alike: measurement of adolescent engagement, modeling of adolescent engagement, optimization of current interventions, and generation of novel interventions. Operationalization of this framework with youths must be situated in the ethical use of this technology, and we have outlined the potential pitfalls of AI with particular attention to privacy concerns for adolescents.

Argument-based human–AI collaboration for supporting behavior change to improve health,"Kilic, K.; Weck, S.; Kampik, T.; Lindgren, H.","This article presents an empirical requirement elicitation study for an argumentation-based digital companion for supporting behavior change, whose ultimate goal is the promotion and facilitation of healthy behavior. The study was conducted with non-expert users as well as with health experts and was in part supported by the development of prototypes. It focuses on human-centric aspects, in particular user motivations, as well as on expectations and perceptions regarding the role and interaction behavior of a digital companion. Based on the results of the study, a framework for person tailoring the agent's roles and behaviors, and argumentation schemes are proposed. The results indicate that the extent to which a digital companion argumentatively challenges or supports a user's attitudes and chosen behavior and how assertive and provocative the companion is may have a substantial and individualized effect on user acceptance, as well as on the effects of interacting with the digital companion. More broadly, the results shed some initial light on the perception of users and domain experts of “soft,” meta-level aspects of argumentative dialogue, indicating potential for future research.

Health coaching is an effective approach to promoting behavior change in self-management. Health coaching combined with telehealth technology has the potential to improve the overall quality of, and access to, health services. Objective: This protocol outlines the study design for implementing the My Health, My Life, My Way intervention. The study will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention for people with disabilities and optimize it. Methods: The My Health, My Life, My Way study is a 4-arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the delivery of a 6-month intervention involving telecoaching, inclusive educational content, and technology access for 200 individuals with chronic conditions and physical disabilities. This study uses the engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to evaluate intervention components and assess whether a combination or lack of individual elements influences behavior. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 study arms: scheduled coaching calls and gamified rewards, no scheduled coaching calls and gamified rewards, scheduled coaching calls and flat rewards, and no scheduled coaching calls and flat rewards. Results: The My Health, My Life, My Way study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and recruitment and enrollment will begin in May 2023. Data analysis is expected to be completed within 6 months of ending data collection. This clinical trial protocol was developed based on the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 statement. Conclusions: The My Health, My Life, My Way study will help to optimize and improve our understanding of the feasibility and efficacy of a web-based self-management program for people with physical disabilities and chronic conditions. More specifically, My Health, My Life, My Way will determine which combination of interventions (coaching calls and gamification) will result in increased participation in self-management programming. The My Health, My Life, My Way intervention has the potential to become a scalable and novel method to successfully manage chronic conditions in people with disabilities. © Eric Evans, Ayse Zengul, Amy Knight, Amanda Willig, Andrea Cherrington, Tapan Mehta, Mohanraj Thirumalai.",2023,,JMIR Research Protocols,12,,,,10.2196/31694,,#5345,Evans 2023,,,0
The Effects of Anthropomorphism and Explanation Types on User Perception and Acceptance: Implications for Explainable AI,"Tong, J.; Cui, T.; Turel, O.; Du, B.; Cheng, H.","Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) applications are widely used in interactions with end users. However, there remains a lack of understanding of how the different characteristics of these systems, particularly the anthropomorphic design and the type of explanations provided interact to affect user reactions to AI. We address this research gap by building on social response theory (SRT), prior XAI and anthropomorphic design literature, to investigate how anthropomorphic design (human-like vs. machine-like) and types of explanations (consensual, expert, internal, empirical validation-based explanations) affect user reactions to AI (perceived trust and persuasiveness) and acceptance of AI systems. We will evaluate the proposed research model by conducting a 2 × 4 between-subjects experiment. This study will enrich the theoretical landscape of anthropomorphic design and human-AI interaction (HAII), offering actionable insights into user perception and acceptance for XAI practitioners.

A New Index for the Quantitative Evaluation of Surgical Invasiveness Based on Perioperative Patients’ Behavior Patterns: Machine Learning Approach Using Triaxial Acceleration,"Nakanishi, K.; Goto, H.","Background: The minimally invasive nature of thoracoscopic surgery is well recognized; however, the absence of a reliable evaluation method remains challenging. We hypothesized that the postoperative recovery speed is closely linked to surgical invasiveness, where recovery signifies the patient’s behavior transition back to their preoperative state during the perioperative period. Objective: This study aims to determine whether machine learning using triaxial acceleration data can effectively capture perioperative behavior changes and establish a quantitative index for quantifying variations in surgical invasiveness. Methods: We trained 7 distinct machine learning models using a publicly available human acceleration data set as supervised data. The 3 top-performing models were selected to predict patient actions, as determined by the Matthews correlation coefficient scores. Two patients who underwent different levels of invasive thoracoscopic surgery were selected as participants. Acceleration data were collected via chest sensors for 8 hours during the preoperative and postoperative hospitalization days. These data were categorized into 4 actions (walking, standing, sitting, and lying down) using the selected models. The actions predicted by the model with intermediate results were adopted as the actions of the participants. The daily appearance probability was calculated for each action. The 2 differences between 2 appearance probabilities (sitting vs standing and lying down vs walking) were calculated using 2 coordinates on the x-and y-axes. A 2D vector composed of coordinate values was defined as the index of behavior pattern (iBP) for the day. All daily iBPs were graphed, and the enclosed area and distance between points were calculated and compared between participants to assess the relationship between changes in the indices and invasiveness. Results: Patients 1 and 2 underwent lung lobectomy and incisional tumor biopsy, respectively. The selected predictive model was a light-gradient boosting model (mean Matthews correlation coefficient 0.98, SD 0.0027; accuracy: 0.98). The acceleration data yielded 548,466 points for patient 1 and 466,407 points for patient 2. The iBPs of patient 1 were [(0.32, 0.19), (–0.098, 0.46), (–0.15, 0.13), (–0.049, 0.22)] and those of patient 2 were [(0.55, 0.30), (0.77, 0.21), (0.60, 0.25), (0.61, 0.31)]. The enclosed areas were 0.077 and 0.0036 for patients 1 and 2, respectively. Notably, the distances for patient 1 were greater than those for patient 2 ({0.44, 0.46, 0.37, 0.26} vs {0.23, 0.0065, 0.059}; P=.03 [Mann-Whitney U test]). Conclusions: The selected machine learning model effectively predicted the actions of the surgical patients with high accuracy. The temporal distribution of action times revealed changes in behavior patterns during the perioperative phase. The proposed index may facilitate the recognition and visualization of perioperative changes in patients and differences in surgical invasiveness. © Kozo Nakanishi, Hidenori Goto.",2023,,JMIR Perioperative Medicine,6,1,,,10.2196/50188,,#5348,Nakanishi 2023,,,0
Evaluation of prototype risk prediction tools for clinicians and people living with type 2 diabetes in North West London using the think aloud method,"Gardner, C.; Wake, D.; Brodie, D.; Silverstein, A.; Young, S.; Cunningham, S.; Sainsbury, C.; Ilia, M.; Lucas, A.; Willis, T.; Halligan, J.","The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in North West London (NWL) is relatively high compared to other parts of the United Kingdom with outcomes suboptimal. This presents a need for more effective strategies to identify people living with type 2 diabetes who need additional support. An emerging subset of web-based interventions for diabetes self-management and population management has used artificial intelligence and machine learning models to stratify the risk of complications from diabetes and identify patients in need of immediate support. In this study, two prototype risk prediction tools on the MyWay Diabetes and MyWay Clinical platforms were evaluated with six clinicians and six people living with type 2 diabetes in NWL using the think aloud method. The results of the sessions with people living with type 2 diabetes showed that the concept of the tool was intuitive, however, more instruction on how to correctly use the risk prediction tool would be valuable. The feedback from the sessions with clinicians was that the data presented in the tool aligned with the key diabetes targets in NWL, and that this would be useful for identifying and inviting patients to the practice who are overdue for tests and at risk of complications. The findings of the evaluation have been used to support the development of the prototype risk predictions tools. This study demonstrates the value of conducting usability testing on web-based interventions designed to support the targeted management of type 2 diabetes in local communities. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Digital Health,9,,,,10.1177/20552076221128677,,#5349,Gardner 2023,,,0
Demystifying the Role of AIoT for Sustainable WASH Conditions: Analysis and Research Directions,"Kotecha, R.","With increasing population, expanding human activities and the effects of climate change, ensuring adequate Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) conditions are crucial for the healthcare, development and well-being of nations and their citizens. The inclusion of WASH within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflects the need to adopt innovative approaches for providing the necessary WASH infrastructure and services. Data Analytics on the WASH indicators help monitor the progress of WASH initiatives, infrastructure availability and conditions, service levels, WASH-related behavior changes, etc. and guide the development of early warning systems. Hence, this work applies Data Analytics on the WASH records from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) to enable efficient and effective WASH analysis and interventions. Further, the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and their amalgamation as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) have the potential to bring transformative changes to WASH practices. This work presents various research directions for addressing the challenges in the WASH sector by implementing AI algorithms on real-time data procured by IoT devices.

Notifying Users: Customisation Preferences for Notifications in Health and Well-being Applications,"Pretolesi, D.; Motnikar, L.; Till, B.; Uhl, J.","In mobile technologies for health and well-being (mHealth), push notifications are a widely used tool to implement persuasive strategies. However, little research has been carried out to investigate the impact of notifications in such technologies and users’ attitudes towards them. In this study, we address this gap by exploring the role of notifications and their customisation in the context of mobile applications that promote social and mental well-being. Based on observational data collected from 152 participants, we investigate users’ attitudes and preferences towards notifications. Moreover, we explore how users’ attitudes towards notifications differ along demographic dimensions. Our findings show that customisation of notifications is a desired feature that can be used to improve the persuasive aspect of mHealth applications. Implications derived from our study can provide guidance for researchers and practitioners alike when designing app notifications to create better motivating, meaningful, and persuasive experiences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13832 LNCS,,410-424,,10.1007/978-3-031-30933-5_26,,#5353,Pretolesi 2023,,,0
Introducing Multi-modality in Persuasive Task Oriented Virtual Sales Agent,"Raut, A.; Das, S.; Tiwari, A.; Saha, S.; Maitra, A.; Ramnani, R.; Sengupta, S.","In recent years, the usage of virtual assistants to complete tasks like service scheduling and online shopping has increased in both popularity and need. An end user’s task goals are the main objectives of a task-oriented conversation agent, and those should be served effectively and successfully. Beside that, user satisfaction is one of the most important aspect that should be taken care of. Communication with multi-modal responses makes the conversation easier and more attractive. Responses through proper images can improve the quality of a task oriented conversation in terms of user satisfaction. Keeping these aspects in mind, we propose a framework which infuses multi-modality with an end-to-end persuasive task oriented dialogue generation module. Additionally, we create a personalised persuasive multi-modal dialogue (PPMD) corpus with slot, sentiment, and agent action annotation at turn level that contains multi-modal responses from both ends.

Expressive Interviewing Agents to Support Health-Related Behavior Change: Randomized Controlled Study of COVID-19 Behaviors,"Stewart, I.; Welch, C.; An, L.; Resnicow, K.; Pennebaker, J.; Mihalcea, R.","Background: Expressive writing and motivational interviewing are well-known approaches to help patients cope with stressful life events. Although these methods are often applied by human counselors, it is less well understood if an automated artificial intelligence approach can benefit patients. Providing an automated method would help expose a wider range of people to the possible benefits of motivational interviewing, with lower cost and more adaptability to sudden events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study presents an automated writing system and evaluates possible outcomes among participants with respect to behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We developed a rule-based dialogue system for “Expressive Interviewing” to elicit writing from participants on the subject of how COVID-19 has impacted their lives. The system prompts participants to describe their life experiences and emotions and provides topic-specific prompts in response to participants’ use of topical keywords. In May 2021 and June 2021, we recruited participants (N=151) via Prolific to complete either the Expressive Interviewing task or a control task. We surveyed participants immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and again 2 weeks after the intervention. We measured participants’ self-reported stress, general mental health, COVID-19–related health behavior, and social behavior. Results: Participants generally wrote long responses during the task (53.3 words per response). In aggregate, task participants experienced a significant decrease in stress in the short term (~23% decrease, P<.001) and a slight difference in social activity compared with the control group (P=.03). No significant differences in short-term or long-term outcomes were detected between participant subgroups (eg, male versus female participants) except for some within-condition differences by ethnicity (eg, higher social activity among African American people participating in Expressive Interviewing vs participants of other ethnicities). For short-term effects, participants showed different outcomes based on their writing. Using more anxiety-related words was correlated with a greater short-term decrease in stress (r=–0.264, P<.001), and using more positive emotion words was correlated with a more meaningful experience (r=0.243, P=.001). As for long-term effects, writing with more lexical diversity was correlated with an increase in social activity (r=0.266, P<.001). Conclusions: Expressive Interviewing participants exhibited short-term, but not long-term, positive changes in mental health, and some linguistic metrics of writing style were correlated with positive change in behavior. Although there were no significant long-term effects observed, the positive short-term effects suggest that the Expressive Interviewing intervention could be used in cases in which a patient lacks access to traditional therapy and needs a short-term solution. © Ian Stewart, Charles Welch, Lawrence An, Ken Resnicow, James Pennebaker, Rada Mihalcea.",2023,,JMIR Formative Research,7,,,,10.2196/40277,,#5355,Stewart 2023,,,0
"Digitalization, Extended Reality and Artificial Intelligence in Explosive Ordnance Risk Education","Hegedus, E.; Tick, A.","Digital innovations in Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) are gaining increasing importance with the rapid development of technology and need for a combination of online and offline, in-person and remote delivery.

Artificial Intelligence–Based Chatbots for Promoting Health Behavioral Changes: Systematic Review,"Aggarwal, A.; Tam, C.C.; Wu, D.; Li, X.; Qiao, S.","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)–based chatbots can offer personalized, engaging, and on-demand health promotion interventions. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior change. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated the feasibility or efficacy of AI chatbots for behavior change. The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles were performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6, 40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1, 7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and expert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of the moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI techniques, and limitation for generalizability. Conclusions: AI chatbots have demonstrated the efficacy of health behavior change interventions among large and diverse populations; however, future studies need to adopt robust randomized control trials to establish definitive conclusions. © Abhishek Aggarwal, Cheuk Chi Tam, Dezhi Wu, Xiaoming Li, Shan Qiao.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,,,,10.2196/40789,,#5357,Aggarwal 2023,,,0
MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS IN THE ERA OF DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION,"Nesterenko, V.; Miskiewicz, R.; Abazov, R.","The advent of digital transformation has revolutionized the marketing landscape, presenting both challenges and opportunities for businesses. This scientific paper delves into the realm of marketing communications in the context of this transformative era. The primary objective is to examine the profound impact of various marketing communication tools on consumer perception and response to advertising messages, direct marketing, electronic communication, and other innovative marketing techniques. Utilizing the ANOVA (analysis of variance) statistical evaluation method, comprehensive empirical research data are analysed to uncover key trends and insights. The findings shed light on the dynamic market developments characterized by a notable decline in the effectiveness of traditional mass marketing approaches. Instead, there is a discernible shift towards more specialized marketing strategies, bolstered by the rapid advancement of computer and information technologies. Moreover, this study confirms a hypothesis pertaining to the efficacy of Internet advertising in relation to different age groups of customers. This confirmation underscores the importance of leveraging digital platforms and channels to engage specific target audiences effectively. The practical significance of this research lies in its potential to guide marketers in optimizing their marketing budgets, identifying the most impactful communication channels, and discerning statistically significant variations in consumer responses to diverse marketing communication tools. By understanding these nuances, marketers can design more targeted and persuasive marketing campaigns, leading to enhanced customer engagement and improved business outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

Enhancing the Integrity of the Sentencing Process through the Use of Artificial Intelligence,"Bagaric, M.; Hunter, D.","The likelihood that a defendant will reoffend is one of the key considerations that informs sentencing outcomes. It is relevant to the aims of community protection, specific deterrence, and rehabilitation. Despite this, empirical data establishes that judges make poor predictions regarding whether defendants will reoffend. Algorithms are being increasingly used in some parts of the United States to determine the risk that offenders will commit other crimes. This practice has come under considerable criticism for a range of reasons. This chapter examines the persuasiveness of criticisms of sentencing algorithms, discusses the relative limitations of both human and computational decision-making, and argues that properly designed artificial intelligence systems can significantly enhance the integrity of the sentencing process. © Oxford University Press 2022.

Deepest Mediatization? Inventing the Autonomous Vehicle,"Miller, J.","The fully autonomous vehicle (AV) promises to be both a prototypic example of deep mediatization in the built environment and the apotheosis of the mediatized automobile. Autonomy has been an elusive goal, however. Its achievement will depend on a persuasive sociotechnical imaginary (STI), along with breakthroughs in digital technology. The latter involve advanced artificial intelligence, of course, but also the transformation of the nature of media, a dynamic that goes well beyond the mere proliferation of in-car media. After exploring “media” and automotive deep mediatization, this article dwells on neglected examples of existing mobile autonomy. It then turns to STIs in general, which are visionary articulations of pioneering communities, and the American AV STI in particular. This is constructed through a close reading of recent semipopular publications that mostly promote the desirability of vehicular autonomy. The article concludes critically, with analysis of the unpersuasiveness of the current American AV STI, the vehicle in AV, and the transformation of media. © 2023 (James Miller).

Impact of Artificial Intelligence on DOOH Advertising: Message-Persuasion Level Enhancement Using Illusion Board and Personalized Insights,"Mršić, L.","The marketing, more precisely, advertising industry has always been driven by the pursuit of personalization, precise identification of target groups, attracting the right audience and attribution for the least effort with the lowest cost. In order for this technique to be successful, it requires a significant and deep knowledge of the audience. That deep knowledge relies on data science, especially in marketing areas of search engine optimization, customer engagement, responsiveness, profiling and real-time marketing campaigns. Moreover, new ways to apply data science and analytics in marketing emerge every day as we witness activities like extreme personalization, micro-targeting, micro-segmentation, and many others. And as result OOH (“out-of-home advertising”) was disregarded until recently because of its lack of ability to provide attribution or consumer data. Nevertheless, transformation from traditional out-of-home advertising to digital out-of-home (“DOOH”) advertising or any “digital media endorsing audio and video messages related to products or services outside of the home”, illustrates how the advertising industry is leveraging new technologies to continue the pursuit of personalization and customization. Our research starts with traditional OOH and expand to usage of anamorphic illusion technology, which is the art of bending images through optical illusions which rely on viewers to be standing or viewing from a specific angle to actually see or realize the full effect of the finished creative. Being able to predict where viewers will stand, based on illusion board content, our research provide methodology which brings platform for message-persuasion level enhancement by collecting anonymized data and turn them into business-driven personalized insights.

Metrics for Evaluating Explainable Recommender Systems,"Hulstijn, J.; Tchappi, I.; Najjar, A.; Aydoğan, R.","Recommender systems aim to support their users by reducing information overload so that they can make better decisions. Recommender systems must be transparent, so users can form mental models about the system’s goals, internal state, and capabilities, that are in line with their actual design. Explanations and transparent behaviour of the system should inspire trust and, ultimately, lead to more persuasive recommendations. Here, explanations convey reasons why a recommendation is given or how the system forms its recommendations. This paper focuses on the question how such claims about effectiveness of explanations can be evaluated. Accordingly, we investigate various models that are used to assess the effects of explanations and recommendations. We discuss objective and subjective measurement and argue that both are needed. We define a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of explanations and recommendations. The feasibility of using these metrics is discussed in the context of a specific explainable recommender system in the food and health domain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14127 LNAI,,212-230,,10.1007/978-3-031-40878-6_12,,#5365,Hulstijn 2023,,,0

Virtual emotions and Criminal Law,"González-Tapia, M.I.","This article examines the role that Criminal Law should play in regulating the non-therapeutic use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR), specifically its massive use by consumers. The starting point has been to consider VR as an intermediate risk scenario, for the purposes of Criminal Law, between the criminality entirely generated in the physical world and that developed in the 2D digital environments [cybercrimes and criminality linked to social networks and persuasive Artificial Intelligence (AI)]. Firstly, specialize literature has been analyzed to establish the nature of virtual reality. From a technical standpoint, virtual reality is a neurotechnology infused with high-risk artificial intelligence; an inseparable synthesis of non-invasive neurotechnology and a set of AI systems, considered high-risk for the fundamental rights of citizens. From the perspective of its functioning, VR is a “transformative” neurotechnology capable of altering what people perceive as reality. This is possible, because its realism lies in the emotional immersion of the user in the virtual experience, similarly to how our brain functions. Therefore, the key idea in the immersive functioning of virtual reality is its capacity to evoke and modify human emotions, which results its greater harmful potential compared to the 2D environment. From there, three central and specific areas of (legally unaddressed) risk arise: (1) the special comprehensive nature of the data collected and stored during its use; (2) its ability to mentally reproduce the “physical” experience of the avatar in the user; and (3) its significant capacity to manipulate individuals. Secondly, the paper examines both the reported cases and the foreseeable criminality in virtual worlds or “proto-metaverse,” focusing on the three risk areas, and exemplifying them with attacks on mental privacy, sexual freedom, and consumer manipulation. Finally, it is proposed that Criminal Law should also intervene (as soon as possible) to define the “red lines” of massive virtual reality use by citizens. With a democratic and human-centered approach, a basic legal framework is outlined for the criminalization of specific harms and risks associated with virtual reality, adapting the existing legal framework as necessary.

With its broad, application-agnostic nature, the IBCM provides insight into behavior change, how it operates, and offers an alternative explanation for why various behavior change models work or do not work. It has applications as a behavioral system for education, research, analysis, intervention design, and implementation in various technologies, especially self-adaptive systems run by rule-based engines or artificial intelligence (AI). Due to space limits, this paper covers the model structure and theory with a limited high-level overview of its ontology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13977 LNCS,,145-160,,10.1007/978-3-031-39764-6_10,,#5368,Cugelman 2023,,,0

Crowdsourced Argumentation Feedback for Persuasive Writing,"Ihoriya, H.; Yamamoto, Y.","In this paper, we propose a method for generating feedback to improve an argumentation’s persuasiveness by utilizing multiple crowd workers. This method is aimed at mitigating the typically time-consuming task of providing feedback on argumentation documents, which often falls solely on the author’s supervisor or teacher. The proposed method divides the task argument improvement into three types of micro-tasks: (1) classifying opinions vs. facts, (2) checking that evidence is given to support the facts, and (3) checking that a rationale is given to support the opinions. These micro-tasks are allocated to the crowd workers and executed asynchronously to achieve efficient feedback generation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),14016 LNCS,,461-475,,10.1007/978-3-031-35129-7_33,,#5371,Ihoriya 2023,,,0
Conversational artificial intelligence interventions to support smoking cessation: A systematic review and meta-analysis,"Bendotti, H.; Lawler, S.; Chan, G.C.K.; Gartner, C.; Ireland, D.; Marshall, H.M.","Background: Conversational artificial intelligence (chatbots and dialogue systems) is an emerging tool for tobacco cessation that has the potential to emulate personalised human support and increase engagement. We aimed to determine the effect of conversational artificial intelligence interventions with or without standard tobacco cessation interventions on tobacco cessation outcomes among adults who smoke, compared to no intervention, placebo intervention or an active comparator. Methods: A comprehensive search of six databases was completed in June 2022. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials published since 2005. The primary outcome was sustained tobacco abstinence, self-reported and/or biochemically validated, for at least 6 months. Secondary outcomes included point-prevalence abstinence and sustained abstinence of less than 6 months. Two authors independently extracted data on cessation outcomes and completed the risk of bias assessment. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Results: From 819 studies, five randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria (combined sample size n = 58,796). All studies differed in setting, methodology, intervention, participants and end-points. Interventions included chatbots embedded in multi- and single-component smartphone apps (n = 3), a social media-based (n = 1) chatbot, and an internet-based avatar (n = 1). Random effects meta-analysis of three studies found participants in the conversational artificial intelligence enhanced intervention were significantly more likely to quit smoking at 6-month follow-up compared to control group participants (RR = 1.29, 95% CI (1.13, 1.46), p < 0.001). Loss to follow up was generally high. Risk of bias was high overall. Conclusion: We found limited but promising evidence on the effectiveness of conversational artificial intelligence interventions for tobacco cessation. Although all studies found benefits from conversational artificial intelligence interventions, results should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity. Given the rapid evolution and potential of artificial intelligence interventions, further well-designed randomised controlled trials following standardised reporting guidelines are warranted in this emerging area. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Digital Health,9,,,,10.1177/20552076231211634,,#5372,Bendotti 2023,,,0

The Role of a Smart Health Ecosystem in Transforming the Management of Chronic Health Conditions,"Nourse, R.; Dingler, T.; Kelly, J.; Kwasnicka, D.; Maddison, R.","The effective management of chronic conditions requires an approach that promotes a shift in care from the clinic to the home, improves the efficiency of health care systems, and benefits all users irrespective of their needs and preferences. Digital health can provide a solution to this challenge, and in this paper, we provide our vision for a smart health ecosystem. A smart health ecosystem leverages the interoperability of digital health technologies and advancements in big data and artificial intelligence for data collection and analysis and the provision of support. We envisage that this approach will allow a comprehensive picture of health, personalization, and tailoring of behavioral and clinical support; drive theoretical advancements; and empower people to manage their own health with support from health care professionals. We illustrate the concept with 2 use cases and discuss topics for further consideration and research, concluding with a message to encourage people with chronic conditions, their caregivers, health care professionals, policy and decision makers, and technology experts to join their efforts and work toward adopting a smart health ecosystem. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

The Anti-Seizure Effect of Liraglutide on Ptz-Induced Convulsions Through its Anti-Oxidant and Anti-Inflammatory Properties,"Erdogan, M.A.; Erdogan, A.; Erbas, O.","Epilepsy is a prevalent and frequently devastating neurological disorder defined by recurring spontaneous seizures caused by aberrant electrical activity in the brain. Over ten million people worldwide suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy. This severe condition requires novel treatment approaches. Both oxidative and nitrosative stress are thought to have a role in the etiology of epilepsy. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is used to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus. According to recent studies, Liraglutide also shows neuroprotective properties, improving memory retention and total hippocampus pyramidal neuronal population in mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the anti-seizure and anti-oxidative effects of liraglutide in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of epilepsy. 48 rats were randomly assigned to two groups: those who had electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and those who underwent behavioral assessment. Rats received either intraperitoneal (IP) liraglutide at two different dosages (3–6 mg/kg) or a placebo, followed by pentylenetetrazole (IP). To determine if liraglutide has anti-seizure characteristics, we examined seizure activity in rats using EEG, the Racine convulsion scale (RCS), the time of first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), and MDA, SOD, TNF-α, IL-1β and GAD-67 levels. The mean EEG spike wave percentage score was reduced from 75.8% (placebo) to 59.4% (lower-dose) and 41.5% (higher-dose). FMJ had increased from a mean of 70.6 s (placebo) to 181.2 s (lower-dose) and 205.2 s (higher-dose). RCS was reduced from a mean of 5.5 (placebo) to 2.7 (lower-dose) and 2.4 (higher-dose). Liraglutide (3 and 6 mg/kg i.p.) successfully decreased the spike percentages and RCS associated with PTZ induced epilepsy, as well as considerably decreased MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β and elevated SOD, GAD-67 levels in rat brain. Liraglutide significantly decreased seizure activity at both dosages when compared to control, most likely due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The potential clinical role of liraglutide as an anti-seizure medication should be further explored. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2023,,Neurochemical Research,48,1,188-195,,10.1007/s11064-022-03736-4,,#5377,Erdogan 2023,,,0

Learning analytics for lifelong career development: a framework to support sustainable formative assessment and self-reflection in programs developing career self-efficacy,"Brass, T.; Kennedy, J.; Gabriel, F.; Neill, B.; Devis, D.; Leonard, S.N.","Among myriad complex challenges facing educational institutions in this era of a rapidly evolving job marketplace is the development of career self-efficacy among students. Self-efficacy has traditionally been understood to be developed through the direct experience of competence, the vicarious experience of competence, social persuasion, and physiological cues. These four factors, and particularly the first two, are difficult to build into education and training programs in a context where changing skills make the specific meaning of graduate competence largely unknown and, notwithstanding the other contributions in this collection, largely unknowable. In response, in this paper we argue for a working metacognitive model of career self-efficacy that will prepare students with the skills needed to evaluate their skills, attitudes and values and then adapt and develop them as their career context evolves around them. The model we will present is one of evolving complex sub-systems within an emergent milieu. In identifying various contributing factors, the model provides specific cognitive and affective constructs as important targets for actionable learning analytics for career development.

Unisa at SemEval-2023 Task 3: A SHAP-based method for Propaganda Detection,"Bangerter, M.; Fenza, G.; Gallo, M.; Loia, V.; Volpe, A.; De Maio, C.; Stanzione, C.","This paper presents proposed solutions for addressing two subtasks in SemEval-2023 Task 3: “Detecting the Genre, the Framing, and the Persuasion techniques in online news in a multilingual setup”. In subtask 1, “News Genre Categorisation”, the goal is to classify a news article as an opinion, a report, or a satire. In subtask 3, “Detection of Persuasion Technique”, the system must reveal persuasion techniques used in each news article paragraph choosing among 23 defined methods. Solutions leverage the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). In subtask 1, SHAP was used to understand what was driving the model to fail so that it could be improved accordingly. In contrast, in subtask 3, a re-calibration of the Attention Mechanism was realized by extracting critical tokens for each persuasion technique. The underlying idea is the exploitation of XAI for countering the over-fitting of the resulting model and attempting to improve the performance when there are few samples in the training data. The achieved performance on English for subtask 1 ranked 6th with an F1-score of 58.6% (despite 78.4% of the 1st) and for subtask 3 ranked 12th with a micro-averaged F1-score of 29.8% (despite 37.6% of the 1st). © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2023,,"17th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation, SemEval 2023 - Proceedings of the Workshop",,,885-891,,,,#5380,Bangerter 2023,,,0
MINDSET: A benchMarking suIte exploring seNsing Data for SElf sTates inference,"Karagianni, C.; Paraschou, E.; Yfantidou, S.; Vakali, A.","Ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring user behavior, health, and well-being. Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric adaptiveness, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the vital need to tailor and personalize ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the lack of user profiling and the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end, we show that the automatically passively collected sensing data from the wearables can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user states relevant to demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, complementing the need for time-consuming self-reports. To accomplish this task, and enable the reproducibility and extensibility of our work; we propose an extensive benchmark suite by exploiting sensing data harvested from ubiquitous devices.Our benchmark covers a wide range of personalization tasks, including modeling gender, age, personality states, and stress, experimenting on the publicly available, newly released LifeSnaps dataset containing over 71 million rows of data capturing the daily lives of 71 participants in their naturalistic environments. The proposed benchmarking continuum showcases the strong potential for the applicability of the presented work in critical applications, such as mental healthcare monitoring, privacy preservation, and responsible artificial intelligence (AI), by fostering fairness assessments when protected attribute knowledge is unavailable. © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,"2023 IEEE 10th International Conference on Data Science and Advanced Analytics, DSAA 2023 - Proceedings",,,,,10.1109/DSAA60987.2023.10302638,,#5382,Karagianni 2023,,,0

Linking Ethnicity Targeting with Artificial Intelligence and Data Collection: Perceptions and Behavioral Responses of Black Consumers,"Zhang, W.; Rodgers, S.","Data-centric targeting with artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming advertising by using machine learning and big data to target consumers, creating value for both consumers and brands. Despite the growing interest in ethnicity targeting in social media, there is still much to learn about leveraging ethnicity data for advertising research and practice. In this study, we surveyed 1,030 Black U.S. social media users to explore their understanding of AI and data gathering related to ethnicity. We focused on ethnic affinity targeting (EAT), a controversial tactic used by social media platforms. Our results indicate that the ethical aspects of persuasion knowledge, specifically appropriateness beliefs, affect consumers’ coping strategies through distinct mechanisms. Consumers’ ethnic identification and the stability of their affinity feelings toward social media also influence intentions to use specific coping strategies. These findings suggest that consumers’ perceptions of ethnicity targeting depend on how advertisers collect and use ethnicity data and underscore the importance of diverse perspectives to inform algorithm transparency practices and policies. © 2023 American Academy of Advertising.",2023,,Journal of Current Issues and Research in Advertising,44,3,373-391,,10.1080/10641734.2023.2212022,,#5384,Zhang 2023,,,0

From Didachography to AI: Metaphors Teaching is Automated by,"Ferreira, G.M.D.S.; Lemgruber, M.S.; Cabrera, T.L.","Although automation is not a novelty, high hopes are currently pinned on more and more ingenious devices built with Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has become a key discussion point in the agendas of governments and multinational agencies, with particular interest in educational applications. This article explores parallels between ideas surrounding AI in education and conceptions proposed in the 17th century by Jan Amos Comenius, known as the father of modern education. Drawing upon illustrations from ongoing research that takes metaphor as its core analytical category, the piece assumes that metaphors are not mere stylistic elements, but strategic persuasive devices. Comenius’ didachography, a portmanteau coined in his 1657 Didactica Magna to describe an inclusive educational system, relies heavily on metaphors that suggest remarkable similarities with contemporary EdTech rhetoric, especially on AI-related developments. Whilst exemplifying that ideas and premises entailed in current discourses on EdTech may hark back to centuries-old ideas, the paper argues that, despite taking on varying, contextually situated linguistic expressions, underlying metaphors appear to have endured from Comenius’ time to support the advent of an educational system poised to automate teaching and, thus, dispense with a key part of his scheme: the teacher. In closing, the piece suggests that we may need to acknowledge the contingent nature of teaching and learning, perhaps accepting that key aspects of what makes us human may always resist engineering. © 2023 The Author(s).",2023,,Journal of Interactive Media in Education,2023,1,,,10.5334/jime.798,,#5386,Ferreira 2023,,,0
Development of an Alcohol Refusal Training in Immersive Virtual Reality for Patients With Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disability and Alcohol Use Disorder: Cocreation With Experts in Addiction Care,"Langener, S.; Kolkmeier, J.; VanDerNagel, J.; Klaassen, R.; van Manen, J.; Heylen, D.","Background: People with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID; IQ=50-85) are at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). One factor contributing to this risk is sensitivity to peer pressure. Hence, tailored trainings are needed to practice alcohol refusal in impacted patients. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) appears promising to engage patients in dialogs with virtual humans, allowing to practice alcohol refusal realistically. However, requirements for such an IVR have not been studied for MBID/AUD. Objective: This study aims to develop an IVR alcohol refusal training for patients with MBID and AUD. In this work, we cocreated our peer pressure simulation with experienced experts in addiction care. Methods: We followed the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model to develop our IVR alcohol refusal training. With 5 experts from a Dutch addiction clinic for patients with MBID, we held 3 focus groups to design the virtual environment, persuasive virtual human(s), and persuasive dialog. Subsequently, we developed our initial IVR prototype and conducted another focus group to evaluate IVR and procedures for clinical usage, resulting in our final peer pressure simulation. Results: Our experts described visiting a friend at home with multiple friends as the most relevant peer pressure situation in the clinical setting. Based on the identified requirements, we developed a social-housing apartment with multiple virtual friends present. Moreover, we embedded a virtual man with generic appearance to exert peer pressure using a persuasive dialog. Patients can respond to persuasive attempts by selecting (refusal) responses with varying degrees of risk for relapse in alcohol use. Our evaluation showed that experts value a realistic and interactable IVR. However, experts identified lacking persuasive design elements, such as paralanguage, for our virtual human. For clinical usage, a user-centered customization is needed to prevent adverse effects. Further, interventions should be therapist delivered to avoid try-and-error in patients with MBID. Lastly, we identified factors for immersion, as well as facilitators and barriers for IVR accessibility. Conclusions: Our work establishes an initial PSD for IVR for alcohol refusal trainings in patients with MBID and AUD. With this, scholars can create comparable simulations by performing an analogous cocreation, replicate findings, and identify active PSD elements. For peer pressure, conveying emotional information in a virtual human’s voice (eg, paralanguage) seems vital. However, previous rapport building may be needed to ensure that virtual humans are perceived as cognitively capable entities. Future work should validate our PSD with patients and start developing IVR treatment protocols using interdisciplinary teams. © Simon Langener, Jan Kolkmeier, Joanne VanDerNagel, Randy Klaassen, Jeannette van Manen, Dirk Heylen.",2023,,JMIR Formative Research,7,,,,10.2196/42523,,#5387,Langener 2023,,,0

Unveiling the Power of Argument Arrangement in Online Persuasive Discussions,"Mirzakhmedova, N.; Kiesel, J.; Al-Khatib, K.; Stein, B.","Previous research on argumentation in online discussions has largely focused on examining individual comments and neglected the interactive nature of discussions. In line with previous work, we represent individual comments as sequences of semantic argumentative unit types. However, because it is intuitively necessary for dialogical argumentation to address the opposing viewpoints, we extend this model by clustering type sequences into different argument arrangement patterns and representing discussions as sequences of these patterns. These sequences of patterns are a symbolic representation of argumentation strategies that capture the overall structure of discussions. Using this novel approach, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the strategies in 34,393 discussions from the online discussion forum Change My View and show that our discussion model is effective for persuasiveness prediction, outperforming LLM-based classifiers on the same data. Our results provide valuable insights into argumentation dynamics in online discussions and, through the presented prediction procedure, are of practical importance for writing assistance and persuasive text generation systems. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.",2023,,Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics: EMNLP 2023,,,15659-15671,,10.18653/v1/2023.findings-emnlp.1048,,#5390,Mirzakhmedova 2023,,,0
Mining Sensor Data to Assess Changes in Physical Activity Behaviors in Health Interventions: Systematic Review,"Diaz, C.; Caillaud, C.; Yacef, K.","Background: Sensors are increasingly used in health interventions to unobtrusively and continuously capture participants’ physical activity in free-living conditions. The rich granularity of sensor data offers great potential for analyzing patterns and changes in physical activity behaviors. The use of specialized machine learning and data mining techniques to detect, extract, and analyze these patterns has increased, helping to better understand how participants’ physical activity evolves. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to identify and present the various data mining techniques employed to analyze changes in physical activity behaviors from sensors-derived data in health education and health promotion intervention studies. We addressed two main research questions: (1) What are the current techniques used for mining physical activity sensor data to detect behavior changes in health education or health promotion contexts? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities in mining physical activity sensor data for detecting physical activity behavior changes? Methods: The systematic review was performed in May 2021 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We queried the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Springer literature databases for peer-reviewed references related to wearable machine learning to detect physical activity changes in health education. A total of 4388 references were initially retrieved from the databases. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 285 references were subjected to full-text review, resulting in 19 articles included for analysis. Results: All studies used accelerometers, sometimes in combination with another sensor (37%). Data were collected over a period ranging from 4 days to 1 year (median 10 weeks) from a cohort size ranging between 10 and 11615 (median 74). Data preprocessing was mainly carried out using proprietary software, generally resulting in step counts and time spent in physical activity aggregated predominantly at the daily or minute level. The main features used as input for the data mining models were descriptive statistics of the preprocessed data. The most common data mining methods were classifiers, clusters, and decision-making algorithms, and these focused on personalization (58%) and analysis of physical activity behaviors (42%). Conclusions: Mining sensor data offers great opportunities to analyze physical activity behavior changes, build models to better detect and interpret behavior changes, and allow for personalized feedback and support for participants, especially where larger sample sizes and longer recording times are available. Exploring different data aggregation levels can help detect subtle and sustained behavior changes. However, the literature suggests that there is still work remaining to improve the transparency, explicitness, and standardization of the data preprocessing and mining processes to establish best practices and make the detection methods easier to understand, scrutinize, and reproduce. ©Claudio Diaz, Corinne Caillaud, Kalina Yacef.",2023,,JMIR Medical Informatics,11,,,,10.2196/41153,,#5392,Diaz 2023,,,0
Automated GUI Testing for Enhancing User Experience (UX): A Survey of the State of the Art,"Deshmukh, P.S.; Date, S.S.; Mahalle, P.N.; Barot, J.","Recent developments in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have broadened opportunities for users to interact with various technologies.

Technology to the Rescue? Considerations for Behaviour Change Practitioners,"Nguyen, D.; Jackson, M.","Digital technologies are becoming a more common part of behaviour change initiatives and campaigns. However, digital solutions can themselves present risks and challenges. In this chapter, we draw on the concept of technological solutionism to consider issues and shortcomings for behaviour change campaigns. We use the case of Florence, the World Health Organization’s “virtual health worker” who is designed to help people quit smoking, to spotlight how technologies operationalise social issues; the risk of embedded biases within technological solutions; and assumptions about digital access. While Florence is very efficient and always available, the experience overlooks some of the inherently “human” aspects of tobacco cessation, even if they are non-rational or time-consuming. The chapter encourages behaviour change practitioners to think critically about technologically enabled solutions and to be mindful of issues that can be embedded within them. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co..",2023,,BEYOND THE DARK ARTS: Advancing Marketing and Communication Theory and Practice,,,79-95,,10.1142/9789811276064_0005,,#5394,Nguyen 2023,,,0
IoT in medical diagnosis: detecting excretory functional disorders for Older adults via bathroom activity change using unobtrusive IoT technology,"Abdulrazak, B.; Mostafa Ahmed, H.; Aloulou, H.; Mokhtari, M.; Blanchet, F.G.","The Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are promising technologies that can help make the health system more efficient, which concurrently can be particularly useful to help maintain a high quality of life for older adults, especially in light of healthcare staff shortage. Many health issues are challenging to manage both by healthcare staff and policymakers. They have a negative impact on older adults and their families and are an economic burden to societies around the world. This situation is particularly critical for older adults, a population highly vulnerable to diseases that needs more consideration and care. It is, therefore, crucial to improve diagnostic and management as well as proposed prevention strategies to enhance the health and quality of life of older adults. In this study, we focus on detecting symptoms in early stages of diseases to prevent the deterioration of older adults' health and avoid complications. We focus on digestive and urinary system disorders [mainly the Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)] that are known to affect older adult populations and that are detrimental to their health and quality of life. Our proposed approach relies on unobtrusive IoT and change point detections algorithms to help follow older adults' health status daily. The approach monitors long-term behavior changes and detects possible changes in older adults' behavior suggesting early onsets or symptoms of IBS and UTI. We validated our approach with medical staff reports and IoT data collected in the residence of 16 different older adults during periods ranging from several months to a few years. Results are showing that our proposed approach can detect changes associated to symptoms of UTI and IBS, which were confirmed with observations and testimonies from the medical staff.

"Don’t Raise Your Voice, Improve Your Argument: Learning to Retrieve Convincing Arguments","Salamat, S.; Arabzadeh, N.; Bigdeli, A.; Seyedsalehi, S.; Zihayat, M.; Bagheri, E.","The Information Retrieval community has made strides in developing neural rankers, which have show strong retrieval effectiveness on large-scale gold standard datasets. The focus of existing neural rankers has primarily been on measuring the relevance of a document or passage to the user query. However, other considerations such as the convincingness of the content are not taken into account when retrieving content. We present a large gold standard dataset, referred to as CoRe, which focuses on enabling researchers to explore the integration of the concepts of convincingness and relevance to allow for the retrieval of relevant yet persuasive content. Through extensive experiments on this dataset, we report that there is a close association between convincingness and relevance that can have practical value in how convincing content are presented and retrieved in practice. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13981 LNCS,,589-598,,10.1007/978-3-031-28238-6_50,,#5396,Salamat 2023,,,0
Predicting Disengagement to Better Support Outcomes in a Web-Based Weight Loss Program Using Machine Learning Models: Cross-Sectional Study,"Brankovic, A.; Hendrie, G.A.; Baird, D.L.; Khanna, S.","Background: Engagement is key to interventions that achieve successful behavior change and improvements in health. There is limited literature on the application of predictive machine learning (ML) models to data from commercially available weight loss programs to predict disengagement. Such data could help participants achieve their goals. Objective: This study aimed to use explainable ML to predict the risk of member disengagement week by week over 12 weeks on a commercially available web-based weight loss program. Methods: Data were available from 59,686 adults who participated in the weight loss program between October 2014 and September 2019. Data included year of birth, sex, height, weight, motivation to join the program, use statistics (eg, weight entries, entries into the food diary, views of the menu, and program content), program type, and weight loss. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and logistic regression with L1 regularization models were developed and validated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. In addition, temporal validation was performed on a test cohort of 16,947 members who participated in the program between April 2018 and September 2019, and the remaining data were used for model development. Shapley values were used to identify globally relevant features and explain individual predictions. Results: The average age of the participants was 49.60 (SD 12.54) years, the average starting BMI was 32.43 (SD 6.19), and 81.46% (39,594/48,604) of the participants were female. The class distributions (active and inactive members) changed from 39,369 and 9235 in week 2 to 31,602 and 17,002 in week 12, respectively. With 10-fold-cross-validation, extreme gradient boosting models had the best predictive performance, which ranged from 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.85) to 0.93 (95% CI 0.93-0.93) for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and from 0.57 (95% CI 0.56-0.58) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.95-0.96) for area under the precision-recall curve (across 12 weeks of the program). They also presented a good calibration. Results obtained with temporal validation ranged from 0.51 to 0.95 for area under a precision-recall curve and 0.84 to 0.93 for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the 12 weeks. There was a considerable improvement in area under a precision-recall curve of 20% in week 3 of the program. On the basis of the computed Shapley values, the most important features for predicting disengagement in the following week were those related to the total activity on the platform and entering a weight in the previous weeks. Conclusions: This study showed the potential of applying ML predictive algorithms to help predict and understand participants’ disengagement with a web-based weight loss program. Given the association between engagement and health outcomes, these findings can prove valuable in providing better support to individuals to enhance their engagement and potentially achieve greater weight loss. ©Aida Brankovic, Gilly A Hendrie, Danielle L Baird, Sankalp Khanna.",2023,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,25,,,,10.2196/43633,,#5397,Brankovic 2023,,,0
Predicting online participation and adoption of autism unproven interventions: a case study of dietary interventions,"Ni, Z.; Qian, Y.; Li, H.; Mao, J.; Ma, F.","Family caregivers of autistic children are susceptible to unconfirmed fads and false claims regarding to the efficacy of unproven interventions. This study aims to predict family caregivers’ participation and adoption of unproven interventions in online communities. Based on the Diffusion of Innovations theory, we first divided the family caregivers’ adoption process into five stages: awareness, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Social network analysis and natural language processing methods were subsequently utilised to characterise personal, environmental, and behavioural factors for predicting the formation of last three stage. The results indicated promising evidence for the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting family caregivers’ decision (AUC = 0.823), implementation (AUC = 0.887), and confirmation (AUC = 0.921). Furthermore, the results showed that factors such as social interaction, social persuasion, and modelling significantly contributed to family caregivers’ online community participation and facilitated the adoption process of unproven interventions. Family caregivers with stronger negative emotions expressed were more likely to adopt unproven interventions and recommend these interventions to other community members, thereby accelerating the diffusion of these interventions. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Behaviour and Information Technology,,,,,10.1080/0144929X.2023.2284241,,#5398,Ni 2023,,,0

Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and further digital exercise intervention among inactive British adolescents in secondary schools: a qualitative study with physical education teachers,"Moore, R.; Edmondson, L.; Gregory, M.; Griffiths, K.; Freeman, E.","Background: Previous studies indicated that physical education programs in schools were unsuccessful to ameliorate physical activity (PA) behaviors among adolescents. This study investigated PE teachers’ perceptions of barriers and facilitators to PA and further digital exercise interventions among inactive British adolescents in secondary schools based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model, the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW), and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Method: A qualitative study was conducted among 156 PE teachers in England. deductive thematic analysis approach was applied to analyze data. Results: A comprehensive perception of PE teachers revealed 21 barriers to PA among inactive adolescents in secondary schools. The study findings show that barriers exist across all categories of the COM-B model in physical opportunity (7), reflective motivation (5), social opportunity (4), psychological capability (4) and physical capability (1). The majority of these barriers were reported in previous studies as being barriers to PA from the perspective of children and adolescents. This shows that the findings are consistent with the views of children and adolescents that participated in these studies. Particular salient barriers for inactive adolescents were reported and greater insight into their experiences was highlighted. The study reported the main sources of behavior, intervention functions, policy functions, and behavior change tools that can be used for future behavior change interventions to support inactive adolescents. Conclusion: The study recommends using its findings to design interventions for inactive adolescents to achieve recommended levels of physical activity (PA). The study’s comprehensive approach and evidence-based solutions provide extensive reference points for future intervention design, informing policy and contributing to enhancing support for inactive adolescents. Further development of digital exercise interventions, including conversational artificial intelligence (AI), is suggested to engage adolescents at scale and provide personalized support to overcome multiple barriers to PA.

"An omni-channel, outcomes-focused approach to scale digital health interventions in resource-limited populations: a case study","Hazra-Ganju, A.; Dlima, S.D.; Menezes, S.R.; Ganju, A.; Mer, A.","Populations in resource-limited communities have low health awareness, low financial literacy levels, and inadequate access to primary healthcare, leading to low adoption of preventive health behaviours, low healthcare-seeking behaviours, and poor health outcomes. Healthcare providers have limited reach and insights, limiting their ability to design relevant products for resource limited settings. Our primary preventive health intervention, called the Saathealth family health interventions, is a scaled digital offering that aims to improve knowledge levels on various health topics, nudge positive behaviour changes, and drive improved health outcomes. This case study presents our learnings and best practices in scaling these digital health interventions in resource-limited settings and maximising their impact. We scaled the Saathealth interventions to cumulatively reach >10 million users across India using a multi-pronged approach: (1) ensuring localization and cultural relevance of the health content delivered through user research; (2) disseminating content using omni-channel approaches, which involved using diverse content types and multiple digital platforms; (3) using iterative product features such as gamification and artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) predictive models; (4) using real-time analytics to adapt the user's digital experience by using interactive content to drive them towards products and services and (5) experiments with sustainability models to yield some early successes. The Saathealth family health mobile app had >25,000 downloads and the intervention reached >873,000 users in India every month through the mobile app, Facebook, and Instagram combined, from the time period of February 2022 to January 2023. We repeatedly observed videos and quizzes to be the most popular content types across all digital channels being used. Our AI-based predictive models helped improve user retention and content consumption, contributing to the sustainability of the mobile apps. In addition to reaching a high number of users across India, our scaling strategies contributed to deepened engagement and improved health-seeking behaviour. We hope these strategies help guide the sustainable and impactful scaling of mobile health interventions in other resource-limited settings. 2023 Hazra-Ganju, Dlima, Menezes, Ganju and Mer.",2023,,Frontiers in Digital Health,5,,,,10.3389/fdgth.2023.1007687,,#5401,Hazra-Ganju 2023,,,0
Authentically Fake? How Consumers Respond to the Influence of Virtual Influencers,"Lou, C.; Kiew, S.T.J.; Chen, T.; Lee, T.Y.M.; Ong, J.E.C.; Phua, Z.","Artificially created characters–virtual influencers–amass millions of followers on social media and affect digital natives’ engagement and decisionmaking in remarkable ways. Guided by the Uses and Gratification (U&G) approach and the Uncanny Valley Theory, this study seeks to understand this phenomenon. By looking into followers’ engagement with virtual influencers, this study identifies and conceptualizes six primary motivations–namely, novelty, information, entertainment, surveillance, esthetics, and integration and social interaction. Furthermore, we found that most followers perceive virtual influencers as uncanny and authentically fake. However, followers also express acceptance of their staged fabrication where curated flaws and self-justification have been found to mitigate the effect of the uncanny valley. Virtual influencers are considered effective in building brand image and boosting brand awareness, but lack the persuasive ability to incite purchase intention due to a lack of authenticity, a low similarity to followers, and their weak parasocial relations with followers. These findings advance the extant literature on U&G, influencer advertising, and virtual influencers in the era of artificial intelligence; provide insights into the mitigating factors of the uncanny valley; and yield theoretical and practical implications for the efficacy of virtual influencers in advertising campaigns. © Copyright © 2022, American Academy of Advertising.",2023,,Journal of Advertising,52,4,540-557,,10.1080/00913367.2022.2149641,,#5402,Lou 2023,,,0
Persuasive Technology and computational manipulation: hypernudging out of mental self-determination,"Faraoni, S.","Artificial Intelligence, unperceived, can acquire the user's data, find connections not visible by a human being, profile the users, and aim at persuading them, resulting in Persuasive Technology (PT). During the persuasive process, PT can use manipulation, finding and using routes to affect System 1, the primordial brain of individuals, in the absence of their awareness, undermining their decision-making processes. Multiple international and European bodies recognized that AI systems could use manipulation at an unprecedented degree via second-generation dark patterns such as the hypernudge and that computational manipulation constitutes a risk for autonomy and different, overlapping, fundamental rights such as privacy, informational self-determination and freedom of thought. However, there is a lack of shared ideas regarding which fundamental rights are violated by computational manipulation and which fundamental rights can protect individuals against it. The right to be let alone and the right to hold and express a thought differ from the right to create a thought, being in control of the decision-making process and free from cognitive interferences operated by computational manipulation. Therefore, this paper argues in favor of recognizing a newly emerged fundamental right, the right to mental self-determination, tailored to the unprecedented abilities of AI-driven manipulative technologies.

The Psychological Effects of AI-Assisted Programming on Students and Professionals,"Valovy, M.; Buchalcevova, A.","Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become integral to the coding workflow, facilitating productivity through auto-completion, code suggestions, and chat dialogues. More than ever, the psychological relationship between software engineers and AI partners requires further exploration, mirroring the need to understand the psychological aspects of pilot-navigator roles these tools partly simulate, as highlighted in earlier studies. [Goal] The presented research aims to investigate the programmer behavior change and psychological effects of AI-Assisted programming on professionals and undergraduates. [Methods] The authors performed a series of seven experimental programming sessions on the undergraduate student sample, subjecting them to programming in solo, pair, and AI-Assisted settings. Following the experimental sessions, five semi-structured interviews were conducted with the experimental participants from the academic realm and another five with experienced users of AI programming tools from the professional realm. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis in an essentialist way, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the participants' experiences, feelings, and attitudes toward AI-Assisted programming. [Results] A total of ten themes were identified, half shared across the two realms, with 51 constituent codes selected from the professional and 35 from the student interview transcripts. The realm-Agnostic themes were: ""Effectance"", ""Intrinsic Motivation"", ""Perceived AI Personality"", ""Dynamics of Human and AI Pairing,""and ""Paradigm Shifts"". The realm-specific themes included: ""Personal Growth and Development"", ""Prospects"", ""Ethical Considerations"", ""Safety"", and ""Effects on Learning Processes"". [Conclusion] The presented research illuminates the profound potential of using AI as a programming partner in simulated pilot-navigator roles in both professional and academic realms. It underscores the importance of understanding its effects on psychological well-being and human experience.

Explainable Tensor Multi-Task Ensemble Learning Based on Brain Structure Variation for Alzheimer's Disease Dynamic Prediction,"Zhang, Y.; Liu, T.; Lanfranchi, V.; Yang, P.","Machine learning approaches for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression can substantially assist researchers and clinicians in developing effective AD preventive and treatment strategies. This study proposes a novel machine learning algorithm to predict the AD progression utilising a multi-task ensemble learning approach. Specifically, we present a novel tensor multi-task learning (MTL) algorithm based on similarity measurement of spatio-temporal variability of brain biomarkers to model AD progression. In this model, the prediction of each patient sample in the tensor is set as one task, where all tasks share a set of latent factors obtained through tensor decomposition. Furthermore, as subjects have continuous records of brain biomarker testing, the model is extended to ensemble the subjects' temporally continuous prediction results utilising a gradient boosting kernel to find more accurate predictions. We have conducted extensive experiments utilising data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and model. Results demonstrate that the proposed model have superior accuracy and stability in predicting AD progression compared to benchmarks and state-of-the-art multi-task regression methods in terms of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire and The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) cognitive scores. Brain biomarker correlation information can be utilised to identify variations in individual brain structures and the model can be utilised to effectively predict the progression of AD with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores of AD patients at different stages.  © 2013 IEEE.",2023,,IEEE Journal of Translational Engineering in Health and Medicine,11,,01-Dec,,10.1109/JTEHM.2022.3219775,,#5405,Zhang 2023,,,0
A Proof-of-Concept Implementation Based on the Framework of AI-Enabled Proactive mHealth: Health Promotion with Motivation,"Sulaiman, M.; Håkansson, A.; Karlsen, R.","Digital health with mHealth contributes to health promotion by empowering the user with a holistic view of their health. Proactive mHealth is to predict and prevent a situation beforehand, promptly. Most health decisions are taken by the user pervasively. They have a short or long-term impact. Being proactive requires support as ubiquitous decision-making is prone to sudden changes. Changes in users’ internal and contextual states require adaptive systems with timeliness. Personalized health information needs analysis to support user-level decision-making. The goal is to automate processes and augment healthy behaviour. Data from wearables, together with the context, requires automated decision-making with AI modelling, for predicting intervention values. Prediction and prevention mechanism in implementation requires timely interventions, triggered with a supportive action. The health information (wearables + context) can provide information about the states (current, future, and goal). AI-enabled proactive mHealth framework accentuates abstraction by presenting modules with rules of user-level decision-making, tools for automated decision-making, design with P5 principles, and the architecture of Just-in-time adaptive interventions. In this paper, a proof-of-concept (POC) for health promotion with physical activity is implemented based on the framework. The goal is to promote health with motivation. The paper also categorizes intervention with type, properties, and principles. Components of intervention and behaviour change are also listed. POC includes parameters of context and user profile. The paper provides a step-by-step approach to implementing the system on the framework, from input/output mapping to modelling.

DEMAND SENSING USING CATBOOST MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM TO REDUCE RISK AND MAINTAIN CLEAN ENVIRONMENT,"Venkatachalam, G.; Shanthini, J.; Sivasubramanian, R.","Supply Chain Management is a quintessential task of every firm as it is the core of the business. A business is driven entirely by customer behaviour, change in seasonal demand and how the customer expands or shrunk their purchasing power. The stock available in the inventory should also be managed based on the changing demand, if under stocked or overstocked leads to huge losses to the business and they will also lose their market share. This work focuses on the ongoing problem in the supply chain domain, which is the Bullwhip Effect, wherein a slight change in the customer demand has a significant impact in the inventory leading to stocking more than required. Many methodologies have been incorporated to reduce the effect of Bull whip. The advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence has rendered effective to solve various real time problems. The machine learning algorithms can be fine-tuned to predict the seasonal demand in the market in prior based on the customer behaviour.

The Effect of Balancing Methods on Model Behavior in Imbalanced Classification Problems,"Stańdo, A.; Cavus, M.; Biecek, P.","Imbalanced data poses a significant challenge in classification as model performance is affected by insufficient learning from minority classes. Balancing methods are often used to address this problem. However, such techniques can lead to problems such as overfitting or loss of information. This study addresses a more challenging aspect of balancing methods - their impact on model behavior. To capture these changes, Explainable Artificial Intelligence tools are used to compare models trained on datasets before and after balancing. In addition to the Variable Importance method, this study uses Partial Dependence and Accumulated Local Effects profiles. Real and simulated datasets are tested, and an open-source Python package edgaro is developed to facilitate this analysis. The results obtained show significant changes in model behavior due to balancing methods, which can lead to biased models toward a balanced distribution. These findings confirm that balancing analysis should go beyond model performance comparisons to achieve higher reliability of machine learning models. Therefore, we propose a new method performance gain plot for informed data balancing strategy to make an optimal selection of balancing method by analyzing the measure of change in model behavior versus performance gain. © 2023 A.

Evaluating the Acceptance of Enhanced Generative AI Services,"Ahmed, W.; Sentosa, I.; Hizam, S.M.; Mat, C.R.C.; Hernandez, M.S.","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a spectrum of generative AI services that promise to enhance various professional and personal tasks. This study aims to explore the factors influencing users' intentions to transition from basic to premium generative AI services, focusing on Performance Expectancy (PE), Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), Personal Innovativeness (PI), and Social Influence (SI). A survey of 193 individuals, primarily university students with an IT background, revealed that PE, TSE, and SI significantly affect the Behavioral Intention (BI) to adopt enhanced services, with SI being the most influential. Contrary to expectations, PI did not predict BI, indicating that innovation alone does not drive the adoption of advanced AI capabilities. The findings suggest that the practicality of AI tools, user confidence in their technical skills, and the persuasive power of social networks are pivotal in the decision-making process for upgrading AI services. This research contributes to the understanding of AI adoption patterns and provides insights for developers and marketers to tailor user experiences and educational initiatives that align with user needs and social dynamics. It also underscores the importance of addressing ethical considerations as AI continues to permeate various aspects of society.  © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,"Proceedings - 2023 International Conference on Data, Information and Computing Science, CDICS 2023",,,73-77,,10.1109/CDICS61497.2023.00022,,#5414,Ahmed 2023,,,0
A System Design for Automated Tailoring of Behavior Change Recommendations Using Time-Series Clustering of Energy Consumption Data.,"Schrammel, J.; Diamond, L.; Fröhlich, P.","In this paper we describe our approach to address the challenges of tailoring and personalizing behavior change recommendations based on energy consumption data collected through smart meters and energy monitoring technologies. The approach uses time-series clustering techniques with dynamic time warping to group daily energy consumption curves into similar clusters, and then provides personalized recommendations for shifting energy behavior to each individual based on their predicted consumption pattern, the day-ahead energy prices and the resulting savings opportunities. The paper presents the methodology and discusses the suitability of this approach for improving traditional energy feedback and demand response interventions, and provides an outlook on the possibilities of artificial intelligence methods to further improve the concept. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2023,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3474,,,,,,#5415,Schrammel 2023,,,0

The comprehensive unified paradigm for business model innovation,"Kim, I.-H.S.","Recognising that there is a growing trend of misfits between a firm’s technology/routines and market customer needs due to the exponential technological change and linear-type needs evolution in the age of AI (artificial intelligence), this paper aims at developing a model/theory/paradigm that guarantees to attain the targeted outcome. It firstly draws the necessary conditions of BM/BMI from the natures of AI regime according to which literature review on BM/BMI is done and selects direct causal mechanisms of profit (DCMP) & business model schema (BMS) as the theoretical foundation, classifies all probable circumstances into several contingency settings in terms of environmental changes, technological change, needs evolution and bargaining power, specifies strategic indicators including normative business model (NBM) by contingency setting based on DCMP & BMS, builds the comprehensive unified paradigm (CUP) that introduces new strategising logic ‘Seek NBM first & then Get-to-It’ through new decision-making mode ‘adaptising’ with practical rationality, discusses about some vague/dubious notions in strategising, and concludes that CUP works as the general theory of BMI for it holds the universal and contingency rules for BMI simultaneously, asserting that when it comes to BM/BMI, there is nothing more robust, persuasive and practical than the general theory of BMI, CUP. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",2023,,Technology Analysis and Strategic Management,35,11,1497-1518,,10.1080/09537325.2021.2011190,,#5417,Kim 2023,,,0
Ethical considerations for the use of consumer wearables in health research,"Sui, A.; Sui, W.; Liu, S.; Rhodes, R.","Background: The UN's High Commissioner's request for a moratorium on the use and adoption of specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that pose serious risk to human rights, this commentary explores the current environment and future implications of using third-party wearable technologies in research for participants’ data privacy and data security. While wearables have been identified as tools for improving users’ physical and mental health and wellbeing by providing users with more personalized data and tailored interventions, the use of this technology does not come without concern. Objective: Primarily, as researchers, we are concerned with enmeshment of corporate and research interests and what this can mean for participant data. Methods: By drawing on specific sections of the UN Report ‘The right to privacy in the digital age’, we discuss the conflicts between corporate and research agendas and point out the current and future implications of the involvement of third-party companies for participant data privacy, data security and data usage. Finally, we offer suggestions for researchers and third-party wearable developers for conducting ethical and transparent research with wearable tech.

To Tell or Not to Tell: The Effects of Disclosing Deepfake Video on US and Indian Consumers’ Purchase Intention,"Powers, G.; Johnson, J.P.; Killian, G.","Marketing communicators are utilizing artificial intelligence–driven technology to create seemingly real communications featuring synthetic humans. This research aims to determine the consequences of disclosing the use of synthetic, or “deepfake,” video avatars in marketing. Based on schema congruity theory and the persuasion knowledge model, this research investigates whether disclosing an avatar as synthetic impacts consumers’ perceptions of source credibility and subsequent purchase intention. It also examines the role of social cynicism on consumers’ perceptions of source credibility and purchase intention. This study employs a posttest only, control group experimental design (n = 318) with participants from the United States (low social cynicism) and India (high social cynicism). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis, findings indicate that disclosure of a synthetic avatar negatively impacted purchase intention due to reduced perceptions of source trustworthiness. Results show that for women and higher-income individuals, disclosure has a greater negative effect on purchase intention. However, there was no significant support for social cynicism moderating the mediation effects of the three dimensions of source credibility on purchase intention.

ADHERENCE TO TREATMENT – REVIEWING METHODS OF ASSESSMENT AND IMPROVEMENT,"Rusu, R.-N.; Ababei, D.C.; Stanciu, G.D.; Neamțu, M.; Macadan, I.; Lazăr, C.I.A.; Bild, V.","According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adherence is considered “the extent to which a person’s behaviour – taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider”. Adherence rates average 50% in countries such as the United States, exerting important pressure on health systems. Factors which influence medication adherence can be related to the patient, the clinical conditions, therapy, socioeconomic factors and the healthcare system. Methods of adherence assessment are direct and indirect. While direct methods measure a certain drug or metabolite in body fluids of patients, indirect methods refer to self-report measures, pill count, electronic monitoring devices, electronic databases.

Developments in respiratory self-management interventions over the last two decades,"Effing, T.W.","This paper describes developments in the fields of asthma and COPD self-management interventions (SMIs) over the last two decades and discusses future directions. Evidence around SMIs has exponentially grown. Efficacy on group level is convincing and both asthma and COPD SMIs are currently recommended by respiratory guidelines. Core components of asthma SMIs are defined as education, action plans, and regular review, with some discussion about self-monitoring. Exacerbation action plans are defined as an integral part of COPD management. Patient’s adherence to SMI’s is however inadequate and significantly reducing the intervention’s impact. Adherence could be improved by tailoring of SMIs to patients’ needs, health beliefs, and capabilities; the use of shared decision making; and optimising the communication between patients and health care providers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health innovations have rapidly been introduced and expanded. Digital technology use may increase efficiency, flexibility, and efficacy of SMIs. Furthermore, artificial intelligence can be used to e.g., predict exacerbations in action plans. Research around digital health innovations to ensure evidence-based practice is of utmost importance. Current implementation of respiratory SMIs is not satisfactory. Implementation research should be used to generate further insights, with cost-effectiveness, policy (makers), and funding being significant determinants. © The Author(s) 2023.",2023,,Chronic Respiratory Disease,20,,,,10.1177/14799731231221819,,#5422,Effing 2023,,,0
Using machine learning to extract information and predict outcomes from reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions in the Human Behaviour-Change Project,"West, R.; Bonin, F.; Thomas, J.; Wright, A.J.; Mac Aonghusa, P.; Gleize, M.; Hou, Y.; O'Mara-Eves, A.; Hastings, J.; Johnston, M.; Michie, S.","Background Using reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions as a test case, this study aimed to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) algorithms for extracting information from study reports and predicting outcomes as part of the Human Behaviour-Change Project. It is the first of two linked papers, with the second paper reporting on further development of a prediction system. Methods Researchers manually annotated 70 items of information (‘entities’) in 512 reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions covering intervention content and delivery, population, setting, outcome and study methodology using the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology. These entities were used to train ML algorithms to extract the information automatically. The information extraction ML algorithm involved a named-entity recognition system using the ‘FLAIR’ framework. The manually annotated intervention, population, setting and study entities were used to develop a deep-learning algorithm using multiple layers of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) components to predict smoking cessation outcomes. Results The F1 evaluation score, derived from the false positive and false negative rates (range 0–1), for the information extraction algorithm averaged 0.42 across different types of entity (SD=0.22, range 0.05–0.88) compared with an average human annotator’s score of 0.75 (SD=0.15, range 0.38–1.00). The algorithm for assigning entities to study arms (e.g., intervention or control) was not successful. This initial ML outcome prediction algorithm did not outperform prediction based just on the mean outcome value or a linear regression model. Conclusions While some success was achieved in using ML to extract information from reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions, we identified major challenges that could be addressed by greater standardisation in the way that studies are reported. Outcome prediction from smoking cessation studies may benefit from development of novel algorithms, e.g., using ontological information to inform ML (as reported in the linked paper  3).

The development of methods to evaluate experimental animal behavior using images,"Sakamoto, N.; Miyazaki, Y.; Kobayashi, K.; Minato, T.; Murata, T.","In life science and medicine, we have been conducting research using laboratory animals such as mice, rats and monkeys. However, it is impossible for humans to fully understand the feelings and conditions of experimental animals with whom we cannot communicate. In particular, investigators have recently focused on brain function and have created animal models to mimic human depression, pain, and dementia through behavioral tests such as tail suspension and mazes. These methods allow for some evaluation of the animal’s condition. However, we cannot detect trivial behavioral changes that reflect the state of mind and body of the animals reproducibly and objectively. With improvements in imaging and information processing technology, it is now possible to photograph animals for extended periods of time and perform sophisticated analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) can also perform learning and inference, or intelligent work (machine learning), for extended periods of time by processing higher levels of information and can find interpretations that humans are unaware of. To bring innovation to life science research using animals, it is necessary to integrate and utilize these technologies to digitize and extensively and deeply evaluate biological information and emotions of experimental animals. We have been developing some basic technologies for experimental animals by applying image analysis technology, AI, and mathematical analysis. In this review, we introduce the technologies we have developed, including the latest reports. © 2023, Japanese Pharmacological Society.

Towards Persuasive AI for People with Olfactory Dysfunction,"Parvin, P.; Giannikou, E.; Zhang, C.; Boesveldt, S.; Hauptmann, H.","Olfactory dysfunction is a complication arising from various factors, including neurodegenerative disorders, aging, and viral infections like COVID-19. It can adversely affect appetite and food enjoyment, potentially leading to malnutrition. Food tailored to the sensory preferences of such patients can be an effective intervention. However, the utilization of artificial intelligence for suggesting suitable food and persuasive designs for presenting such suggestions has yet to be researched in this context. To address this gap, we conducted a co-creation workshop with patients and multidisciplinary experts to identify food-related goals and challenges faced in daily contexts. The emerging solutions are personalized food recommendations, flavor enhancements, and food sensory descriptors. However, the current databases and models are not suitable for producing these solutions. This is due to the complex feature set required to produce such recommendations. Moreover, such a system needs to incorporate factors such as health, enjoyment, and practical limitations to provide adequate support. Therefore, we outline a research roadmap toward providing personalized and persuasive artificial intelligence for people with olfactory dysfunction. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",2023,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,3474,,,,,,#5426,Parvin 2023,,,0
Relatedness for Moral Courage: Game Experience Dimensions as Persuasive Strategies for Moral Courage in Contrast to Other Facets of Altruistic Behavior,"Himmelsbach, J.; Hochleitner, W.; Schneider, A.; Schwarz, S.; Sellitsch, D.; Tscheligi, M.","Moral courage has rarely been the focus of persuasive technologies. So far, few insights on persuasive strategies for moral courage exist, which mainly target a social psychological perspective but do not address game-based specifics. Against this background, we conducted an experimental study to identify game-related persuasive strategies. We show that the players’ experience of relatedness, i.e., social belonging and interactions with fictitious characters or other players, is key for enabling courageous altruistic behavior change, namely moral and civil courage, but not other forms of altruistic behavior, such as help-giving. We present large to medium effect sizes with an increase in the relationship between moral courage and relatedness over time. We conclude that persuasive technologies for moral courage require specific persuasion strategies. By addressing relatedness, users can negotiate social norms in a reciprocal relationship with the technology, and future persuasive games could contribute to increased moral courage and, thus, social justice. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13832 LNCS,,322-336,,10.1007/978-3-031-30933-5_21,,#5427,Himmelsbach 2023,,,0

Tackling the Myriads of Collusion Scams on YouTube Comments of Cryptocurrency Videos,"Shahriar, S.; Mukherjee, A.","Despite repeated measures, YouTube's comment section has been a fertile ground for scammers. With the growth of the cryptocurrency market and obscurity around it, a new form of scam, namely ""Collusion Scam"" has emerged as a dominant force within YouTube's comment space. Unlike typical scams and spams, collusion scams employ a cunning persuasion strategy, using the facade of genuine social interactions within comment threads to create an aura of trust and success to entrap innocent users. In this research, we collect 1,174 such collusion scam threads and perform a detailed analysis, which is tailored towards the successful detection of these scams. We find that utilization of the collusion dynamics can provide an accuracy of 96.67% and an F1-score of 93.04%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictive power of metadata associated with these threads and user channels, which act as compelling indicators of collusion scams. Finally, we show that modern LLM, like chatGPT, can effectively detect collusion scams without the need for any training. © 2023 Incoma Ltd.

Then, we discuss the potential of artificial neural networks on the sensed data for disease monitoring and management. Next, we describe risk factors, causes, pathophysiological processes, and severity of chronic diseases. This is followed with a careful review of how we can use the sensed chronic disease biomarkers and clinical symptoms as features for the machine learning algorithms.

ProHealth eCoach: user-centered design and development of an eCoach app to promote healthy lifestyle with personalized activity recommendations,"Chatterjee, A.; Prinz, A.; Gerdes, M.; Martinez, S.; Pahari, N.; Meena, Y.K.","Background: Regular physical activity (PA), healthy habits, and an appropriate diet are recommended guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process. Methods: We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user’s context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals. Results: The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user’s requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the “Google Material Design” guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users. Conclusions: The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU). © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,,BMC Health Services Research,22,1,,,10.1186/s12913-022-08441-0,,#5431,Chatterjee 2022,,,0
Do Humans Prefer Debiased AI Algorithms? A Case Study in Career Recommendation,"Wang, C.; Wang, K.; Bian, A.; Islam, R.; Keya, K.N.; Foulds, J.; Pan, S.","Currently, there is a surge of interest in fair Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research which aims to mitigate discriminatory bias in AI algorithms, e.g. along lines of gender, age, and race. While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when human- fair-AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer and more accurate college major recommendations. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that the perceived gender disparity associated with a college major is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, our results demonstrate we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. They also highlight the urgent need to extend the current scope of fair AI research from narrowly focusing on debiasing AI algorithms to including new persuasion and bias explanation technologies in order to achieve intended societal impacts.  © 2022 ACM.",2022,,"International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, Proceedings IUI",,,134-147,,10.1145/3490099.3511108,,#5432,Wang 2022,,,0

Quantification of Mucosal Eosinophils for the Histopathologic Diagnosis of Eosinophilic Gastritis and Duodenitis: A Primer for Practicing Pathologists,"Turner, K.O.; Collins, M.H.; Walker, M.M.; Genta, R.M.","Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, specifically eosinophilic gastritis and duodenitis, are chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and elevated levels of activated eosinophils in the GI tract. Both clinical and endoscopic findings are nonspecific, no clinical or histopathologic diagnostic guidelines are published, and disease awareness is low, both among clinicians and amongst pathologists, who tend to overlook mild or moderate increases in the density of eosinophils in GI biopsy specimens. Yet, evaluating and, at times, counting eosinophils in GI biopsies may have important clinical implications: the numbers of tissue eosinophils correlate with clinical manifestations, can be used as determinants of effective management, and are used to assess the effects of treatment. A most persuasive argument for providing a count rather than a value judgment is that patients read reports, understand numbers, and use them to help to understand the course of their disease. The objective of this primer is to provide pathologists with the tools to incorporate a quantitative assessment of eosinophilia in the diagnosis of gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens and to develop a systematic approach to their evaluation, counting, and reporting. To achieve this aim, we present our general approach to the biopsy (where to count), followed by details on the characteristics of a countable eosinophil (what to count), and provide with a set of suggestions on the counting methods (how to count). We conclude with suggestions on how to report GI tissue eosinophilia in a manner that alerts clinicians and prompts pertinent management steps.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Persuasion in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Theories and Complications of AI-Based Persuasion,"Dehnert, M.; Mongeau, P.A.","Artificial intelligence (AI) has profound implications for both communication and persuasion. We consider how AI complicates and promotes rethinking of persuasion theory and research. We define AI-based persuasion as a symbolic process in which a communicative-AI entity generates, augments, or modifies a message-designed to convince people to shape, reinforce, or change their responses-that is transmitted to human receivers. We review theoretical perspectives useful for studying AI-based persuasion-the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model, and the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion-to explicate how differences in AI complicate persuasion in two ways. First, thin AI exhibits few (if any) machinic (i.e., AI) cues, social cues might be available, and communication is limited and indirect. Second, thick AI exhibits ample machinic and social cues, AI presence is obvious, and communication is direct and interactive.

Continuous Glucose Monitoring: An Opportunity for Population-Based Diabetes Management,"Skoufalos, A.; Thomas, R.; Patel, R.; Mei, C.; Clarke, J.L.","The increasing prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in the United States poses a serious threat to the health of the population. Closely associated with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease, a diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes carries with it life-altering demands. Critically important among these is the requirement for frequent glucose level checks - typically performed with blood obtained from a fingerstick. Innovative real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) technology makes it possible for patients and their clinicians to receive continuous glucose level measurements around the clock without finger sticks. Accruing evidence shows that rtCGM is an effective tool for patients and their clinicians in managing diabetes (ie, maintaining glucose levels within the recommended target range) and in understanding how lifestyle behaviors directly influence glucose levels. In recent years, a number of large payer organizations (eg, private health insurers, employers) have incorporated rtCGM in their diabetes management programs as a means of addressing the dual challenge of achieving/maintaining control of glucose levels and preventing or delaying the onset of complications. Programmatic integrated approaches have been used successfully and cost-effectively for managing other chronic conditions. Incorporating rtCGM in similar integrated approaches in diabetes management may be of value in improving quality outcomes and reducing costs on a population level. The evidence supports broader adoption and continued study to evaluate models that incorporate the use of rtCGM.

Bayesian Persuasion in Sequential Decision-Making,"Gan, J.; Majumdar, R.; Radanovic, G.; Singla, A.","We study a dynamic model of Bayesian persuasion in sequential decision-making settings. An informed principal observes an external parameter of the world and advises an uninformed agent about actions to take over time. The agent takes actions in each time step based on the current state, the principal's advice/signal, and beliefs about the external parameter. The action of the agent updates the state according to a stochastic process. The model arises naturally in many applications, e.g., an app (the principal) can advice the user (the agent) on possible choices between actions based on additional real-time information the app has. We study the problem of designing a signaling strategy from the principal's point of view. We show that the principal has an optimal strategy against a myopic agent, who only optimizes their rewards locally, and the optimal strategy can be computed in polynomial time. In contrast, it is NP-hard to approximate an optimal policy against a far-sighted agent. Further, if the principal has the power to threaten the agent by not providing future signals, then we can efficiently compute a threat-based strategy. This strategy guarantees the principal's payoff as if playing against an agent who is far-sighted but myopic to future signals. © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Addressing the Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools in the Design of Visual Persuasive Discourses,"Ruiz-Arellano, A.E.; Mejía-Medina, D.A.; Castillo-Topete, V.H.; Fong-Mata, M.B.; Hernández-Torres, E.L.; Rodríguez-Valenzuela, P.; Berra-Ruiz, E.","Artificial intelligence (AI) systems to generate images from natural language are a game changer in graphic design. However, in visual persuasive communication, the image is not just a drawing, but is the message itself. It arises from the need for understanding how AI systems could be adopted in the design of visual communication. Thus, this article presents a model that describes the theoretical–methodological factors present in the design of persuasive visual discourses, which arises from a qualitative study with an analysis of grounded theory from the opinion of experts in the essential areas for visual communication.

An online advertising intervention to increase adherence to stay-at-home-orders during the COVID-19 pandemic: An efficacy trial monitoring individual-level mobility data,"Garett, R.R.; Yang, J.; Zhang, Q.; Young, S.D.","The COVID-19 pandemic has led public health departments to issue several orders and recommendations to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. However, for various reasons, including lack of ability to sufficiently monitor and influence behavior change, adherence to these health orders and recommendations has been suboptimal. Starting April 29, 2020, during the initial stay-at-home orders issued by various state governors, we conducted an intervention that sent online website and mobile application advertisements to people's mobile phones to encourage them to adhere to stay-at-home orders. Adherence to stay-at-home orders was monitored using individual-level cell phone mobility data, from April 29, 2020 through May 10, 2020. Mobile devices across 5 regions in the United States were randomly-assigned to either receive advertisements from our research team advising them to stay at home to stay safe (intervention group) or standard advertisements from other advertisers (control group). Compared to control group devices that received only standard corporate advertisements (i.e., did not receive public health advertisements to stay at home), the (intervention group) devices that received public health advertisements to stay at home demonstrated objectively-measured increased adherence to stay at home (i.e., smaller radius of gyration, average travel distance, and larger stay-at-home ratios). Results suggest that 1) it is feasible to use mobility data to assess efficacy of an online advertising intervention, and 2) online advertisements are a potentially effective method for increasing adherence to government/public health stay-at-home orders. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,108,,,,10.1016/j.jag.2022.102752,,#5444,Garett 2022,,,0

MCTK: a Multi-modal Conversational Troubleshooting Kit for supporting users in web applications,"Abbo, G.A.; Crovari, P.; Pidò, S.; Pinoli, P.; Garzotto, F.","Conversational Interfaces for user assistance are becoming persuasive. Today, though, most chatbots are not integrated into the application in which they are placed, but only superimposed, with no communication between the conversational and the graphical interface. We propose Multi-modal Conversational Troubleshooting Kit (MCTK), a Python package to easily integrate a conversational agent for troubleshooting in web applications. MCTK is multi-modal: once the system recognizes the problem the user is encountering, the textual solution in the chat is coupled with visual hints in the GUI. On top of that, MCTK is easy to configure and offers separation of concerns: dialogue designers can work on the conversation without the necessity of modifying the code, and vice versa. © 2022 Owner/Author.",2022,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,,,10.1145/3531073.3534480,,#5448,Abbo 2022,,,0
The Role of AI Agents in Spreading and Detecting Fake Online Reviews: A Systematic Review: An Abstract,"Petrescu, M.; Ajjan, H.; Harrison, D.","Researchers have underlined the need for a better understanding of the variables that contribute to and undermine the process of fake reviews detection, to help business, government, and non-profit organizations design more effective strategies (Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; Xiao & Benbasat, 2011). The purpose of this paper is to offer a comprehensive literature review on the role that AI-based technology plays in the creation, diffusion, as well as detection of fake online consumer reviews, and to propose a theoretical framework for future research. There is a developing literature on digital deception detection based on artificially intelligent tools, including machine learning and automated deception classifiers in analyzing textual and contextual indicators of manipulation (Anderson & Simester, 2014; Munzel, 2015). In this context, artificial intelligence represents a resource to automate business processes in online targeting, engaging consumers, as well as gain insights from data, analyzing numbers, text, voice, faces, and images (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018; Grewal et al., 2020; Shankar, 2018; Wirth, 2018; Yadav & Pavlou, 2020). AI agents have the potential to be successfully employed by both consumers and marketers in the process of spreading and detecting deceptive reviews, through technologies like social bots and machine learning algorithms that can make the process of manipulation more effective but can also help in its detection. Drawing from the theoretical framework based on the Persuasion Knowledge Model (Campbell & Kirmani, 2000; DeCarlo, 2005; Friestad & Wright, 1994) and the sinister attribution error in consumer judgments (Kramer, 1998; Main et al., 2007), we are proposing a framework for future research that focuses on both the intervention of AI-agents in the fake review process, as well as the changing equilibrium in consumer and business outcomes as a result of fake review use. This framework synthesizes the process of diffusing fake online reviews and their impact on consumers and organizations. This paper represents the first attempt to provide an extensive and critical review on the topic of AI-based manipulation and detection. A systematic review of the literature helps us advance our current knowledge of online reviews in several impactful ways. (1) It helps us identify AI-agents manipulation and detection mechanisms applied to understand deceptive online reviews, (2) It allows us to shed light on the unique characteristics of online reviews that allow for its manipulation and detection, and (3) it gives the ability to study the inter-relationship of literature themes using PKM to propose a direction for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2023,,Developments in Marketing Science: Proceedings of the Academy of Marketing Science,,,333-334,,10.1007/978-3-031-24687-6_137,,#5449,Petrescu 2023,,,0
Machine Learning in Health Promotion and Behavioral Change: Scoping Review,"Goh, Y.S.; Yong, J.Q.Y.O.; Chee, B.Q.H.; Kuek, J.H.L.; Ho, C.S.H.","Background: Despite health behavioral change interventions targeting modifiable lifestyle factors underlying chronic diseases, dropouts and nonadherence of individuals have remained high. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) in recent years, alongside its ability to provide readily available personalized experience for users, holds much potential for success in health promotion and behavioral change interventions. Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing research on ML applications and harness their potential in health promotion and behavioral change interventions. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A total of 9 databases (the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Ovid, ProQuest, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched from inception to February 2021, without limits on the dates and types of publications. Studies were included in the review if they had incorporated ML in any health promotion or behavioral change interventions, had studied at least one group of participants, and had been published in English. Publication-related information (author, year, aim, and findings), area of health promotion, user data analyzed, type of ML used, challenges encountered, and future research were extracted from each study. Results: A total of 29 articles were included in this review. Three themes were generated, which are as follows: (1) enablers, which is the adoption of information technology for optimizing systemic operation; (2) challenges, which comprises the various hurdles and limitations presented in the articles; and (3) future directions, which explores prospective strategies in health promotion through ML. Conclusions: The challenges pertained to not only the time- and resource-consuming nature of ML-based applications, but also the burden on users for data input and the degree of personalization. Future works may consider designs that correspondingly mitigate these challenges in areas that receive limited attention, such as smoking and mental health. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Using AI predicted personality to enhance advertising effectiveness,"Shumanov, M.; Cooper, H.; Ewing, M.","Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: first to demonstrate the application of an algorithm using contextual data to ascertain consumer personality traits; and second to explore the factors impacting the relationship between personality traits and advertisement persuasiveness. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach that comprises two distinct yet complementary studies. The first uses quantitative methods and is based on a sample of 35,264 retail banking customers. Study 2 explores the findings that emerge from Study 1 using qualitative methods. Findings: This paper finds that matching consumer personality with congruent advertising messages can lead to more effective consumer persuasion for most personality types. For consumers who exhibit neurotic personality traits, ameliorating perceived risks during purchasing and providing cues for social acceptance and goal attainment are important factors for advertising effectiveness. These factors also had a positive impact on the purchasing behaviour of extroverted consumers. Research limitations/implications: This research focusses on understanding purchasing behaviour based on the most dominant personality trait. However, people are likely to exhibit a combination of most or even all of the Big Five personality traits. Practical implications: Building on advances in natural language processing, enabling the identification of personality from language, this study demonstrates the possibility of influencing consumer behaviour by matching machine inferred personality to congruent persuasive advertising. It is one of the few studies to use contextual instead of social media data to capture individual personality. Such data serves to capture an authentic rather than contrived persona. Further, the study identifies the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation of why some personality traits exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory. Originality/value: Although the idea that people are more likely to be responsive to advertising messages that are congruent with their personality type has already been successfully applied by advertising practitioners and documented by advertising scholars, this study extends existing research by identifying the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation why some personality traits may exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,,European Journal of Marketing,56,6,1590-1609,,10.1108/EJM-12-2019-0941,,#5452,Shumanov 2022,,,0
Overcoming customer innovation resistance to the sustainable adoption of chatbot services: A community-enterprise perspective in Thailand,"Kwangsawad, A.; Jattamart, A.","The primary goal of utilizing chatbots for customer service is to fulfill customer requests without requiring a conversation. However, the challenge to the sustainable adoption of innovations is overcoming the obstacles that prevent the innovation's spread. The current study examined factors including consumers' perceptions, barriers and perceived risks that influence consumers' intentions to continue utilizing chatbot services in community enterprise. Modeling integrates the innovation-decision process in Phase 1 (knowledge, persuasion, and decision) with the technology acceptance model (TAM), perceived convenience and information quality. We also consider technological anxiety and openness to experience as potential barriers to individual innovation. The research model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) from 401 users with no more than 6 months of community-enterprise chatbot experience. Key findings that perceived privacy and time risk directly affected attitudes and intentions toward using chatbots. Moreover, technological anxiety is a barrier that affects attitudes toward chatbot usage, while perceived information quality indirectly influences users to use chatbots continually. However, there was no correlation between openness to experience and attitudes toward the continued use of chatbots. The finding indicates that experienced chatbot users are concerned with privacy and time constraints. This study contributes significantly to knowledge of the impediments to the diffusion of sustainable innovations among community-enterprise entrepreneurs. © 2022 The Authors",2022,,Journal of Innovation and Knowledge,7,3,,,10.1016/j.jik.2022.100211,,#5453,Kwangsawad 2022,,,0
European Union's Green Smart Directive or How Resource-Conscious Smart Systems Saved the World,"Hassenzahl, M.; Dörrenbächer, J.; Laschke, M.; Sadeghian, S.","In the 2020s, the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change became unmistakable. Floods, storms, the mass extinction of flora and fauna, the threats of further pandemics, as well as Russia's war with Ukraine made it necessary for Europeans to act immediately. While the public was still wrangling about the best way to become more resource-conscious, in 2026 the European Union passed a directive that bound ""smart"", artificial-intelligence-infused technologies to the goal of reducing resource consumption by law - the Green Smart directive. The present paper traces the impact of Green Smart in three everyday domains: laundry, mobility, and gardening. It shows that Green Smart led to a ""decentering""of the human with beneficial effects on the planet as well as individual wellbeing. Upon release of the directive, smart systems immediately installed policies of CO2 avoidance and resource-saving, which had been discussed for centuries already, but had never actually been implemented. While this was accompanied by fierce debates about ""freedom""and the ""enslavement""of humanity by technology, in everyday life, the policies led to an almost instant reduction in resource consumption. New and adapted everyday practices appeared quickly, and many of them changed people's lives clearly for the better. In general, humanity's attitude toward technology changed profoundly. Instead of expecting technology to be a mere tool, always under the immediate control of people and to be used for whatever people saw fit, technology became understood as a powerful ""other"", with its own needs and goals - even if those were designed by humans themselves. Instead of using technology, people started to cooperate and negotiate with technology about better ways of living.  © 2022 ACM.",2022,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,,,10.1145/3546155.3547277,,#5454,Hassenzahl 2022,,,0

Promoting Physical Activity in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes via an Anthropomorphic Conversational Agent: Development of an Evidence and Theory-Based Multi-Behavior Intervention,"Pimenta, N.; Félix, I.B.; Monteiro, D.; Marques, M.M.; Guerreiro, M.P.","Introduction: Anthropomorphic conversational agents (ACA) are a promising digital tool to support self-management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), albeit little explored. There is a dearth of literature on the detailed content of these interventions, which may limit effectiveness and replication. Our aim is to describe the development of an evidence and theory-based intervention to improve physical activity in older adults with T2D, subsumed in a multi-behavior intervention via a mobile application with an ACA. Methods: Overall decisions on the multi-behavior intervention design, such as the use of standardized behavior change techniques (BCTTv1), guided the development of the physical activity component. Firstly, recommendations on ambulatory activity were used to select the target behavior (walking). Meta-research on effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) was then identified. One meta-analysis linked effective BCTs with the three basic psychological needs of the self-determination theory (SDT). This meta-analysis, taken together with additional evidence on SDT, led to the selection of this theory to inform the design. BCTs were extracted from meta-research; we selected the most appropriate to be operationalized via the conversational agent through multidisciplinary discussions. Rules governing the dialogue flow and BCTs tailoring, taking the form “if some conditions hold then execute some action,” were derived based on the Basic Psychological in Exercise Scale (competence, autonomy, and relatedness scores), in conjunction with published evidence and multidisciplinary discussions. Results: Thirteen BCTs were implemented in the prototype via the ACA (e.g., goal setting behavior 1.1). Six if-then rules were derived and depicted in the dialogue steps through process flow diagrams, which map how the system functions. An example of a rule is “If competence score ≤ 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 500 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal; If competence score > 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 1,000 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal.” Conclusion: Evidence and SDT were translated into a mobile application prototype using an ACA to promote physical activity in older adults with T2D. This approach, which includes 13 BCTs and six if-then rules for their tailoring, may leverage the efforts of others in developing similar interventions.

The softening of Chinese digital propaganda: Evidence from the People’s Daily Weibo account during the pandemic,"Zhang, C.; Zhang, D.; Shao, H.L.","Introduction: Social media infuses modern relationships with vitality and brings a series of information dissemination with subjective consciousness. Studies have indicated that official Chinese media channels are transforming their communication style from didactic hard persuasion to softened emotional management in the digital era. However, previous studies have rarely provided valid empirical evidence for the communicational transformation. The study fills the gap by providing a longitudinal time-series analysis to reveal the pattern of communication of Chinese digital Chinese official media from 2019 to 2022. Method: The study crawler collected 43,259 posts from the People’s Daily’s Weibo account from 2019 to 2021. The study analyzed the textual data with using trained artificial intelligence models. Results: This study explored the practices of the People’s Daily’s Weibo account from 2019 to 2021, COVID-19 is hardly normalized as it is still used as the justification for extraordinary measures in China. This study confirmed that People’s Daily’s Weibo account posts are undergoing softenization transformation, with the use of soft news, positive energy promotion, and the embedding of sentiment. Although the outburst of COVID-19 temporarily increased the media’s use of hard news, it only occur at the initial stage of the pandemic. Emotional posts occupy a nonnegligible amount of the People’s Daily Weibo content. However, the majority of posts are emotionally neutral and contribute to shaping the authoritative image of the party press. Discussion: Overall, the People’s Daily has softened their communication style on digital platforms and used emotional mobilization, distraction, and timely information provision to balance the political logic of building an authoritative media agency and the media logic of constructing audience relevance.

Determinants of the implementation of an artificial intelligence-supported device for the screening of diabetic retinopathy in primary care – a qualitative study,"Held, L.A.; Wewetzer, L.; Steinhäuser, J.","Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus that is usually asymptomatic in the early stages. Therefore, its timely detection and treatment are essential. First pilot projects exist to establish a smartphone-based and AI-supported screening of DR in primary care. This study explored health professionals’ perceptions of potential barriers and enablers of using a screening such as this in primary care to understand the mechanisms that could influence implementation into routine clinical practice. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted and analysed with the help of qualitative analysis of Mayring. The following main influencing factors to implementation have been identified: personal attitude, organisation, time, financial factors, education, support, technical requirement, influence on profession and patient welfare.

An Overview of Chatbot-Based Mobile Mental Health Apps: Insights From App Description and User Reviews,"Haque, M.D.R.; Rubya, S.","Background: Chatbots are an emerging technology that show potential for mental health care apps to enable effective and practical evidence-based therapies. As this technology is still relatively new, little is known about recently developed apps and their characteristics and effectiveness. Objective: In this study, we aimed to provide an overview of the commercially available popular mental health chatbots and how they are perceived by users. Methods: We conducted an exploratory observation of 10 apps that offer support and treatment for a variety of mental health concerns with a built-in chatbot feature and qualitatively analyzed 3621 consumer reviews from the Google Play Store and 2624 consumer reviews from the Apple App Store. Results: We found that although chatbots’ personalized, humanlike interactions were positively received by users, improper responses and assumptions about the personalities of users led to a loss of interest. As chatbots are always accessible and convenient, users can become overly attached to them and prefer them over interacting with friends and family. Furthermore, a chatbot may offer crisis care whenever the user needs it because of its 24/7 availability, but even recently developed chatbots lack the understanding of properly identifying a crisis. Chatbots considered in this study fostered a judgment-free environment and helped users feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chatbots have great potential to offer social and psychological support in situations where real-world human interaction, such as connecting to friends or family members or seeking professional support, is not preferred or possible to achieve. However, there are several restrictions and limitations that these chatbots must establish according to the level of service they offer. Too much reliance on technology can pose risks, such as isolation and insufficient assistance during times of crisis. Recommendations for customization and balanced persuasion to inform the design of effective chatbots for mental health support have been outlined based on the insights of our findings. ©M D Romael Haque, Sabirat Rubya.",2023,,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,11,,,,10.2196/44838,,#5468,Haque 2023,,,0
"Deepfake, or Provisional Signs Marked by the Presence of Nonpresence","Harrison, S.","Until we make the necessary decision to jettison deepfake from our discussions of AI-generated media, we will fail to invent arguments that are well suited to the needs of people who do not live their lives in relation to a digital environment filled with fake and genuine media but, instead, to a digital environment that presents computer-articulated human beings with a diet of provisional simulations marked by the presence of nonpresence. Even though deepfake has come to mean very much the same thing to people from different walks of life when pressed to invent persuasive claims about deepfake media at the rhetorical levels of conjecture, definition, quality, and action, the rhetorical work that has been done at the level of definition has created an exigence within the discourse on deepfake media. Because culturally recognizable digital forms, including deepfakes, are computer-generated simulations, it must be concluded that deepfake simulations express themselves in the manner of simulations, meaning that they give provisional (arranged for the present, changeable, temporary) expression, marked by the presence of nonpresence, to mathematically described, algorithmically defined models of the real. Being another form of simulation within an environment of simulations, deepfake cannot be defined as either fake, false, or inauthentic, or genuine, true, or authentic. Instead, computer-generated media, including deepfakes, must be defined as provisional signs that circulate above and beyond the order of truth as defined by both the order of obligatory signs (medieval) and the order of arbitrary signs (modern) because computer-generated simulations of arbitrary signs are constrained to speak the absence of presence, the presence of a concept not present, the presence of nonpresence. © 2023 Common Ground Research Networks.

A stage model for agent-based emotional persuasion with an adaptive target: From a social exchange perspective,"Qie, X.; Wu, J.; Li, Y.; Sun, Y.","Agent-based automated negotiation is a promising approach for business negotiation; however, most studies in this field focus on negotiation strategies, ignoring the role of similarities between negotiating parties and the interactive social nature of negotiations. This study considers similarities between proposed and expected values in automatic negotiations to improve the agent perception ability. A cloud model was innovatively applied to calculate similarities, and overcome subjective characterization of proposed values in negotiations. Additionally, two social factors, i.e., emotion and familiarity, were identified in negotiations, the Web-Fechner law was applied to model an agent's generation of emotion, and a familiarity function was constructed to measure the level of familiarity between negotiating agents. Finally, a stage model for agent-based emotional negotiation which integrates similarity, emotion, and familiarity was established. A series of numerical experiments were conducted and comparative analyses of the proposed model with other similarity measures and existing negotiation models were conducted to test the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can lead to more successful negotiations and fairer negotiating outcomes and simultaneously, maintain competitive negotiation efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.",2022,,Information Sciences,610,,90-113,,10.1016/j.ins.2022.07.147,,#5472,Qie 2022,,,0

Using testimonial narratives to persuade people about artificial intelligence: the role of attitudinal similarity with the protagonist of the message,"Igartua, J.-J.; Arcila-Calderón, C.; González-Vázquez, A.","This study addresses the factors that increase the persuasive impact of testimonial narrative messages on artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, the effect on two variables that, to date, have not been explored in this field is analyzed: the attitudes toward AI (positive versus ambivalent) expressed by the protagonist of the narrative message (a testimonial in audiovisual format) and the role of participants’ prior beliefs about AI. An online experiment (N = 652) was carried out to contrast the effect of attitudinal similarity on identification with the protagonist of the narrative message and the indirect effect on attitudes and intention to use AI. The results showed that the message whose protagonist expressed positive attitudes toward AI induced greater identification only in those participants with previous positive beliefs. In contrast, the message whose protagonist expressed ambivalent attitudes toward AI induced greater identification only among participants with previous negative beliefs. In addition, identification and cognitive elaboration were found to mediate the effect of attitudinal similarity on the attitude toward and intention to use AI. These findings are discussed in the context of narrative persuasion research and the development of campaigns for improving social perceptions of data science. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

A XGBoost-Based Lane Change Prediction on Time Series Data Using Feature Engineering for Autopilot Vehicles,"Zhang, Y.; Shi, X.; Zhang, S.; Abraham, A.","Road accidents wreck lives. Could technology stop them from happening? Driving better road safety with technology and artificial intelligence are the key elements considered by several carmakers. The key aspect of transportation in the future is to build an ecosystem comprising autonomous, connected, electric and shared mobility. The evolution of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can potentially aid transportation to people and be deployed to resolve mobility-related pain for drivers and safety on roads while changing lanes. Thus, the intelligent assistance system should be smart enough to track such vehicles while deviating into another lane. In this paper, we propose a lane change prediction framework for feature learning, with the aim to have a deep and comprehensive understanding of lane change behaviors, meanwhile, reach a high performance based on the selected features. A time-step dataset with more than 1000 features is constructed from vehicle trajectory data. To identify the key features involved in the original feature set, an XGBoost-based three-step feature learning algorithm is proposed, which integrates the feature importance ranking, metric selection and recursive feature elimination. After analyzing the accuracy of test data from different time segment positions, the sliding window method is applied on a time-step dataset with filtered features to properly select time segments, which are flattened into corresponding time-series dataset for model prediction. In our case studies, a publicly available dataset, Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM), is adopted to conduct experiments of feature learning and lane change prediction, where we achieved a new state-of-art accuracy with 97.6% under the time-series data of 75 selected features and 1-second window size with predictor XGBoost after adopting proposed three-step method, which is superior to the other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.",2022,,IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems,23,10,19187-19200,,10.1109/TITS.2022.3170628,,#5477,Zhang 2022,,,0

"Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER): Development of a Conceptual Framework","Dhinagaran, D.A.; Martinengo, L.; Ho, M.-H.R.; Joty, S.; Kowatsch, T.; Atun, R.; Car, L.T.","Background: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care. Methods: We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. Results: The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations-user-centered design and privacy and security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

"Explanatory classification of CXR images into COVID-19, Pneumonia and Tuberculosis using deep learning and XAI","Bhandari, M.; Shahi, T.B.; Siku, B.; Neupane, A.","Chest X-ray (CXR) images are considered useful to monitor and investigate a variety of pulmonary disorders such as COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis (TB). With recent technological advancements, such diseases may now be recognized more precisely using computer-assisted diagnostics. Without compromising the classification accuracy and better feature extraction, deep learning (DL) model to predict four different categories is proposed in this study. The proposed model is validated with publicly available datasets of 7132 chest x-ray (CXR) images. Furthermore, results are interpreted and explained using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Local Interpretable Modelagnostic Explanation (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for better understandably. Initially, convolution features are extracted to collect high-level object-based information. Next, shapely values from SHAP, predictability results from LIME, and heatmap from Grad-CAM are used to explore the black-box approach of the DL model, achieving average test accuracy of 94.31 ± 1.01% and validation accuracy of 94.54 ± 1.33 for 10-fold cross validation. Finally, in order to validate the model and qualify medical risk, medical sensations of classification are taken to consolidate the explanations generated from the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework. The results suggest that XAI and DL models give clinicians/medical professionals persuasive and coherent conclusions related to the detection and categorization of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and TB. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Computers in Biology and Medicine,150,,,,10.1016/j.compbiomed.2022.106156,,#5481,Bhandari 2022,,,0

Modelling Physical Activity Behaviour Changes for Personalised Feedback in a Health Education Application,"Diaz, C.; Galy, O.; Caillaud, C.; Yacef, K.","Open-ended domains, where the focus is not about learning specific expert movements but about adopting healthy physical activity behaviours, require the use of unsupervised algorithms and artificial intelligence in education techniques for modelling evolving patterns from physical activity sensor data to enable feedback and personalisation. We present a suite of unsupervised window-based algorithms that detect physical activity changes aligned with learning objectives from accelerometer data. These are translated into learner model attributes and used to generate timely feedback. We illustrate our method in the context of a health education program that teaches adolescents about healthy physical activity behaviours through an application connected to a wrist-worn activity tracker. We present the feedback generated by our algorithms and report on the qualitative evaluation with four experts. We conclude that the automated feedback is useful, important and timely to leverage adolescents' physical activity learning. © 30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings.",2022,,"30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings",1,,369-374,,,,#5484,Diaz 2022,,,0
Can Chatbots Be Persuasive? How to Boost the Effectiveness of Chatbot Recommendations for Increasing Purchase Intention,"Schwede, M.; Meyer, N.; von Schnakenburg, N.; Hammerschmidt, M.","Firms increasingly invest in chatbots that provide purchase recommendations. However, customers often reject recommendations by chatbots because they find neither the contents of the recommendation (message-level persuasiveness) nor the chatbot itself (source-level persuasiveness) persuasive. To overcome these barriers and increase purchase intention, this study examines how the content of recommendation messages should be designed and which communication style the chatbot should use to provide recommendation messages. Results of a 2 (two-sided vs. one-sided recommendation message) × 3 (warm vs. competent vs. neutral communication style) between-subject online experiment show that a two-sided recommendation message increases purchase intention, but only for chatbots using a warm or competent communication style. Whereas a warm chatbot leads to higher purchase intentions of a recommendation through promoting its source persuasiveness, a competent chatbot increases recommendation effectiveness by promoting message persuasiveness. Therefore, firms should refine a chatbot's communication style for providing recommendations that persuade customers to purchase. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

Prediction of conversion to dementia using interpretable machine learning in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment,"Chun, M.Y.; Park, C.J.; Kim, J.; Jeong, J.H.; Jang, H.; Kim, K.; Seo, S.W.","Purpose: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, not all aMCI patients are observed to convert to AD dementia. Therefore, developing a predictive algorithm for the conversion of aMCI to AD dementia is important. Parametric methods, such as logistic regression, have been developed; however, it is difficult to reflect complex patterns, such as non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the predictive power of aMCI patients’ conversion to dementia by using an interpretable machine learning (IML) algorithm and to identify the factors that increase the risk of individual conversion to dementia in each patient. Methods: We prospectively recruited 705 patients with aMCI who had been followed-up for at least 3 years after undergoing baseline neuropsychological tests at the Samsung Medical Center between 2007 and 2019. We used neuropsychological tests and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype data to develop a predictive algorithm. The model-building and validation datasets were composed of data of 565 and 140 patients, respectively. For global interpretation, four algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting) were compared. For local interpretation, individual conditional expectations (ICE) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to analyze individual patients. Results: Among the four algorithms, the extreme gradient boost model showed the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.852 and an accuracy of 0.807. Variables, such as age, education, the scores of visuospatial and memory domains, the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE genotype were important features for creating the algorithm. Through ICE and SHAP analyses, it was also possible to interpret which variables acted as strong factors for each patient. Conclusion: We were able to propose a predictive algorithm for each aMCI individual’s conversion to dementia using the IML technique. This algorithm is expected to be useful in clinical practice and the research field, as it can suggest conversion with high accuracy and identify the degree of influence of risk factors for each patient.

The Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents (Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations,"Chew, H.S.J.","Background: Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss. Objective: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched. Results: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality-based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances. Conclusions: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

"Emerging trends: Unfair, biased, addictive, dangerous, deadly, and insanely profitable","Church, K.; Schoene, A.; Ortega, J.E.; Chandrasekar, R.; Kordoni, V.","There has been considerable work recently in the natural language community and elsewhere on Responsible AI. Much of this work focuses on fairness and biases (henceforth Risks 1.0), following the 2016 best seller: Weapons of Math Destruction. Two books published in 2022, The Chaos Machine and Like, Comment, Subscribe, raise additional risks to public health/safety/security such as genocide, insurrection, polarized politics, vaccinations (henceforth, Risks 2.0). These books suggest that the use of machine learning to maximize engagement in social media has created a Frankenstein Monster that is exploiting human weaknesses with persuasive technology, the illusory truth effect, Pavlovian conditioning, and Skinner's intermittent variable reinforcement. Just as we cannot expect tobacco companies to sell fewer cigarettes and prioritize public health ahead of profits, so too, it may be asking too much of companies (and countries) to stop trafficking in misinformation given that it is so effective and so insanely profitable (at least in the short term). Eventually, we believe the current chaos will end, like the lawlessness in Wild West, because chaos is bad for business. As computer scientists, this paper will summarize criticisms from other fields and focus on implications for computer science; we will not attempt to contribute to those other fields. There is quite a bit of work in computer science on these risks, especially on Risks 1.0 (bias and fairness), but more work is needed, especially on Risks 2.0 (addictive, dangerous, and deadly). © The Author(s), 2022.

Understanding Preconception Women's Needs and Preferences for Digital Health Resources: Qualitative Study,"Walker, R.E.; Quong, S.; Olivier, P.; Wu, L.; Xie, J.; Boyle, J.","Background: Improving preconception health can benefit all women, their children, and their families regardless of their individual pregnancy intentions. Rapidly increasing access to information technology and online engagement have created opportunities to use digital health resources to engage with preconception women regarding lifestyle behaviors. Objective: This study explores how preconception women engage with digital health resources and online platforms to inform the design and development of a digital health resource to support women to make positive behavior change for their preconception health. Methods: This codesign research followed the Double Diamond process, which focuses on contextualization and explorative processes in phase 1 and ideation and development processes in phase 2. Phase 1 is reported on in this study and was undertaken via a series of 1-on-1 in-depth interviews with female participants (N=12) aged 18-45 years over 3 months. Interviews were designed to explore participants' lived experiences in relation to their health and desired supports for healthy lifestyle behaviors. The first interview focused on participants' perceptions of health and health behaviors, the second interview focused on social connections for health, and the third interview focused on digital health information and supports. Conversations from the first interview informed the development of the second interview, and conversations from the second interview informed the development of the third interview. Community advisors (N=8) met to provide feedback and advice to the researchers throughout the interview process. Qualitative analyses of transcripts from interviews were undertaken by 2 researchers before a deductive process identified themes mapped to the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) framework. Results: In total, 9 themes and 8 subthemes were identified from 124 codes. In relation to digital health resources, specifically, participants were already engaging with a range of digital health resources and had high expectations of these. Digital health resources needed to be easy to access, make women's busy lives easier, be evidence based, and be reputable. Social connectedness was also highly important to our participants, with information and advice from peers with similar experiences being preferred over yet more online health information. Online communities facilitated these social interactions. Participants were open to the idea of chatbots and virtual assistants but acknowledged that they would not replace authentic social interactions. Conclusions: Codesigned digital health resources should be evidence based, reputable, and easy to access. Social connections were considered highly important to women, and designers of digital health resources should consider how they can increase opportunities for women to connect and learn from each other to promote health behaviors. ©Ruth Elizabeth Walker, Sara Quong, Patrick Olivier, Ling Wu, Jue Xie, Jacqueline Boyle.

Green E-Commerce,"Wernbacher, T.; Platzer, M.; Seewald, A.; Winter, T.; Wimmer, S.; Pfeiffer, A.","At present, the e-commerce sector is characterised by rapidly increasing volumes of parcel deliveries, causing congestion, noise and air pollution in public spaces. The number of CEPs is also increasing due to more partial deliveries, multiple delivery attempts and a high number of returns. According to the 'eCommerce Study Austria', the return rate for the year 2020 will be over 40 percent. Increased freight transport on the last mile will lead to more congestion, noise and emissions. On the demand side, online shops often offer no or only very limited climate-friendly delivery options, which contradicts the growing sustainability awareness of many end customers. The design, development and evaluation of technological, behavioural and logistical interventions will address these gaps. The Green eCommerce project aims to enable online customers to make their deliveries more sustainable and to increase their awareness of sustainable goods transport through technological (Al-based chatbot, 3D fitting tool), behavioural (playful reward system, persuasive design patterns) and logistical (choice of e-transport) innovations. In particular, the aim is to minimise returns and multiple home delivery attempts, and to encourage bulk ordering and direct delivery of regional products. The extension of existing online shops with these innovative and modular components represents a novelty in the sense that traffic avoidance, traffic optimisation and modal shift can be achieved through the behaviour of online customers. Compared to current measures in freight logistics (e.g. route optimisation, electrification of the fleet, construction of hubs), this persuasive approach aimed at the end consumer has hardly been researched. This package of measures is currently being implemented in three online shops and evaluated in terms of acceptance, usability and environmental impact. © 2023 IEEE.",2023,,"2023 IEEE 9th International Conference on Computing, Engineering and Design, ICCED 2023",,,,,10.1109/ICCED60214.2023.10425195,,#5492,Wernbacher 2023,,,0
A persona aware persuasive dialogue policy for dynamic and co-operative goal setting,"Tiwari, A.; Saha, T.; Saha, S.; Sengupta, S.; Maitra, A.; Ramnani, R.; Bhattacharyya, P.","Contextualization: In recent years, the popularity of virtual agents particularly task-oriented dialogue agents has increased immensely due to their effectiveness and simplicity in various domains such as industry, e-commerce, and health. Problem: In real-world, users do not have always a predefined and immutable goal, i.e., they may upgrade/downgrade/update their task goal dynamically depending upon their utility and the serving capability of the assisting agent. However, the existing Virtual Agents (VAs) in the dialogue literature relinquish and yield dialogue failure if they find any dynamic goal setting or goal unavailability scenarios. Contributions and methodology: Motivated by these inabilities of existing VAs, we propose some intelligent and expert Dialogue Agents (A Unified Dialogue Agent and Multi-agent Dialogue system) that can deal with dynamic and goal unavailability situations to elevate both user satisfaction and the agent's utility particularly task success rate. The proposed architecture incorporates a goal guiding module namely Dynamic and Co-Operative Goal Driven Module (DyCoGDM), which traces goal status and resolves goal discrepancy through dynamic goal setting (Goal Formulator) and personalized persuasion (Goal Persuader) mechanisms. We also created and annotated a dialogue corpus because of unavailability of such corpus featured with dynamic and goal unavailability scenarios. Findings and implications: Our proposed method outperforms several baselines and state of the art methods in all evaluation metrics. The proposed VA is capable of dealing with dynamic goals and goal unavailability scenarios effectively. The study found that the persona aware persuasive dialogue agent outperforms generalized persuasive dialogue agent by a large margin. Furthermore, we also observed that the task oriented reward is the most essential reward for training a reinforcement learning based agent and agents trained without task based reward do not even converge. © 2021",2022,,Expert Systems with Applications,195,,,,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116303,,#5493,Tiwari 2022,,,0

Testing Behavioral Nudges and Prompts in Digital Courses for the Self-guided Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: Protocol for a 3-Arm Randomized Controlled Trial,"Rondina, R.; van Mierlo, T.; Fournier, R.","Background: Despite showing strong evidence of positive outcomes, a common problem in the field of digital health is poor engagement and adherence. Non-health care, for-profit digital ventures, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, conduct behavioral experiments to increase user engagement. To our knowledge, digital health organizations have not published similar types of experiments in ad libitum environments, and there are limited published data indicating whether nudges and prompts can be leveraged to increase engagement with digital health interventions. Objective: The main objective of our 3-arm randomized controlled trial is to test whether registered members in two well-established digital health courses for anxiety and depression will engage with four different types of nudges and prompts, and whether engaging with nudges and prompts increases engagement within the courses. Methods: New members who register for the self-guided anxiety and depression courses on the Evolution Health platform will be randomized into 1 of 3 arms. The first control arm will feature a member home page without any behavioral nudges or prompts. The second arm will feature a member home page with a Tip-of-the-Day section containing directive content. Arm 3 will feature a member home page with a Tip-of-the-Day section containing social proof and present bias content. The third arm will also feature a to-do item checklist. Results: The experiment was designed in August 2021 and was launched in November 2021. Initially, we will measure engagement with the tips and the to-do checklist by calculating the frequency of use by age and gender. If members do engage, we will then, according to age and gender, examine whether nudges and prompts result in higher course completion rates and whether specific types of prompts and nudges are more popular than others. Conclusions: Our 3-arm randomized controlled trial will be the first to compare four distinct types of behavioral prompts and nudges in two self-guided digital health courses that were designed to treat mental health issues. We expect the results to generate insights into which types of behavioral prompts and nudges work best in the population. If they are shown to increase engagement, the insights will then be used to apply prompts and nudges to the platform's addiction-focused courses. Based on the results of the experiment, the insights will be applied to using artificial intelligence to train the platform to recognize different usage patterns and provide specific engagement recommendations to stratified users. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

Algorithmic Bayesian Persuasion with Combinatorial Actions,"Fujii, K.; Sakaue, S.","Bayesian persuasion is a model for understanding strategic information revelation: an agent with an informational advantage, called a sender, strategically discloses information by sending signals to another agent, called a receiver. In algorithmic Bayesian persuasion, we are interested in efficiently designing the sender's signaling schemes that lead the receiver to take action in favor of the sender. This paper studies algorithmic Bayesian-persuasion settings where the receiver's feasible actions are specified by combinatorial constraints, e.g., matroids or paths in graphs. We first show that constant-factor approximation is NP-hard even in some special cases of matroids or paths. We then propose a polynomial-time algorithm for general matroids by assuming the number of states of nature to be a constant. We finally consider a relaxed notion of persuasiveness, called CCE-persuasiveness, and present a sufficient condition for polynomial-time approximability. © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

How to Achieve Ethical Persuasive Design: A Review and Theoretical Propositions for Information Systems,"Benner, D.; Schöbel, S.; Janson, A.; Leimeister, J.M.","Persuasive system design (PSD) is an umbrella term for designs in information systems (IS) that can influence people’s attitude, behavior, or decision making for better or for worse. On the one hand, PSD can improve users’ engagement and motivation to change their attitude, behavior, or decision making in a favorable way, which can help them achieve a desired outcome and, thus, improve their wellbeing. On the other hand, PSD misuse can lead to unethical and undesirable outcomes, such as disclosing unnecessary information or agreeing to terms that do not favor users, which, in turn, can negatively impact their wellbeing. These powerful persuasive designs can involve concepts such as gamification, gamblification, and digital nudging, which all have become prominent in recent years and have been implemented successfully across different sectors, such as education, e-health, e-governance, e-finance, and digital privacy contexts. However, such persuasive influence on individuals raises ethical questions as PSD can impair users’ autonomy or persuade them towards a third party’s goals and, hence, lead to unethical decision-making processes and outcomes. In human-computer interaction, recent advances in artificial intelligence have made this topic particularly significant. These novel technologies allow one to influence the decisions that users make, to gather data, and to profile and persuade users into unethical outcomes. These unethical outcomes can lead to psychological and emotional damage to users. To understand the role that ethics play in persuasive system design, we conducted an exhaustive systematic literature analysis and 20 interviews to overview ethical considerations for persuasive system design. Furthermore, we derive potential propositions for more ethical PSD and shed light on potential research gaps. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.",2022,,AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction,14,4,548-577,,10.17705/1thci.00179,,#5499,Benner 2022,,,0
Personalized Digital Health Communications to Increase COVID-19 Vaccination in Underserved Populations: A Double Diamond Approach to Behavioral Design,"Ford, K.L.; West, A.B.; Bucher, A.; Osborn, C.Y.","The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing health disparities. People of historically underserved communities, including racial and ethnic minority groups and people with lower incomes and educational attainments, experienced disproportionate premature mortality, access to healthcare, and vaccination acceptance and adoption. At the same time, the pandemic increased reliance on digital devices, offering a unique opportunity to leverage digital communication channels to address health inequities, particularly related to COVID-19 vaccination. We offer a real-world, systematic approach to designing personalized behavior change email and text messaging interventions that address individual barriers with evidence-based behavioral science inclusive of underserved populations. Integrating design processes such as the Double Diamond model with evidence-based behavioral science intervention development offers a unique opportunity to create equitable interventions. Further, leveraging behavior change artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities allows for both personalizing and automating that personalization to address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination at scale. The result is an intervention whose broad component library meets the needs of a diverse population and whose technology can deliver the right components for each individual.

Machine learning and artificial intelligence in cardiac transplantation: A systematic review,"Naruka, V.; Arjomandi Rad, A.; Subbiah Ponniah, H.; Francis, J.; Vardanyan, R.; Tasoudis, P.; Magouliotis, D.E.; Lazopoulos, G.L.; Salmasi, M.Y.; Athanasiou, T.","Background: This review aims to systematically evaluate the currently available evidence investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the field of cardiac transplantation. Furthermore, based on the challenges identified we aim to provide a series of recommendations and a knowledge base for future research in the field of ML and heart transplantation. Methods: A systematic database search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of ML and/or AI in heart transplantation in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, from inception to November 2021. Results: Our search yielded 237 articles, of which 13 studies were included in this review, featuring 463 850 patients. Three main areas of application were identified: (1) ML for predictive modeling of heart transplantation mortality outcomes; (2) ML in graft failure outcomes; (3) ML to aid imaging in heart transplantation. The results of the included studies suggest that AI and ML are more accurate in predicting graft failure and mortality than traditional scoring systems and conventional regression analysis. Major predictors of graft failure and mortality identified in ML models were: length of hospital stay, immunosuppressive regimen, recipient's age, congenital heart disease, and organ ischemia time. Other potential benefits include analyzing initial lab investigations and imaging, assisting a patient with medication adherence, and creating positive behavioral changes to minimize further cardiovascular risk. Conclusion: ML demonstrated promising applications for improving heart transplantation outcomes and patient-centered care, nevertheless, there remain important limitations relating to implementing AI into everyday surgical practices. © 2022 The Authors.

Reducing Flipping Errors in Deep Neural Networks,"Deng, X.; Xiao, Y.; Long, B.; Zhang, Z.","Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in various domains in artificial intelligence including computer vision and natural language processing. A DNN is typically trained for many epochs and then a validation dataset is used to select the DNN in an epoch (we simply call this epoch “the last epoch”) as the final model for making predictions on unseen samples, while it usually cannot achieve a perfect accuracy on unseen samples. An interesting question is “how many test (unseen) samples that a DNN misclassifies in the last epoch were ever correctly classified by the DNN before the last epoch?”. In this paper, we empirically study this question and find on several benchmark datasets that the vast majority of the misclassified samples in the last epoch were ever classified correctly before the last epoch, which means that the predictions for these samples were flipped from “correct” to “wrong”. Motivated by this observation, we propose to restrict the behavior changes of a DNN on the correctly-classified samples so that the correct local boundaries can be maintained and the flipping error on unseen samples can be largely reduced. Extensive experiments1 on different benchmark datasets with different modern network architectures demonstrate that the proposed flipping error reduction (FER) approach can substantially improve the generalization, the robustness, and the transferability of DNNs without introducing any additional network parameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead.

Conversational Agents in Health Care: Scoping Review of Their Behavior Change Techniques and Underpinning Theory,"Martinengo, L.; Jabir, A.I.; Goh, W.W.T.; Lo, N.Y.W.; Ringo Ho, M.-H.; Kowatsch, T.; Atun, R.; Michie, S.; Car, L.T.","Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used in health care to deliver behavior change interventions. Their evaluation often includes categorizing the behavior change techniques (BCTs) using a classification system of which the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) is one of the most common. Previous studies have presented descriptive summaries of behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, but no in-depth study reporting the use of BCTs in these interventions has been published to date. Objective: This review aims to describe behavior change interventions delivered by CAs and to identify the BCTs and theories guiding their design. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the first 10 pages of Google and Google Scholar in April 2021. We included primary, experimental studies evaluating a behavior change intervention delivered by a CA. BCTs coding followed the BCTTv1. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. Descriptive analysis and frequent itemset mining to identify BCT clusters were performed. Results: We included 47 studies reporting on mental health (n=19, 40%), chronic disorders (n=14, 30%), and lifestyle change (n=14, 30%) interventions. There were 20/47 embodied CAs (43%) and 27/47 CAs (57%) represented a female character. Most CAs were rule based (34/47, 72%). Experimental interventions included 63 BCTs, (mean 9 BCTs; range 2-21 BCTs), while comparisons included 32 BCTs (mean 2 BCTs; range 2-17 BCTs). Most interventions included BCTs 4.1 ""Instruction on how to perform a behavior"" (34/47, 72%), 3.3 ""Social support"" (emotional; 27/47, 57%), and 1.2 ""Problem solving"" (24/47, 51%). A total of 12/47 studies (26%) were informed by a behavior change theory, mainly the Transtheoretical Model and the Social Cognitive Theory. Studies using the same behavior change theory included different BCTs. Conclusions: There is a need for the more explicit use of behavior change theories and improved reporting of BCTs in CA interventions to enhance the analysis of intervention effectiveness and improve the reproducibility of research. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Using Artificial Intelligence to Enhance Ongoing Psychological Interventions for Emotional Problems in Real-or Close to Real-Time: A Systematic Review,"Gual-Montolio, P.; Jaén, I.; Martínez-Borba, V.; Castilla, D.; Suso-Ribera, C.","Emotional disorders are the most common mental disorders globally. Psychological treatments have been found to be useful for a significant number of cases, but up to 40% of patients do not respond to psychotherapy as expected. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods might enhance psychotherapy by providing therapists and patients with real-or close to real-time recommendations according to the patient’s response to treatment. The goal of this investigation is to systematically review the evidence on the use of AI-based methods to enhance outcomes in psychological interventions in real-time or close to real-time. The search included studies indexed in the electronic databases Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The terms used for the electronic search included variations of the words “psychotherapy”, “artificial intelligence”, and “emotional disorders”. From the 85 full texts assessed, only 10 studies met our eligibility criteria. In these, the most frequently used AI technique was conversational AI agents, which are chatbots based on software that can be accessed online with a computer or a smartphone. Overall, the reviewed investigations indicated significant positive consequences of using AI to enhance psychotherapy and reduce clinical symptomatology. Additionally, most studies reported high satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates when implementing AI to enhance psychotherapy in real-or close to real-time. Despite the potential of AI to make interventions more flexible and tailored to patients’ needs, more methodologically robust studies are needed. © 2022 by the authors.

Investigating Motivations and Patient Profiles for Personalization of Health Applications for Behaviour Change,"Bonneux, C.; Dendale, P.; Coninx, K.","Personalization is a key aspect when developing applications targeting health behaviour change. However, the use of personalized mobile interventions for lifestyle behaviour is still in its infancy. Based on our former research on mobile applications to support cardiac patients in health behaviour change, we identified four key motivations to enhance the personalization offered in applications targeting health behaviour change. In this paper, we propose a mixed-methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative data collected in prior studies, to apply personalization in the design of health applications. Our approach consists of five steps: 1) collecting data for personalization, 2) detecting patient profiles using clustering methods, 3) understanding patient profiles using a graphical representation, 4) describing patient profiles using personas, and 5) personalizing a health application according to patient profiles. One of the major strengths of our approach is that it combines established HCI techniques such as personas and data visualization techniques with methods from big data analytics and artificial intelligence to identify ways to personalize health applications. We conclude by presenting future directions to apply personalization in the domain of health technologies.  © 2022 ACM.",2022,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,146-154,,10.1145/3529190.3529201,,#5505,Bonneux 2022,,,0
An Artificial Intelligence-Driven Digital Health Solution to Support Clinical Management of Patients With Long COVID-19: Protocol for a Prospective Multicenter Observational Study,"Fuster-Casanovas, A.; Fernandez-Luque, L.; Nuñez-Benjumea, F.J.; Conde, A.M.; Luque-Romero, L.G.; Bilionis, I.; Escudero, C.R.; Giglioli, I.A.C.; Vidal-Alaball, J.","Background: COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the weaknesses of most health systems around the world, collapsing them and depleting their available health care resources. Fortunately, the development and enforcement of specific public health policies, such as vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, among others, has reduced the prevalence and complications associated with COVID-19 in its acute phase. However, the aftermath of the global pandemic has called for an efficient approach to manage patients with long COVID-19. This is a great opportunity to leverage on innovative digital health solutions to provide exhausted health care systems with the most cost-effective and efficient tools available to support the clinical management of this population. In this context, the SENSING-AI project is focused on the research toward the implementation of an artificial intelligence-driven digital health solution that supports both the adaptive self-management of people living with long COVID-19 and the health care staff in charge of the management and follow-up of this population. Objective: The objective of this protocol is the prospective collection of psychometric and biometric data from 10 patients for training algorithms and prediction models to complement the SENSING-AI cohort. Methods: Publicly available health and lifestyle data registries will be consulted and complemented with a retrospective cohort of anonymized data collected from clinical information of patients diagnosed with long COVID-19. Furthermore, a prospective patient-generated data set will be captured using wearable devices and validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaires to complement the retrospective cohort. Finally, the 'Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse' guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship will be applied to the resulting data set to encourage the continuous process of discovery, evaluation, and reuse of information for the research community at large. Results: The SENSING-AI cohort is expected to be completed during 2022. It is expected that sufficient data will be obtained to generate artificial intelligence models based on behavior change and mental well-being techniques to improve patients' self-management, while providing useful and timely clinical decision support services to health care professionals based on risk stratification models and early detection of exacerbations. Conclusions: SENSING-AI focuses on obtaining high-quality data of patients with long COVID-19 during their daily life. Supporting these patients is of paramount importance in the current pandemic situation, including supporting their health care professionals in a cost-effective and efficient management of long COVID-19.  © 2022 Aïna Fuster-Casanovas.",2022,,JMIR Research Protocols,11,10,,,10.2196/37704,,#5506,Fuster-Casanovas 2022,,,0
Social influence and intention to use AI: the role of personal innovativeness and perceived trust using the parallel mediation model,"Kandoth, S.; Shekhar, S.K.","The crucial role of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting traditional hiring and recruiting proce-dures. AI is one of the most notable trends from 2021. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of social influence on the usage intention of the AI-based job application process using personal innovativeness and perceived trust as mediating variables. A descriptive cross-sectional online survey with 440 students from various South Indian universities revealed that social influence (SI) has a significant direct positive effect on the intention to use the AI-enabled job (IUAI) application process, and social influence has a significant direct positive effect on personal innovative-ness (PI). Personal innovativeness has a significant direct positive effect on the intention to use the AI-enabled job application process. Social influence has a significant direct positive effect on perceived trust (PT), and perceived trust has a significant direct positive effect on the intention to use the AI-enabled job application process. The study also dis-closed that personal innovativeness and perceived trust par-tially mediate social influence and the intention to use AI. It is proposed that various recruitment agencies incorporate the job application process using artificial intelligence for a smooth and effective recruitment process for the immense benefit of the stakeholders. Longitudinal research could also provide a more profound and generalised knowledge of using the AI-enabled job application process. The original-ity of the study opens a new and novel area for researchers, shedding light on job seekers’ perceptions of the AI-assisted job application process. It expands knowledge on how social persuasion, perceived trust, and personal innovativeness influence the likelihood of job seekers applying for jobs. The limitations of the study, implications for future research, and recommendations are also discussed. © 2022, WSB University.

A methodical interpretation of adaptive robotics: Study and reformulation,"Soufi Enayati, A.M.; Zhang, Z.; Najjaran, H.","The recent development of industrial manufacturing and social services has witnessed a significant trend of automation and intelligentization due to the wide application of robots and the technology of artificial intelligence (AI). While robots liberate humans from tedious and dangerous work in hazardous environments, AI simplifies the programming of robots by automatically inferring patterns and models from the interaction between the robots and the environment. Nevertheless, the application of robots and AI to more general manufacturing and social tasks is still limited by the lack of flexibility and adaptability to the changes in the task and the environment. Thus, a new concept, adaptive robotics, has been proposed to address the desire that an AI-powered robot should be able to properly reprogram itself to these changes without human intervention. Nevertheless, this concept is yet too abstract to provide any specific guidance to the development of robot programs. In this paper, we attempt to provide methodical redefinition and reformulation of adaptive robotics both in conceptual and mathematical manners based on the study of previous results. First of all, we introduce the essential motivation and the conceptual origination of adaptability of mechanical systems. Then, we review the previous literature and explore the related work of adaptive robotics. Based on this, we provide a uniform mathematical formulation of adaptive robotics based on adaptive and robust Markov-decision process (MDP). Through this work, we attempt to inspire the generic framework of adaptive robotics incorporating the existing immature paradigms, by which we are aiming at a clarified and well-defined context of adaptive robotics for future research on related domains. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Neurocomputing,512,,381-397,,10.1016/j.neucom.2022.09.114,,#5509,SoufiEnayati 2022,,,0

How the decision to accept or reject PV affects the behaviour of residential battery system adopters,"Alipour, M.; Taghikhah, F.; Irannezhad, E.; Stewart, R.A.; Sahin, O.","When residential rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely accepted across society, the uptake of home battery energy storage systems is closely tied to the PV-status quo and the behaviour previously taken by households. This study proposes that a decision of acceptance or rejection of PV systems is the past behaviour of the battery adoption decision. This antecedent role of PV behaviour may spark two attitudinal changes: (a) feelings of regret, which may occur among PV adopters, stemming from a positive experience of using the system, or among non-adopters due to their rejection of the system, and (b) feelings of despair, which may arise among current PV users due to dissatisfaction and discontent with the system. While regret positively changes consumers’ attitude towards battery adoption expediting an earlier purchase, despair could preclude battery installation. Through a survey of 557 households in South East Queensland, Australia, this study investigated factors driving attitude change. Instead of traditional statistical methods, machine learning algorithms were adopted to derive data-driven models of attitude change, allowing for higher prediction accuracy and a determination of the latent causalities. The main findings indicate that perceived attitudes towards financial and non-financial benefits, followed by informal peers, best estimate the attitude change, whereas traditional sociodemographic factors, knowledge and affordability may not engender a shift. Leveraging from this new paradigm can encourage current PV consumers to take another step and become earlier battery adopters. Failure to recognise these dynamics may breed despair and turn current innovators and early adopters of PVs into late adopters or rejectors of battery systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Applied Energy,318,,,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2022.119194,,#5512,Alipour 2022,,,0

Enhancing Transformative Learning and Innovation Skills Using Remote Learning for Sustainable Architecture Design,"Avsec, S.; Jagiełło-Kowalczyk, M.; Żabicka, A.","The currently used educational technology with artificial-intelligence-powered solutions, although rather instrumental, may lead to discontinuity in learning, as it lacks social and emotional value, which is an essential part of education for sustainable development and results in an immersive experience through which higher-order thinking skills can be adopted. This paper aims to explore transformative learning (TL) and innovation skill improvement accommodated by transactional distance theory in a 16-week remote sustainable architecture design course. The analysis identified the following: (a) significant progress in students’ attitudes toward uncertainty and criticality while social support differs due to the influence of classmates, faculty staff, teamwork, writing and reading assignments, promoters from industry and extracurricular activities; (b) significant progress in TL achievement while innovation skill development differs significantly across the groups in which online collaborative learning was found as an influencer in creativity and motivation; (c) self-efficacy influenced by feedback in and on actions, such as essay and other writing assignments, verbal persuasions and positive social comparisons; (d) lack of development of situational awareness, continuity of learning and interactions/situations to empower teammates in handling conflicts to develop leadership ability; (e) decrease in risk-taking ability, especially in a group of students in which social support was limited due to the absence of challenging situations and tasks.

Our review of the past 10-years' work in the area reveals that 1) the considered papers focused on seven main healthy behaviors, where ""alcohol use""emerged as the most commonly considered behavior; 2) trustworthiness emerged as the most commonly used persuasive strategy; 3) youth are the most targeted audience; 4) VR is more common than AR; and 5) most AR- or VR-driven interventions are perceived to be effective in motivating healthy behavior in people. We also uncover how they use Artificial Intelligence and Object Tracking in this space. Finally, we identify gaps and offer recommendations for advancing research in this area.  © 2022 ACM.",2022,,IMX 2022 - Proceedings of the 2022 ACM International Conference on Interactive Media Experiences,,,53-68,,10.1145/3505284.3529964,,#5518,PaulOdenigbo 2022,,,0
Using dialogues to increase positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in a vaccine-hesitant UK population,"Brand, C.O.; Stafford, T.","Recently, Altay et al. (Altay et al. 2021. J. Exp.Psychol.: Appl. (doi:10.1037/xap0000400)) showed that 5 min of interaction with a chatbot led to increases in positive COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and intentions in a French population. Here we replicate this effect in a vaccine-hesitant, UK-based population. We attempt to isolate what made the chatbot condition effective by controlling the amount of information provided, the trustworthiness of the information and the level of interactivity. Like Altay et al., our experiment allowed participants to navigate a branching dialogue by choosing questions of interest about COVID-19 vaccines. Our control condition used the same questions and answers but removed participant choice by presenting the dialogues at random. Importantly, we also targeted those who were either against or neutral towards COVID-19 vaccinations to begin with, screening-out those with already positive attitudes. Replicating Altay et al., we found a similar size increase in positive attitudes towards vaccination, and in intention to get vaccinated. Unlike Altay et al., we found no difference between our two conditions: choosing the questions did not increase vaccine attitudes or intentions any more than our control condition. These results suggest that the attitudes of the vaccine hesitant are modifiable with exposure to in-depth, trustworthy and engaging dialogues.  © 2022 The Authors.",2022,,Royal Society Open Science,9,10,,,10.1098/rsos.220366,,#5519,Brand 2022,,,0

Predicting and explaining lane-changing behaviour using machine learning: A comparative study,"Ali, Y.; Hussain, F.; Bliemer, M.C.J.; Zheng, Z.; Haque, M.M.","Predicting lane-changing behaviour is an integral part of lane-changing decision models and has a significant impact on both traffic flow characteristics and traffic safety. A variety of lane-changing decision models have been developed for this purpose, with most of them focussing only on explaining lane-changing behaviour, while assessing the predictive capability of these models has comparatively received less attention. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques are often preferred for prediction purposes, but their application to predicting lane-changing behaviour is limited. However, the lack of interpretability of machine learning techniques is often criticised and needs a solution. Motivated by these research needs, this study explains and predicts driver's mandatory and discretionary lane-changing behaviours using a set of suitable machine learning techniques. Input features are objectively selected using the technique of Recursive Feature Elimination, and standard classification metrics are employed to select the best model. By accounting for class imbalance, this study finds that the Extra Trees classifier outperforms other machine learning techniques as well as a conventional utility theory-based model in predicting lane-changing behaviour. Furthermore, by keeping the model hyperparameters unchanged, this classifier shows good transferability in predicting lane-changing behaviour when tested on a completely new dataset. Finally, through explainable artificial intelligence, the output of the Extra Trees classifier is interpreted. The findings of this study advocate the use of machine learning techniques in future studies for explaining and predicting lane-changing behaviour. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies,145,,,,10.1016/j.trc.2022.103931,,#5521,Ali 2022,,,0
"Fabulation, Machine Agents, and Spiritually Authorizing Encounters","Loewen-Colón, J.; Mosurinjohn, S.C.","This paper uses a Tavesian model of religious experience to make a modest theorization about the role of “fabulation”, an embodied and affective process, to understand how some contemporary AI and robotics designers and users consider encounters with these technologies to be spiritually “authorizing”. By “fabulation”, we mean the Bergsonian concept of an evolved capacity that allows humans to see the potentialities of complex action within another object—in other words, an interior agential image, or “soul”; and by “authorizing”, we mean “deemed as having some claim to arbitration, persuasion, and legitimacy” such that the user might make choices that affect their life or others in accordance with the AI or might have their spiritual needs met. We considered two case studies where this agency took on a spiritual or religious valence when contextualized as such for the user: a robotic Buddhist priest known as Mindar, and a chatbot called The Spirituality Chatbot. We show how understanding perceptions of AI or robots as being spiritual or religious in a way that authorizes behavioral changes requires understanding tendencies of the human body more so than it does any metaphysical nature of the technology itself. © 2022 by the authors.

Use of artificial intelligence to enable dark nudges by transnational food and beverage companies: analysis of company documents,"Brooks, R.; Nguyen, D.; Bhatti, A.; Allender, S.; Johnstone, M.; Lim, C.P.; Backholer, K.","Objective: To describe the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled dark nudges by leading global food and beverage companies to influence consumer behaviour. Design: The five most recent annual reports (ranging from 2014 to 2018 or 2015 to 2019, depending on the company) and websites from twelve of the leading companies in the global food and beverage industry were reviewed to identify uses of AI and emerging technologies to influence consumer behaviour. Uses of AI and emerging technologies were categorised according to the Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments (TIPPME) framework, a tool for categorising and describing nudge-type behaviour change interventions (which has also previously been used to describe dark nudge-type approaches used by the alcohol industry). Setting: Not applicable. Participants: Twelve leading companies in the global food and beverage industry. Results: Text was extracted from fifty-seven documents from eleven companies. AI-enabled dark nudges used by food and beverage companies included those that altered products and objects' availability (e.g. social listening to inform product development), position (e.g. decision technology and facial recognition to manipulate the position of products on menu boards), functionality (e.g. decision technology to prompt further purchases based on current selections) and presentation (e.g. augmented or virtual reality to deliver engaging and immersive marketing). Conclusions: Public health practitioners and policymakers must understand and engage with these technologies and tactics if they are to counter industry promotion of products harmful to health, particularly as investment by the industry in AI and other emerging technologies suggests their use will continue to grow.  © ",2022,,Public Health Nutrition,25,5,1291-1299,,10.1017/S1368980022000490,,#5523,Brooks 2022,,,0
Prediction of Human Behavior with TOPSIS,"Javanbakht, T.; Chakravorty, S.","The present paper proposes a new application of the prediction of human behavior using TOPSIS as an appropriate tool for data optimization. Our hypothesis was that the analysis of the candidates with this method was influenced by the change of their behavior. We found that the behavior change could occur in more than one time span when the behavior of two candidates changed simultaneously. One of the advantages of this study is that the pattern of the behavior change with time is predicted with this method. Another advantage is that the modifications in the TOPSIS algorithm have made the predictions independent from the need of changing the fuzzy membership degrees of the candidates. This is the first time that these modifications in this technique with a new application including the numerical analysis of cognitive date are reported. Our results can be used in cognitive science, experimental psychology, cognitive informatics and artificial intelligence. © 2022, Research Expansion Alliance (REA).

"Measuring adherence, acceptability and likability of an artificial-intelligence-based, gamified phone application to improve the quality of dietary choices of adolescents in Ghana and Vietnam: Protocol of a randomized controlled pilot test","Braga, B.C.; Arrieta, A.; Bannerman, B.; Doyle, F.; Folson, G.; Gangupantulu, R.; Hoang, N.T.; Huynh, P.N.; Koch, B.; McCloskey, P.; Tran, L.M.; Tran, T.H.T.; Truong, D.T.T.; Nguyen, P.H.; Hughes, D.; Gelli, A.","Unhealthy diets are a critical global concern while dietary measure methods are time consuming and expensive. There is limited evidence that phone-based interventions can improve nutrition data collection and dietary quality, especially for adolescents in developing countries. We developed an artificial-intelligence-based phone application called Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights (FRANI) to address these problems. FRANI can recognize foods in images, track food consumption, display statistics and use gamified nudges to give positive feedback on healthy food choice. This study protocol describes the design of new pilot studies aimed at measuring the feasibility (acceptability, adherence, and usability) of FRANI and its effects on the quality of food choice of adolescents in Ghana and Vietnam. In each country, 36 adolescents (12–18 years) will be randomly allocated into two groups: The intervention group with the full version of FRANI and the control group with the functionality limited to image recognition and dietary assessment. Participants in both groups will have their food choices tracked for four weeks. The control groups will then switch to the full version of FRANI and both groups will be tracked for a further 2 weeks to assess acceptability, adherence, and usability. Analysis of outcomes will be by intent to treat and differences in outcomes between intervention and control group will use Poisson and odds ratio regression models, accounting for repeated measures at individual levels. If deemed feasible, acceptable and usable, FRANI will address gaps in the literature and advance the nutrition field by potentially improving the quality of food choices of adolescent girls in developing countries. This pilot study will also provide insights on the design of a large randomized controlled trial. The functioning and dissemination of FRANI can be an important step towards highly scalable nutrition data collection and healthier food choices for a population at risk of malnutrition.

The effect of gender stereotypes on artificial intelligence recommendations,"Ahn, J.; Kim, J.; Sung, Y.","This study explores the effects of gender stereotypes on evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations. We predict that gender stereotypes will affect human-AI interactions, resulting in somewhat different persuasive effects of AI recommendations for utilitarian vs. hedonic products. We found that participants in the male AI agent condition gave higher competence scores than in the female AI agent condition. Contrariwise, perceived warmth was higher in the female AI agent condition than in the male condition. More importantly, a significant interaction effect between AI gender and product type was found, suggesting that participants showed more positive attitudes toward the AI recommendations when the male AI recommended a utilitarian (vs. hedonic) product. Conversely, a hedonic product was evaluated more positively when advised by the female (vs. male) AI agent. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",2022,,Journal of Business Research,141,,50-59,,10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.12.007,,#5535,Ahn 2022,,,0
Human Mobility-Based Features to Analyse the Impact of COVID-19 on Power System Operation of Ireland,"Zarbakhsh, N.; Misaghian, M.S.; McArdle, G.","COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are changing human mobility patterns; however, the effects on power systems remain unclear. Previous loads and timings along with weather features are often used in literature as input features in load forecasting, but these may be insufficient during COVID-19. As a result, this paper proposes an analytical framework to assess the impact of COVID-19 on power system operation as well as day-ahead electricity prices in Ireland. To improve peak demand forecasting during pandemics, we incorporate mobility, NPIs, and COVID-19 cases as complementary input features and representative of human behaviour changes. By defining different combinations of these explanatory features, several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied and their performance is compared with the baseline scenario currently used in the literature. Using SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we interpret the best performing model, Light Gradient Boosted Machine, to determine the influence of each feature on the predicted outcomes. We discover that typical load forecasting features still influence ML outcomes the most, but mobility-related changes are also significant. Our finding shows that NPIs impact human behaviour and electricity consumption during times of crisis and can be used in the context of load forecasting to assist policymakers and energy distributors.  © 2020 IEEE.",2022,,IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy,9,,213-225,,10.1109/OAJPE.2022.3155960,,#5536,Zarbakhsh 2022,,,0
“I Will Follow You!” - How Recommendation Modality Impacts Processing Fluency and Purchase Intention,"Schwede, M.; Janson, A.; Zierau, N.; Hammerschmidt, M.; Leimeister, J.M.","Although conversational agents (CA) are increasingly used for providing purchase recommendations, important design questions remain. Across two experiments we examine with a novel fluency mechanism how recommendation modality (speech vs. text) shapes recommendation evaluation (persuasiveness and risk), the intention to follow the recommendation, and how modality interacts with the style of recommendation explanation (verbal vs. numerical). Findings provide robust evidence that text-based CAs outperform speech-based CAs in terms of processing fluency and consumer responses. They show that numerical explanations increase processing fluency and purchase intention of both recommendation modalities. The results underline the importance of processing fluency for the decision to follow a recommendation and highlight that processing fluency can be actively shaped through design decisions in terms of implementing the right modality and aligning it with the optimal explanation style. For practice, we offer actionable implications on how to make effective sales agents out of CAs. © 2022 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2022: ""Digitization for the Next Generation"".

Responsible nudging for social good: new healthcare skills for AI-driven digital personal assistants,"Capasso, M.; Umbrello, S.","Traditional medical practices and relationships are changing given the widespread adoption of AI-driven technologies across the various domains of health and healthcare. In many cases, these new technologies are not specific to the field of healthcare. Still, they are existent, ubiquitous, and commercially available systems upskilled to integrate these novel care practices. Given the widespread adoption, coupled with the dramatic changes in practices, new ethical and social issues emerge due to how these systems nudge users into making decisions and changing behaviours. This article discusses how these AI-driven systems pose particular ethical challenges with regards to nudging. To confront these issues, the value sensitive design (VSD) approach is adopted as a principled methodology that designers can adopt to design these systems to avoid harming and contribute to the social good. The AI for Social Good (AI4SG) factors are adopted as the norms constraining maleficence. In contrast, higher-order values specific to AI, such as those from the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, are adopted as the values to be promoted as much as possible in design. The use case of Amazon Alexa's Healthcare Skills is used to illustrate this design approach. It provides an exemplar of how designers and engineers can begin to orientate their design programs of these technologies towards the social good. © 2021, The Author(s).",2022,,"Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy",25,1,Nov-22,,10.1007/s11019-021-10062-z,,#5538,Capasso 2022,,,0

Player Matching in a Persuasive Mobile Exergame: Towards Performance-Driven Collaboration and Adaptivity,"Oyebode, O.; Orji, R.","Persuasive technologies (PTs) for promoting physical activity (PA) have experienced widespread attention over the years. However, limited knowledge exists on how best to design and match individuals in cooperative or social-based physical activity PTs to achieve the best outcome. It is established that people in the same group influence each other’s behaviours. Although few group formation techniques have been proposed in the literature, none of these techniques consider individuals’ normal PA levels in the real-world prior to assigning them to groups as a dimension to inform group formation. In this paper, we propose a group formation approach called Performance-based User Matching (PUM) which is based on the hypothesis that assigning users with similar PA levels to the same group (SG) will increase motivation and collective performance, compared to grouping users with dissimilar or mixed PA levels (MG). We empirically validated this approach in an exergaming context by conducting a 6-week field study using a persuasive exergame we developed to investigate and compare the SG and MG paradigms in terms of PA performance (step counts). Our findings show that players in the SG groups significantly increased their PA levels compared to those in the MG groups. Also, players in the SG groups individually and collectively exceeded their baseline steps during the intervention period, compared to those in the MG groups. Our findings hold promises for adaptive user matching and socially-driven persuasive applications design. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13213 LNCS,,164-173,,10.1007/978-3-030-98438-0_13,,#5540,Oyebode 2022,,,0

Sub-optimal management of osteoporosis is an area suitable for digital health interventions. While fracture liaison services (FLSs) are proven to greatly improve care for people with osteoporosis, such services might benefit from technologies that enhance automation. The term ‘Digital Health’ covers a variety of different tools including clinical decision support systems, electronic medical record tools, patient decision aids, patient apps, education tools, and novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Within the scope of this review are AI solutions that use algorithms within health system registries to target interventions.

An Intelligent Chatbot for Negotiation Dialogues,"Chen, S.; Sun, Q.; Su, R.","In negotiation dialogue tasks, opponents may use various strategies. Such negotiations are challenging because our chatbot needs to be able to detect the behavior change and then to adapt its own policy accordingly. Moreover, instead of adopting stationary strategies, a more advanced opponent may demonstrate sophisticated behaviors by employing reasoning strategies to predict its opponent behavior. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel chatbot for negotiation dialogues, which leverages the predictive power of Bayesian policy reuse (BPR) and the recursive reasoning ability of theory of mind (ToM). BPR can help the chatbot efficiently detect strategies of an opponent and select the best response policy, and ToM can efficiently identify whether an opponent is using stationary or higher-level reasoning strategies to improve policy selection.

"The design, implementation and pilot application of an intelligent online proctoring system for online exams","Jia, J.; He, Y.","Purpose: The purpose of this study is to design and implement an intelligent online proctoring system (IOPS) by using the advantage of artificial intelligence technology in order to monitor the online exam, which is urgently needed in online learning settings worldwide. As a pilot application, the authors used this system in an authentic university online exam and checked the proctoring result. Design/methodology/approach: The IOPS adopts the B/S (Browser/Server) architecture. The server side is implemented with programming language C and Python and stores the identification data of all examinees and their important behavior change status, including facial expression, eye and mouth movement and speech. The browser side collects and analyzes multimodal data of the examinee writing the online test locally and transfers the examinee’s most important behavior status change data to the server. Real-time face recognition and voice detection are implemented with the support of open-source software. Findings: The system was integrated into a Web-based intelligent tutoring system for school mathematics education. As a pilot application, the system was also used for online proctored exam in an undergraduate seminar in Peking University during the epidemic period in 2020. The recorded log data show that all students concentrated themselves on the exam and did not leave the camera and did not speak. Originality/value: During the epidemic period of the novel coronavirus outbreak, almost all educational institutions in the world use online learning as the best way to maintain the teaching and learning schedule for all students. However, current online instruction platforms lack the function to prevent the learners from cheating in online exams and cannot guarantee the integrity and equality for all examinees as in traditional classroom exams. The literature review shows that the online proctoring system should become an important component of online exams to tackle the growing online cheating problem. Although such proctoring systems have been developed and put on the market, the practical usage of such systems in authentic exams and its effect have not been reported. Those systems are heavyweight and commercial product and cannot be freely used in education. The light-weight IOPS developed by the authors could meet the need for online exam as a stable and practical approach and could contribute to the growing online learning and distance learning. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",2022,,Interactive Technology and Smart Education,19,1,112-120,,10.1108/ITSE-12-2020-0246,,#5545,Jia 2022,,,0
How persuasive is AI-generated argumentation? An analysis of the quality of an argumentative text produced by the GPT-3 AI text generator,"Hinton, M.; Wagemans, J.H.M.","In this paper, we use a pseudo-algorithmic procedure for assessing an AI-generated text. We apply the Comprehensive Assessment Procedure for Natural Argumentation (CAPNA) in evaluating the arguments produced by an Artificial Intelligence text generator, GPT-3, in an opinion piece written for the Guardian newspaper. The CAPNA examines instances of argumentation in three aspects: their Process, Reasoning and Expression. Initial Analysis is conducted using the Argument Type Identification Procedure (ATIP) to establish, firstly, that an argument is present and, secondly, its specific type in terms of the argument classification framework of the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA). Procedural Questions are then used to test the acceptability of the argument in each of the three aspects. The analysis shows that while the arguments put forward by the AI text generator are varied in terms of their type and follow familiar patterns of human reasoning, they contain obvious weaknesses. From this we can conclude that the automated generation of persuasive, well-reasoned argumentation is a far more difficult task than the generation of meaningful language, and that if AI systems producing arguments are to be persuasive, they require a method of checking the plausibility of their own output.  © 2023 - The authors.

Exploring the phenomenon and ethical issues of AI paternalism in health apps,"Kühler, M.","Health apps, including consumer-oriented fitness apps, have two functions. They are supposed to monitor and promote users’ health, the latter by way of being an instance of persuasive technology. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for AI health apps, i.e., health apps that act more and more autonomously when it comes to analyzing users’ health data and arriving at tailor-made results on how to improve their health. Consequently, AI health apps seem to gain a paternalistic potential. This is a game-changer, for corresponding issues of paternalism can then no longer be traced back to human engineers. Instead, the paternalizing party just is the AI system. Hence, AI health apps lead to the novel issue of AI paternalism in health care. In this paper, I explore this novel phenomenon and its ethical implications. Firstly, I discuss from a critical perspective whether the notion of AI paternalism makes (conceptual) sense to begin with. Unsurprisingly, I argue that it does and how so. Secondly, I briefly indicate important ethical issues that AI paternalism in health apps raise and which need to be discussed in more detail in order to judge under which conditions (certain forms of) AI paternalism might be considered acceptable, if at all. © 2021 The Authors.

Analysis of the implications of the Moral Machine project as an implementation of the concept of coherent extrapolated volition for building clustered trust in autonomous machines,"Sołoducha, K.","In this paper, we focus on the analysis of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s concept of “coherent extrapolated volition” (CEV) as a response to the need for a post-conventional, persuasive morality that meets the criteria of active trust in the sense of Anthony Giddens, which could be used in the case of autonomous machines. Based on the analysis of the results of the Moral Machine project, we formulate some guidelines for transformation of the idea of a coherent extrapolated volition into the concept of a coherent, extrapolated and clustered volition. The argumentation used in the paper is intended to show that the idea of CEV transformed into its clustered version can be used to build a technically and socially efficient decision-making pattern database for autonomous machines. © 2022 Copernicus Center Press.

Differentiating persuasive factors for tourism booking websites: Towards matrix factorization,"Lee, C.-S.; Wong, Y.-O.; Gui, H.-Y.","The main challenges to increasing sales, usually lie with persuasion techniques and recommender systems. Persuasion Systems models (PSDs) analyse persuasion context, identifies the key issues and subsequently, enables mapping of persuasion techniques to functional requirements. This paper investigates persuasive factors for tourism booking websites, with the aim of utilizing derived significant factors at different stages, as the bases for weighted criteria analyses, and matrix factorization, integral in fuzzy logic computations. Two parallel case studies are carried out. The first tourism booking website is designed, based on Cialdini's persuasion techniques for the Malaysian hotel/tourism context, and tested with customers and travel agencies. The second study investigates social CRM and associations between gender, age and income on a group of different sample respondents. User evaluation indicates different weighted factors at the search, review and booking stages, as well as different perceptions, with regards to cross-selling. Comparative findings with successful cross-selling companies, such as Lazada and Shoppee further highlight three core influencing factors. These have enabled us to add specificity to some constructs in Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa's PSD dialogue support model, for the sampled Malaysian contexts. This triangulated approach can enable more holistic derivation of requirements and prediction and derivation of initial rules for future decision support systems.  © 2022 IEEE.",2022,,"Proceedings - 2022 22nd International Conference on Computational Science and Its Applications, ICCSA 2022",,,01-Aug,,10.1109/ICCSA57511.2022.00011,,#5552,Lee 2022,,,0
‘That would have been the perfect thing after diagnosis’: development of a digital lifestyle management application in multiple sclerosis,"Krause, N.; Riemann-Lorenz, K.; Rahn, A.C.; Pöttgen, J.; Köpke, S.; Meyer, B.; Thale, F.; Temmes, H.; van de Loo, M.; Gold, S.M.; Heesen, C.","Background: A multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis urges decision-making on immunotherapies, while persons with MS (PwMS) need to develop a coping concept in parallel. At this stage, PwMS ask how they themselves may contribute to controlling the disease. Evidence suggests that maintaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g. physical activity and stress management) is a key factor for healthy aging and preserving activity, while data on MS are complex. Objectives: Following the Medical Research Council framework, this study aimed to develop and investigate the feasibility of a new digital health application that conveys evidence-based patient information about lifestyle factors in MS and engages PwMS in relevant behaviour change techniques. Methods: Based on a digital health application promoting lifestyle management in breast cancer survivors, an MS-specific adaptation (‘levidex’) was developed. Feasibility was tested with 15 PwMS and eight MS experts. Subsequently, a six-week pilot study with eight PwMS was conducted. All participants provided feedback on practicability and acceptability via a questionnaire and took part in a semi-structured telephone interview. Levidex was revised after each test phase. Results: The final levidex tool includes 16 modules, 177 references and several other functions. Feasibility results showed that PwMS and MS experts perceived levidex as understandable (14 out of 15; 6 out of 8), trustworthy (15 out of 15; 8 out of 8), and relevant (10 out of 15; 8 out of 8). Interviews revealed potential for improvement regarding the length and complexity of some content. Piloting of the revised version confirmed good feasibility and high acceptance. Most participants felt inspired to initiate (7 out of 8) or had already implemented (5 out of 8) lifestyle changes after working with levidex. Conclusion: Results suggest that levidex is feasible and well-accepted by PwMS and MS experts. It might be a useful tool to support PwMS in adapting to their diagnosis and initiating health-promoting lifestyle changes. © The Author(s), 2022.",2022,,Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders,15,,,,10.1177/17562864221118729,,#5553,Krause 2022,,,0
User-Centered Design of A Novel Risk Prediction Behavior Change Tool Augmented With an Artificial Intelligence Engine (MyDiabetesIQ): A Sociotechnical Systems Approach,"Shields, C.; Cunningham, S.G.; Wake, D.J.; Fioratou, E.; Brodie, D.; Philip, S.; Conway, N.T.","Background: Diabetes and its complications account for 10% of annual health care spending in the United Kingdom. Digital health care interventions (DHIs) can provide scalable care, fostering diabetes self-management and reducing the risk of complications. Tailorability (providing personalized interventions) and usability are key to DHI engagement/effectiveness. User-centered design of DHIs (aligning features to end users’ needs) can generate more usable interventions, avoiding unintended consequences and improving user engagement. Objective: MyDiabetesIQ (MDIQ) is an artificial intelligence engine intended to predict users’ diabetes complications risk. It will underpin a user interface in which users will alter lifestyle parameters to see the impact on their future risks. MDIQ will link to an existing DHI, My Diabetes My Way (MDMW). We describe the user-centered design of the user interface of MDIQ as informed by human factors engineering. Methods: Current users of MDMW were invited to take part in focus groups to gather their insights about users being shown their likelihood of developing diabetes-related complications and any risks they perceived from using MDIQ. Findings from focus groups informed the development of a prototype MDIQ interface, which was then user-tested through the “think aloud” method, in which users speak aloud about their thoughts/impressions while performing prescribed tasks. Focus group and think aloud transcripts were analyzed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive analysis. For think aloud data, a sociotechnical model was used as a framework for thematic analysis. Results: Focus group participants (n=8) felt that some users could become anxious when shown their future complications risks. They highlighted the importance of easy navigation, jargon avoidance, and the use of positive/encouraging language. User testing of the prototype site through think aloud sessions (n=7) highlighted several usability issues. Issues included confusing visual cues and confusion over whether user-updated information fed back to health care teams. Some issues could be compounded for users with limited digital skills. Results from the focus groups and think aloud workshops were used in the development of a live MDIQ platform. Conclusions: Acting on the input of end users at each iterative stage of a digital tool’s development can help to prioritize users throughout the design process, ensuring the alignment of DHI features with user needs. The use of the sociotechnical framework encouraged the consideration of interactions between different sociotechnical dimensions in finding solutions to issues, for example, avoiding the exclusion of users with limited digital skills. Based on user feedback, the tool could scaffold good goal setting, allowing users to balance their palatable future complications risk against acceptable lifestyle changes. Optimal control of diabetes relies heavily on self-management. Tools such as MDMW/ MDIQ can offer personalized support for self-management alongside access to users’ electronic health records, potentially helping to delay or reduce long-term complications, thereby providing significant reductions in health care costs. © Cathy Shields, Scott G Cunningham, Deborah J Wake, Evridiki Fioratou, Doogie Brodie, Sam Philip, Nicholas T Conway.

Research on Human Behavior Modeling of Sports Culture Communication in Industrial 4.0 Intelligent Management,"Li, Z.","With the advent of the information age, Internet technology and computer technology are gradually applied in various fields. Human daily life is inseparable from the help of information technology. The progress and development of the times are also changing our industrial environment. The Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and digital production have been widely used in the industrial field. We need to integrate the new intelligent management concept in the industrial 4.0 era into the modern industrial system and media communication. In the communication of sports culture, how to integrate the intelligent technology under the background of industry 4.0 and realize the spatiotemporal modeling and analysis of human behavior and behavior characteristics is the main content of our research. Firstly, this study briefly analyzes the development and historical process of industry 4.0 era and explores the impact of Internet of things and information technology on sports culture communication. This study analyzes the development process of Chinese sports culture communication and probes into the influence and significance of sports culture communication on human behavior. Under the background of industrial 4.0 management, a model of human temporal and spatial behavior change in sports culture communication is established. Human behavior trajectory is analyzed by data mining, human behavior recognition algorithm, behavior quantitative analysis method, and behavior feature model. The results show that under the background of industry 4.0 management, human behavior modeling can clearly describe the basic characteristics and behavior state in the process of sports culture communication and can predict and analyze the human behavior performance of such social activities and phenomena. Through data mining, data preprocessing, and behavior quantitative analysis, human behavior trajectory is studied. It has a positive impact on the behavior trend in human daily life. The main factor affecting behavior change is whether to receive sports culture news. © 2022 Zhihui Li.",2022,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022,,,,10.1155/2022/9818226,,#5558,Li 2022,,,0
The Intelligent Phenotypic Plasticity Platform (IP3) for Precision Medicine-Based Injury Prevention in Sport,"Kiefer, A.W.; Armitano-Lago, C.N.; Sathyan, A.; MacPherson, R.; Cohen, K.; Silva, P.L.","The best predictor of future injury is previous injury and this has not changed in a quarter century despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Regardless of formal care, these athletes remain two to four times more likely to suffer a second injury for several years after RTP. In the case of children and young adults, this sets them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. Thus, the initial injury is the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs, and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. This chapter details the technologies and method that make up the automated Intelligent Phenotypic Plasticity Platform (IP3)—a revolutionary new approach to the current standard of post-injury care that identifies and targets deficits that underly second injury risk in sport. IP3 capitalizes on the biological concept of phenotypic plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments, and it is implemented in two distinct steps: (1) phenomic profiling and (2) precision treatment. Phenomic profiling indexes the fitness and subsequent phenotypic plasticity of an individual athlete, which drives the personalization of the precision treatment step. IP3 leverages mixed-reality technologies to present true-to-life environments that test the athlete’s ability to adapt to dynamic stressors. The athlete’s phenotypic plasticity profile is then used to drive a precision treatment that systematically stresses the athlete, via a combination of behavioral-based and genetic fuzzy system models, to optimally enhance the athlete’s functional adaptability. IP3 is computationally light-weight and, through the integration with mixed-reality technologies, promotes real-time prediction, responsiveness, and adaptation. It is also the first ever phenotypic plasticity-based precision medicine platform, and the first precision sports medicine platform of any kind. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2022,,Methods in Molecular Biology,2393,,877-903,,10.1007/978-1-0716-1803-5_47,,#5561,Kiefer 2022,,,0
Cyanobacterial Blooms: Current Knowledge and New Perspectives,"Moreira, C.; Vasconcelos, V.; Antunes, A.","Cyanobacteria are ancient prokaryotes responsible for bloom formation in many freshwater resources worldwide.

With a global distribution, recent data highlight the impacts of climate change on CyanoBlooms occurrence, namely through the rise of temperature and nutrient input from storms and heavy rainfall. With current worldwide regulations based on the enumeration of the nutrient input of freshwater ecosystems, the increase in field monitoring regarding CyanoBlooms occurrence is demanded since evaluation of this parameter may conceal these massive agglomerations resulting in human health episodes and cyanotoxin outbreaks. © 2022 by the authors.",2022,,Earth (Switzerland),3,1,127-135,,10.3390/earth3010010,,#5562,Moreira 2022,,,0

A Novel Diagnostic Decision Support System for Medical Professionals: Prospective Feasibility Study,"Timiliotis, J.; Blumke, B.; Serfozo, P.D.; Gilbert, S.; Ondresik, M.; Turk, E.; Hirsch, M.C.; Eckstein, J.","Background: Continuously growing medical knowledge and the increasing amount of data make it difficult for medical professionals to keep track of all new information and to place it in the context of existing information. A variety of digital technologies and artificial intelligence-based methods are currently available as persuasive tools to empower physicians in clinical decision-making and improve health care quality. A novel diagnostic decision support system (DDSS) prototype developed by Ada Health GmbH with a focus on traceability, transparency, and usability will be examined more closely in this study. Objective: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and functionality of a novel DDSS prototype, exploring its potential and performance in identifying the underlying cause of acute dyspnea in patients at the University Hospital Basel. Methods: A prospective, observational feasibility study was conducted at the emergency department (ED) and internal medicine ward of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. A convenience sample of 20 adult patients admitted to the ED with dyspnea as the chief complaint and a high probability of inpatient admission was selected. A study physician followed the patients admitted to the ED throughout the hospitalization without interfering with the routine clinical work. Routinely collected health-related personal data from these patients were entered into the DDSS prototype. The DDSS prototype's resulting disease probability list was compared with the gold-standard main diagnosis provided by the treating physician. Results: The DDSS presented information with high clarity and had a user-friendly, novel, and transparent interface. The DDSS prototype was not perfectly suited for the ED as case entry was time-consuming (1.5-2 hours per case). It provided accurate decision support in the clinical inpatient setting (average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was the first diagnosis listed: 6/20, 30%, SD 2.10%; average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was listed as one of the top 3: 11/20, 55%, SD 2.39%; average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was listed as one of the top 5: 14/20, 70%, SD 2.26%) in patients with dyspnea as the main presenting complaint. Conclusions: The study of the feasibility and functionality of the tool was successful, with some limitations. Used in the right place, the DDSS has the potential to support physicians in their decision-making process by showing new pathways and unintentionally ignored diagnoses. The DDSS prototype had some limitations regarding the process of data input, diagnostic accuracy, and completeness of the integrated medical knowledge. The results of this study provide a basis for the tool's further development. In addition, future studies should be conducted with the aim to overcome the current limitations of the tool and study design. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

GLoHBCD: A Naturalistic German Dataset for Language of Health Behaviour Change on Online Support Forums,"Meyer, S.; Elsweiler, D.","Health behaviour change is a difficult and prolonged process that requires sustained motivation and determination. Conversational agents have shown promise in supporting the change process in the past. One therapy approach that facilitates change and has been used as a framework for conversational agents is motivational interviewing. However, existing implementations of this therapy approach lack the deep understanding of user utterances that is essential to the spirit of motivational interviewing. To address this lack of understanding, we introduce the GLoHBCD, a German dataset of naturalistic language around health behaviour change. Data was sourced from a popular German weight loss forum and annotated using theoretically grounded motivational interviewing categories. We describe the process of dataset construction and present evaluation results.

Predicting healthcare-seeking behavior based on stated readiness to act: Development and validation of a prediction model,"Green, E.P.; Pradheep, S.; Heinzelman, J.; Nyanchoka, A.; Achieng, D.; Goyal, S.; Cusson, L.; Kurz, A.S.; Bellows, B.","A starting point of many digital health interventions informed by the Stages of Change Model of behavior change is assessing a person's readiness to change. In this paper, we use the concept of readiness to develop and validate a prediction model of health-seeking behavior in the context of family planning. We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected, anonymized health data submitted by 4,088 female users of a free health chatbot in Kenya. We developed a prediction model of (future) self-reported action by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets (80/20, stratified by the outcome). We further split the training data into 10 folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step in model selection. We fit nine different classification models and selected the model that maximized the area under the receiver operator curve. We then fit the selected model to the full training dataset and evaluated the performance of this model on the holdout test data. The model predicted who will visit a family planning provider in the future with high precision (0.93) and moderate recall (0.75). Using the Stages of Change framework, we concluded that 29% of women were in the ""Preparation""stage, 21% were in the ""Contemplation""stage, and 50% were in the ""Pre-Contemplation""stage.

When E-Commerce Personalization Systems Show and Tell: Investigating the Relative Persuasive Appeal of Content-Based versus Collaborative Filtering,"Liao, M.; Sundar, S.S.","In the e-commerce context, are we persuaded more by a product recommendation that matches our preferences (content filtering) or by one that is endorsed by others like us (collaborative filtering)? We addressed this question by conceptualizing these two filtering types as cues that trigger cognitive heuristics (mental shortcuts), following the heuristic-systematic model in social psychology. In addition, we investigated whether the degree to which the recommendation matches user preferences (or other users’ endorsements) provides an argument for systematic processing, especially for those who need deeper insights into the accuracy of the algorithm, particularly in product categories where quality is subjective. Data from a 2 (algorithm type: content vs. collaborative filtering) x 3 (percentage match: low vs. medium vs. high) x 2 (product category: search vs. experience) + 2 (control: search and experience) between-subjects experiment (N = 469) reveal that for experience products, consumers prefer content-based filtering with higher percentage matches, because it is perceived as offering more transparency. This is especially true for individuals with high need for cognition. For search products, however, collaborative filtering leads to more positive evaluations by triggering the “bandwagon effect.” These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence in strategic communications and design of algorithms for e-commerce recommender systems. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising.",2022,,Journal of Advertising,51,2,256-267,,10.1080/00913367.2021.1887013,,#5574,Liao 2022,,,0
Behavioral Nudges as Patient Decision Support for Medication Adherence: The ENCOURAGE Randomized Controlled Trial,"Horne, B.D.; Muhlestein, J.B.; Lappé, D.L.; May, H.T.; Le, V.T.; Bair, T.L.; Babcock, D.; Bride, D.; Knowlton, K.U.; Anderson, J.L.","Background: Medication adherence is generally low and challenging to address because patient actions control healthcare delivery outside of medical environments. Behavioral nudging changes clinician behavior, but nudging patient decision-making requires further testing. This trial evaluated whether behavioral nudges can increase statin adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC). Methods: In a 12-month parallel-group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, adult patients in Intermountain Healthcare cardiology clinics were enrolled. Inclusion required an indication for statins and membership in SelectHealth insurance. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to control or nudges. Nudge content, timing, frequency, and delivery route were personalized by CareCentra using machine learning of subject motivations and abilities from psychographic assessment, demographics, social determinants, and the Intermountain Mortality Risk Score. PDC calculation used SelectHealth claims data. Results: Among 182 subjects, age averaged 63.2±8.5 years, 25.8% were female, baseline LDL-C was 82.5±32.7 mg/dL, and 93.4% had coronary disease. Characteristics were balanced between nudge (n = 89) and control arms (n = 93). The statin PDC was greater at 12 months in the nudge group (PDC: 0.742±0.318) compared to controls (PDC: 0.639±0.358, P = 0.042). Adherent subjects (PDC ≥80%) were more concentrated in the nudge group (66.3% vs controls: 50.5%, P = 0.036) while a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization was non-significant (nudges: 6.7% vs control: 10.8%, P = 0.44). Conclusions: Persuasive behavioral nudges driven by artificial intelligence resulted in a clinically important increase in statin adherence in general cardiology patients. This precision patient decision support utilized computerized nudge design and delivery with minimal on-going human input. © 2021 The Author(s)",2022,,American Heart Journal,244,,125-134,,10.1016/j.ahj.2021.11.001,,#5575,Horne 2022,,,0
Missing Mechanisms of Manipulation in the EU AI Act,"Franklin, M.; Ashton, H.; Gorman, R.; Armstrong, S.","The European Union Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act proposes to ban AI systems that ”manipulate persons through subliminal techniques or exploit the fragility of vulnerable individuals, and could potentially harm the manipulated individual or third person”. This article takes the perspective of cognitive psychology to analyze and understand what algorithmic manipulation consists of, who vulnerable individuals may be, and what is considered as harm. Subliminal techniques are expanded with concepts from behavioral science and the study of preference change. Individual psychometric differences which can be exploited are used to expand the concept of vulnerable individuals. The concept of harm is explored beyond physical and psychological harm to consider harm to one’s time and right to an un-manipulated opinion.

A unified health algorithm that teaches itself to improve health outcomes for every individual: How far into the future is it?,"Laroia, G.; Horne, B.D.; Esplin, S.; Ramaswamy, V.K.","The single biggest factor driving health outcomes is patient behavior. The CHR Model (County Health Rankings Model) weights socioeconomic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and physical environment factors collectively at 80% in driving impact on health outcomes, to the 20% weight for access to and quality of clinical care. Commercial determinants of health affect everyone today and unhealthy choices worsen pre-existing economic, social, and racial inequities. Yet there is a disproportionate focus on therapeutic intervention to the exclusion of shaping patient behaviors to improve healthcare. If the recent pandemic taught us a critically important lesson, it is the imperative to look beyond clinical care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), long-standing systemic health and social inequities put various groups of people at higher risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, including many racial and ethnic minority groups. The virus was simply more efficient in detecting such vulnerabilities than the guardians of these physiologies. These insights from the pandemic come at the heel of a confluence of three major accelerants that may radically reshape our approaches to hot-spotting vulnerabilities and managing them before they manifest in a derangement or disease. They are the recent strides in behavioral economics and behavior science; advances in remote monitoring and personal health technologies; and developments in artificial intelligence and data sciences. These accelerants allow us to imagine a previously impossible vision—we can now build and maintain a unified health algorithm for every individual that can dynamically track the two interdependent streams of risk, clinical and behavioral. © The Author(s) 2022.",2022,,Digital Health,8,,,,10.1177/20552076221074126,,#5578,Laroia 2022,,,0

"Perceptions of Interactive, Real-Time Persuasive Technology for Managing Online Gambling","Arden-Close, E.; Bolat, E.; Vuillier, L.; Ali, R.","Background: Interactive persuasive techniques, supported by the ability to retrieve real-time behaviour and other contextual data, offer an unprecedented opportunity to manage online activity. An example is Responsible Gambling (RG) tools. Currently, despite vast potential, they do not make use of real time gambling behaviour data, whether captured by operators (device, location, bets, limits set) or self-reported (finance, emotion, online browsing history). To design useful interactive persuasive tools, it is important to understand users’ perceptions to ensure maximum acceptance. Aims: Explore gamblers’ perceptions of the potential of future online platforms in providing data-driven, real-time, persuasive interventions for supporting responsible online gambling. Method: Qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 gamblers (80% men; 15 ex-problem, 7 current), regarding perceptions of the potential of persuasive techniques. Results: Thematic analysis showed participants were positive about data-driven, real-time, interactive technology for (i) providing information (educational, personal and comparative), (ii) limiting gambling (time and money spent, access to gambling operators) and (iii) providing support to gamblers (advice, feedback and context sensing). The technology was identified as most appropriate for low to moderate gamblers. Conclusions: Participants were positive about the new data access, techniques and modalities of interactions for supporting responsible online gambling. To ensure maximum reach and acceptability, such technology should be customised to fit individual profiles. Personalisation and tailoring of content, interactivity, framing and timing are necessary to enhance acceptance of such technology and avoid reactance, unintended harm, inconvenience, and information overload. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13213 LNCS,,28-42,,10.1007/978-3-030-98438-0_3,,#5580,Arden-Close 2022,,,0
Designing a Deep Learning Hybrid Using CNN and Inception V3 Transfer Learning to Detect the Aggression Level of Deep Obsessive Compulsive Disorder in Children,"Madanan, M.; Sayed, B.T.","The usage of Artificial intelligence in; medical arena has proved to be a game changer in the detection and diagnosis of several medical conditions. In the current digital era, children with stressful medical issues are suffering from Deep Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (DOCD). This kind of mental stress occurs in children because of the continuous usage of gadgets such as mobile phone, playing games using play stations, watching videos on tablets, etc. In most of the possibilities, single children are the ones affected with several obsessions such as stubborn activities, fighting for selfish priorities and so on. In medical terms, these kinds of complex behavioral changes are identified as DOCD. Genetic behaviors sometimes in a few group of children are also noticed as a modality difference. As symptoms are psychiatric impairment, such a child remains isolated, abnormal silence, being obsessive and repeating irrelevant words, high stress or anxiety. All medical challenges could be treated as healthcare research metrics and the gradual increase in DOCD disorder among children of this generation can be considered too. Early detection of DOCD is essential as it can help in early diagnosis but techniques to do so is unavailable currently. Deep learning-an artificial intelligence method can be utilized to detect DOCD, diagnose and treat it and bring about a positive character in children. Behavior changes in children can be classified and detected using transfer learning algorithms. In COVID-19 pandemic situation, 3% of DOCD has increased to 10-15% as a disorder. This information is retrieved from children by monitoring negative activities, unusual behavior such as nail biting, removing spectacles and placing them in the wrong place, watching tablets, mobile phones and television for more hours. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), input such as MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) is used for experimenting the variations in behavior with the high dimension that are analyzed from the image dataset. Using Transfer Learning with Inception V3-, CNN generalization of misophonia level can be statistically analyzed to avoid overfitting problems. By employing AI techniques, the aggression level can be predicted using data augmentation method with better accuracy and a low error rate than the existing systems. In the research it is observed that using the model employing Inception-V3 transfer learning CNN a better prediction of aggression levels can be achieved in comparison to the existing CNN model used. © 2022 North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

Governing Ethical AI Transformation: A Case Study of AuroraAI,"Leikas, J.; Johri, A.; Latvanen, M.; Wessberg, N.; Hahto, A.","How can the public sector use AI ethically and responsibly for the benefit of people? The sustainable development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector requires dialogue and deliberation between developers, decision makers, deployers, end users, and the public. This paper contributes to the debate on how to develop persuasive government approaches for steering the development and use of AI. We examine the ethical issues and the role of the public in the debate on developing public sector governance of socially and democratically sustainable and technology-intensive societies. To concretize this discussion, we study the co-development of a Finnish national AI program AuroraAI, which aims to provide citizens with tailored and timely services for different life situations, utilizing AI. With the help of this case study, we investigate the challenges posed by the development and use of AI in the service of public administration.

Modelling argumentation in short text: A case of social media debate,"Lytos, A.; Lagkas, T.; Sarigiannidis, P.; Argyriou, V.; Eleftherakis, G.","The technological leaps of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of machine learning have triggered significant progress in a plethora of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding tasks. One of these tasks is argumentation mining which has received significant interest in recent years and is regarded as a key domain for future decision-making systems, behaviour modelling, and natural language understanding problems. Until recently, natural language modelling tasks, such as computational argumentation schemes, were often tested in controlled environments, such as persuasive essays, reducing unexpected behaviours that could occur in real-life settings, like a public debate on social media. Additionally, the growing demand for enhancing the trust and the explainability of the AI services has dictated the design and adoption of modelling schemes to increase the confidence in the outcomes of the AI solutions. This paper attempts to explore modelling argumentation in short text and proposes a novel framework for argumentation detection under the name Abstract Framework for Argumentation Detection (AFAD). Moreover, different proof-of-concept implementations are provided to examine the applicability of the proposed framework to very short text developing a rule-based mechanism and compare the results with data-driven solutions. Eventually, a combination of the deployed methods is applied increasing the correct predictions in the minority class on an imbalanced dataset. The findings suggest that the modelling process provides solid grounds for technical research while the hybrid solutions have the potential to be applied to a wide range of NLP-related tasks offering a deeper understanding of human language and reasoning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",2022,,Simulation Modelling Practice and Theory,115,,,,10.1016/j.simpat.2021.102446,,#5586,Lytos 2022,,,0
Dialo-AP: A Dependency Parsing Based Argument Parser for Dialogues,"Saha, S.; Das, S.; Srihari, R.","While neural approaches to argument mining (AM) have advanced considerably, most of the recent work has been limited to parsing monologues. With an urgent interest in the use of conversational agents for broader societal applications, there is a need to advance the state-of-the-art in argument parsers for dialogues. This enables progress towards more purposeful conversations involving persuasion, debate and deliberation. This paper discusses Dialo-AP, an end-to-end argument parser that constructs argument graphs from dialogues. We formulate AM as dependency parsing of elementary and argumentative discourse units; the system is trained using extensive pre-training and curriculum learning comprising nine diverse corpora. Dialo-AP is capable of generating argument graphs from dialogues by performing all subtasks of AM. Compared to existing state-ofthe-art baselines, Dialo-AP achieves significant improvements across all tasks, which is further validated through rigorous human evaluation. © 2022 Proceedings - International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING.

NAFLD and NASH: The Metabolically Diseased Liver,"Armandi, A.; Schattenberg, J.M.","Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, with a global prevalence of approximately 24% in the general population. It is caused by fat accumulation in the liver secondary to insulin resistance, visceral obesity, and/or features of metabolic syndrome. A genetic susceptibility contributes to the phenotype, accounting for a more severe course of liver disease and the observed clinical variability. In fact, despite liver steatosis being considered a relatively benign entity, inflammation related to oxidative stress and lipid-derived damage may lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which constitutes the progressive disease. Accumulation of hepatic fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis and provide the environment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Obese and diabetic individuals represent a well-acknowledged high risk population. The assessment of liver fibrosis plays a crucial role in clinical setting, as liver-related mortality increases parallel to fibrosis stage. A liver biopsy is currently considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of NASH and the fibrosis stage, but many non-invasive tools are used with the aim of replacing histology for diagnosis and prognosis purposes. Blood based scores and liver stiffness are the most widely used and validated tools to assess liver fibrosis. Management of NAFLD resides on environmental interventions, including diet and physical activity to induce weight loss, and avoiding harmful nutrients, including fructose-sweetened beverages and high glycemic index foods, that are directly implied in liver injury. Multiple trials with investigational drugs are currently explored to treat fibrosing NASH, with promising results and it can be expected that a liver direct therapy aiming at steatohepatitis and fibrosis will become available soon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology,274,,253-267,,10.1007/164_2021_561,,#5590,Armandi 2022,,,0
Fuzzy Logic Decision Support System to Predict Peaches Marketable Period at Highest Quality,"Magalhães, B.; Gaspar, P.D.; Corceiro, A.; João, L.; Bumba, C.","Food waste occurs from harvesting to consumption. Applying procedures and technologies, changing attitudes, and promoting awareness have positive social, economic, and environmental impacts that can contribute to reducing food waste. The paper presents a decision support system (DSS) to predict the quality evolution of fruits and vegetables, particularly of peaches, and estimate its commercialization period at the highest overall perceived quality by consumers, thus contributing to reducing food waste. The Fuzzy Logic DSS predicts the evolution of the physical-chemical parameters of peaches (hardness, soluble solids content, and acidity) depending on the cultivar (Royal Summer and Royal Time), storage time, and temperature. As the range of the values of these physical-chemical parameters of peaches that consumers perceive to be at their highest quality are known, the DSS predicts the marketable period in days. Case studies were developed to analyze the influence of each physical-chemical parameter on the commercialization days (number and time to start). It is concluded that temperature is the most important parameter for fruit conservation. A low value of conservation temperature allows for the significant extension of the time that peaches can be sold at the highest quality. Hardness is used to determine the harvest date since it is an index of fruit ripeness. The same conclusion is obtained for the influence of the soluble solids content. The influence of acidity on marketable days is less than the other physical-chemical parameters. This DSS helps retailers to sell their peaches at the highest quality with benefits for all parties. It also helps in the decision-making concerning the actions to take when fruits are reaching the end of their highest quality by predicting the range of the commercialization days. This formulation can be extended to other fruits and vegetables and in the last instance contribute to the reduction of food loss and waste, consequently promoting social, economic, and environmental aspects of our daily life. © 2022 by the authors.

"Information Design for Multiple Independent and Self-Interested Defenders: Work Less, Pay Off More","Zhou, C.; Spivey, A.; Xu, H.; Nguyen, T.H.","This paper studies the problem of information design in a general security game setting in which multiple independent self-interested defenders attempt to provide protection simultaneously on the same set of important targets against an unknown attacker. A principal, who can be one of the defenders, has access to certain private information (i.e., attacker type) whereas other defenders do not. We investigate the question of how that principal, with additional private information, can influence the decisions of the defenders by partially and strategically revealing her information. In particular, we develop a polynomial-time ellipsoid algorithm to compute an optimal private signaling scheme. Our key finding is that the separation oracle in the ellipsoid approach can be carefully reduced to bipartite matching. Furthermore, we introduce a compact representation of any ex-ante persuasive signaling schemes by exploiting intrinsic security resource allocation structures, enabling us to compute an optimal scheme significantly faster. Our experiment results show that by strategically revealing private information, the principal can significantly enhance the protection effectiveness on the targets. © 2022 Proceedings of the 38th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2022.

An integrated fuzzy decision support system for analyzing challenges and pathways to promote green and climate smart mining,"Jiskani, I.M.; Cai, Q.; Zhou, W.; Lu, X.; Shah, S.A.A.","Green and climate smart mining (GCSM) is a recent advancement in mining that not only alleviates the exacerbating environmental and climate-related impacts but also protects the well-being of the communities in the mining regions. However, there is still a long way to transform current mining practices into GCSM due to many challenges hampering its implementation process. This study applied a three-phase systematic research approach to develop a decision support system to recognize and eradicate these challenges through persuasive strategic pathways. In the first phase, a combination of extensive literature review and the fuzzy Delphi method identifies 9 pathways to overcome 24 challenges divided into five broad categories. The second phase involves an integrated fuzzy decision analysis approach to rank all the challenges, explore their interrelationships, and prioritize the pathways. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is conducted for pathways prioritization against each of the five categories of challenges. The proposed system is illustrated by conducting a case study of the Chinese mining industry to verify its utility and applicability. Analysis unveiled challenges related to government and regulatory and technical and operational categories as the most critical to hamper GCSM implementation, which can be overcome through three best pathways, including low-interest loans and subsidies, cognitive development, and strict codes for newer enterprises. This research is a novel contribution to building connections between mining and sustainability science that provides a comprehensive insight for mining affiliated professionals to implement and promote GCSM, which has not yet been presented in the existing literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2022,,Expert Systems with Applications,188,,,,10.1016/j.eswa.2021.116062,,#5594,Jiskani 2022,,,0

Predicting Decisions in Language Based Persuasion Games,"Apel, R.; Erev, I.; Reichart, R.; Tennenholtz, M.","Sender-receiver interactions, and specifically persuasion games, are widely researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence, and serve as a solid foundation for powerful applications. However, in the classic persuasion games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the decision-maker are abstract or well-structured application-specific signals rather than natural (human) language messages, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion setups. This paper addresses the use of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact on the decisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the prediction of these decisions. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several scored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert, and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the review score distribution available to the expert only. The expert’s payoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker chooses the hotel. We also compare the behavioral patterns in this experiment to the equivalent patterns in similar experiments where the communication is based on the numerical values of the reviews rather than the reviews’ text, and observe substantial differences which can be explained through an equilibrium analysis of the game. We consider a number of modeling approaches for our verbal communication setup, differing from each other in the model type (deep neural network (DNN) vs. linear classifier), the type of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the source of the textual features (DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a sequential modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied. Further analysis of the hand-crafted textual features allows us to make initial observations about the aspects of text that drive decision making in our setup. © 2022 AI Access Foundation.

First, PWD must be able to access the tool and be adequately trained on the tool. Second, PWD must be able to receive feedback on tool use and data generated by the tool. Third, PWD should receive coaching on behavior change. Fourth, PWD must receive support for ongoing use of the tool. The availability of these tools has rapidly increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter will review the current evidence, barriers, and future directions for digital health and telehealth interventions in the context of behavior change. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Operationalizing Behavior Change Techniques in Conversational Agents,"Bastos, M.I.; Cláudio, A.P.; Félix, I.B.; Guerreiro, M.P.; Carmo, M.B.; Balsa, J.","Departing from previous work on the use of well-established behavior change techniques in an mHealth intervention based on a conversational agent (CA), we propose in this contribution a new architecture for the design of behavior change CAs. This novel approach combines the use of an advanced natural language platform (Dialogflow) with the explicit representation, in an ontology, of how behavior change techniques can be operationalized. The integration of these two components is explained, as well as the most challenging aspect of using the advanced features of the platform in a way that allowed the agent to lead the dialogue flow, when needed. A successful proof of concept was built, which can be the basis for the development of advanced conversational agents, combining natural language tools with ontology-based knowledge representation. © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

On the Benefits of Being Constrained When Receiving Signals,"Su, S.-T.; Kempe, D.; Subramanian, V.G.","We study a Bayesian persuasion setting in which the receiver is trying to match the (binary) state of the world. The sender’s utility is partially aligned with the receiver’s, in that conditioned on the receiver’s action, the sender derives higher utility when the state of the world matches the action. Our focus is on whether in such a setting, being constrained helps a receiver. Intuitively, if the receiver can only take the sender’s preferred action with smaller probability, the sender might have to reveal more information, so that the receiver can take the action more specifically when the sender prefers it. We show that with a binary state of the world, this intuition indeed carries through: under very mild non-degeneracy conditions, a more constrained receiver will always obtain (weakly) higher utility than a less constrained one. Unfortunately, without additional assumptions, the result does not hold when there are more than two states in the world, which we show with an explicit example. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13112 LNCS,,167-185,,10.1007/978-3-030-94676-0_10,,#5602,Su 2022,,,0
A Deep Learning Method for Intelligent Analysis of Sports Training Postures,"Sun, Y.; Li, Y.","With the further research of artificial intelligence technology, motion recognition technology is widely used in posture analysis of sports training. However, the interference of light, Angle, and distance in real life makes the existing model unable to focus on the expression of human movements. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a motion training attitude analysis method based on a multiscale spatiotemporal graph convolution network. Firstly, the spatiotemporal image of the skeleton is constructed, and then the convolution operation is performed on the spatiotemporal image of the skeleton. Finally, the convolution results are linearly weighted and fused to capture the characteristics of action types with different time lengths. At the same time, the algorithm increases the processing of some important information loss and increases the randomness of the data set. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to the behavior changes of different complexity, and the model performance and recognition accuracy are significantly improved.  © 2022 Yuqin Sun and Youliang Li.",2022,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,2022,,,,10.1155/2022/2442606,,#5603,Sun 2022,,,0
Detection of Face Mask: A Systematic Approach,"Jeevitha, R.; Subhashini, S.J.; Krishna, K.C.S.; Teja, K.V.; Srinivas, S.K.","The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is causing health crises around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing a face mask is an effective means of protection in public places. In most public gatherings such as shopping centers, theaters, parks, it is increasingly necessary to make sure that people in the crowd are wearing masks. Developing an artificial intelligence solution that determines regardless of whether an individual is wearing a cover and letting it in will be great help for the society. In this case, a simple face mask detection system is built using deep learning techniques such as machine learning and persuasive neural network. The model is built with machine learning and OpenCV libraries often used for real-time applications.

Player Personality Traits and the Effectiveness of a Persuasive Game for Disease Awareness Among the African Population,"Ndulue, C.; Orji, R.","Although persuasive gamified systems have been proven to be effective at motivating behaviour change in various domains of life, there are reoccurring research questions around the effectiveness of these systems for players with various user characteristics, cultures, and across various behaviour domains. Our paper explores the effectiveness of various persuasive strategies implemented in a persuasive game for disease awareness and prevention, specifically, persuasive games for creating awareness about COVID-19 among the African audience and the impact of user personality traits on the effectiveness of the strategies. An in-the-wild study among 51 Africans reveals that the 12 persuasive strategies implemented in the game were perceived as highly effective at motivating behaviour change overall. We also uncovered that people high in Agreeableness were motivated by eight of the strategies, while people high in Neuroticism were demotivated by the Self-Monitoring strategy. Agreeableness and Conscientiousness emerged as the personality traits that predicted most of the variability in the effectiveness of the persuasive strategies implemented in the game. Based on the findings and the qualitative comments, we provide design suggestions for implementing various persuasive strategies for different personality traits in the African population. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13213 LNCS,,134-144,,10.1007/978-3-030-98438-0_11,,#5605,Ndulue 2022,,,0
Digital Behavior Change Interventions for the Prevention and Management of Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Market Analysis,"Keller, R.; Hartmann, S.; Teepe, G.W.; Lohse, K.-M.; Alattas, A.; Car, L.T.; Müller-Riemenschneider, F.; von Wangenheim, F.; Mair, J.L.; Kowatsch, T.","Background: Advancements in technology offer new opportunities for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Venture capital companies have been investing in digital diabetes companies that offer digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). However, little is known about the scientific evidence underpinning such interventions or the degree to which these interventions leverage novel technology-driven automated developments such as conversational agents (CAs) or just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) approaches. Objective: Our objectives were to identify the top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes management and prevention, review the level of scientific evidence underpinning the DBCIs, identify which DBCIs are recognized as evidence-based programs by quality assurance authorities, and examine the degree to which these DBCIs include novel automated approaches such as CAs and JITAI mechanisms. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using 2 venture capital databases (Crunchbase Pro and Pitchbook) to identify the top-funded companies offering interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention and management. Scientific publications relating to the identified DBCIs were identified via PubMed, Google Scholar, and the DBCIs' websites, and data regarding intervention effectiveness were extracted. The Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was used to identify the recognition status. The DBCIs' publications, websites, and mobile apps were reviewed with regard to the intervention characteristics. Results: The 16 top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes received a total funding of US $2.4 billion as of June 15, 2021. Only 4 out of the 50 identified publications associated with these DBCIs were fully powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Further, 1 of those 4 RCTs showed a significant difference in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) outcomes between the intervention and control groups. However, all the studies reported HbA1c improvements ranging from 0.2% to 1.9% over the course of 12 months. In addition, 6 interventions were fully recognized by the DPRP to deliver evidence-based programs, and 2 interventions had a pending recognition status. Health professionals were included in the majority of DBCIs (13/16, 81%,), whereas only 10% (1/10) of accessible apps involved a CA as part of the intervention delivery. Self-reports represented most of the data sources (74/119, 62%) that could be used to tailor JITAIs. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the level of funding received by companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes prevention and management does not coincide with the level of evidence on the intervention effectiveness. There is considerable variation in the level of evidence underpinning the different DBCIs and an overall need for more rigorous effectiveness trials and transparent reporting by quality assurance authorities. Currently, very few DBCIs use automated approaches such as CAs and JITAIs, limiting the scalability and reach of these solutions. © Roman Keller, Sven Hartmann, Gisbert Wilhelm Teepe, Kim-Morgaine Lohse, Aishah Alattas, Lorainne Tudor Car, Falk Müller-Riemenschneider, Florian von Wangenheim, Jacqueline Louise Mair, Tobias Kowatsch.",2022,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,24,1,,,10.2196/33348,,#5606,Keller 2022,,,0
The Utility of Personality Types for Personalizing Persuasion,"Xu, W.; Ishikawa, Y.; Legaspi, R.","Existing research shows that it is effective for the persuader to personalize persuasion based on the persuadee’s personality. However, prior studies overlooked the interactions of multiple personality traits, which undermines the effectiveness of personalization. In this paper, we investigated the utility of personality types for predicting behavioral intention and personalizing persuasion. The personality types are constructed by categorizing subjects based on the interactions of their Big Five personality traits. Using these personality types as predictors, we then examined how they improved model fitting and prediction accuracy compared to personality traits. Specifically, we used the online survey data of 3,116 Japanese participants to build nine prediction models and confirmed that (1) personality type is a significant factor in personalizing strategies and predicting behavioral intention, and (2) personality types should be appropriately applied according to the prediction model’s complexity when personalizing persuasive strategies. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13213 LNCS,,240-254,,10.1007/978-3-030-98438-0_19,,#5607,Xu 2022,,,0
Effects of EEG-sleep irregularities and its behavioral aspects: review and analysis,"Satapathy, S.; Loganathan, D.; Bhoi, A.K.; Barsocchi, P.","Sleep is one of the most important areas for humans for maintaining daily activities with full concentration and attention. Maintaining the proper sleep patterns is strongly related to physical, mental, cognitive, and physiological well-being. On the other hand, poor sleep patterns may lead to several diseases, affecting both physiological and cognitive functions, which causes worsened general health conditions. For that reason, it is important to understand subjects' sleep behavior and analyzing changes in sleep characteristics has become one a research area, where the different major reasons and causes, which are directly or indirectly responsible for sleep deprivation, need to be identified. All these reasons increase the demands for a brief comparative analysis of the sleep monitoring system. This chapter mainly focuses on the different methods and procedures for analyzing sleep behavior changes in the different stages of sleep. The authors also briefly focus on how the age and gender of subjects may affect their sleep quality. The chapter also offers a systematic review of how artificial intelligence techniques make sleep stage classifications easier. Another important aspect of this chapter is a brief analysis of the different biosignals and their clinical characteristics to measure sleep irregularities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Efficacy of Emerging Technologies to Manage Childhood Obesity,"Alotaibi, M.; Alnajjar, F.; Cappuccio, M.; Khalid, S.; Alhmiedat, T.; Mubin, O.","Childhood obesity is a widespread medical condition and presents a formidable challenge for public health. Long-term treatment strategies and early prevention strategies are required because obese children are more likely to carry this condition into adulthood, increasing their risk of developing other major health disorders. The present review analyses various technological interventions available for childhood obesity prevention and treatment. It also examines whether machine learning and technological interventions can play vital roles in its management. Twenty-six studies were shortlisted for the review using various technological strategies and analysed regarding their efficacy. While most of the selected studies showed positive outcomes, there was a lack of studies using robots and artificial intelligence to manage obesity in children. The use of machine learning was observed in various studies, and the integration of social robots and other efficacious strategies may be effective for treating childhood obesity in the future. © 2022 Alotaibi et al.",2022,,"Diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity",15,,1227-1244,,10.2147/DMSO.S357176,,#5609,Alotaibi 2022,,,0

As the social capabilities and the persuasiveness of robots increase, the design of robot personality will become important. This paper investigates the impact of expressive motions on people's perception of robot personality. The framework of Laban Effort Features was implemented for a simple cleaning task. Movement features were programmed in iRobotCreate2, and participants were asked to rate the robot's personality in an online survey. The results indicated that Flow factor was closely associated with neuroticism ratings, Weight factor impacted both agreeableness and conscientiousness ratings, while Time factor impacted only the agreeableness ratings.

Evaluation and Analysis of the Intervention Effect of Systematic Parent Training Based on Computational Intelligence on Child Autism,"He, X.; Yu, Y.; Ouyang, Y.","Autism, also known as pervasive developmental disorder or autism spectrum disorder, is a group of clinical syndromes of developmental delay or impairment. Social impairment, verbal communication impairment, and behavioral impairment are the three conditions for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. According to relevant statistics, about 1 in 100 children is now diagnosed with autism, and their rehabilitation treatment is also valued by people from all walks of life. In the rehabilitation training of autistic children, it is found that the rehabilitation training of autistic children should pay attention to the role of parents and family environment. It is crucial that parents receive systematic training and act as partners in the development of the intervention plan. Research shows that a specific structured education and skills training program for parents of children with autism can be beneficial in improving behavioral problems, functional communication, and symptoms of autism in children with autism. To this end, this paper has completed the following work: Secondly, a portion of the systematic training of CA parents is discussed, followed by an explanation of the structure and principles of BPNN. Finally, the BPNN is utilized to create a model for assessing the impact of systematic parent instruction on CA.

Gamification and Newsgames as Narrative Innovations in Journalism,"García-Avilés, J.A.; Ferrer-Conill, R.; García-Ortega, A.","This chapter explores how innovative narratives, supported by a combination of playful approaches and technological convergence, provide a reconfiguration of digital news storytelling. Newsgames integrate two opposing logics: the culture of journalism, based on truthfulness and credibility, and the culture of games, characterized by the creation of imaginary worlds, persuasion and mechanics. We analyse The Ocean Game (2019) and The Amazon Race (2019), which use different procedural strategies. We examine the development of gamification in journalistic storytelling, which uses game elements to enhance the user experience. The relationship that gamified news products establish with the audience illuminates changes in the rhetorical and structural dynamics between the news organization, the media workers, and the users. Thus, innovation in journalistic narrative through gamification and newsgames might translate into effective ways of producing content that combines rigour in substance with attractiveness in form, while preserving journalistic quality and incorporating the playful elements of games. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Studies in Big Data,97,,53-67,,10.1007/978-3-030-88028-6_5,,#5622,García-Avilés 2022,,,0
Decision support system for evaluating the role of music in network-based game for sustaining effectiveness,"Yu, Y.; Wang, D.; Faisal, M.; Jabeen, F.; Johar, S.","The development of music in games brings attractiveness and spreads the gaming industry. Music plays a vital role in the games to attract user attitudes toward gaming. The gaming industry is more beneficial than any other industry, like the film industry using music in-game. The evolution of music in games started a few decades ago and brought a lot of enhancement in gaming. Nowadays, a player likes music-based games more than any other game because while playing music-based games, it releases stress and keeps comfortable of player’s mind. The music in games changes the previous gaming style and advances, which help the young generation, learn something new from different games. Music is used to attract user attitudes and ultimately involve users in gaming during playing games. Music is utilized in-game to develop a more attractive and memorable game to enhance users’ interest in playing games. In addition, the usage of background music in games is also a primary part of successful games because, at a similar time, game developers and those who play games hope that video games can be more persuasive. After studying the previous paper, it identified that music in games positively impacts players’ performance and achievement, improves the player’s skills, and keeps players relaxed during playing games.

Social Media Analytics and its Applications in Marketing,"Moon, S.; Iacobucci, D.","The rise of the Internet and smartphones in the 21st century has created and developed social media as an extremely effective means of communication in society. In life, business, sports, and politics, social media facilitates the democratization of ideas like never before. Social media content gives consumers different information sources that they must decipher to discern its trustworthiness and influence in their own opinions. Marketers must be savvy about using social media in their attempts to persuade consumers and build brand equity. As social media has permeated our everyday lives, scholars in various disciplines are actively conducting research into this aspect regarding our way of life. In this scholarly endeavor, marketing has taken a leading role in this research endeavor as a discipline involving human communications and idea persuasion. Thus, rather than considering social media broadly across multiple disciplines, in this monograph, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. This monograph comprises the following four sections: • First, we provide an overview of social media and social media analytics (SMA). While much has already been said about social media generally, relatively less has been said about social media analytics. Thus, much of our focus is on SMA in terms of contributing to the current understanding of SMA in the field. • Second, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. We discuss practical industry perspectives and examples, as well as recent marketing research by academics. Notably, we show how analytics may be used to address concerns about social media privacy and help detect fake reviews. • Third, we summarize common tools for social media analytics in marketing. These methods can be complex, but they must be mastered for sound SMA practice. They encompass big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and visual analytics. • Fourth, we discuss trends and a future research agenda. We also discuss how SMA might be better integrated into higher education. © 2022 S. Moon and D.

"Methods in Digital Mental Health: Smartphone-Based Assessment and Intervention for Stress, Anxiety, and Depression","Kolenik, T.","Technological embeddedness into everyday life and interconnectivity between omnipresent devices, termed the Internet of Things (IoT), have spurned a dedicated research venture in the field of mental health. Recognizing that mental health issues are on an alarming rise, affecting the individual and the society in a progressively multi-faceted nature, and that existing human resources are not sufficient to tackle the crisis, decision-makers have turned to technology to see what opportunities it may offer. More than ever, this endeavor has gained importance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whose consequences not only severed the already fickle live human contact between the professionals and their patients but also onset a broad mental health crisis stemming from the virus’ impact on health and the implemented measures to control it. The role that IoT-enabled technology plays in this new landscape of digital mental health can be roughly divided into two complementary processes: assessment and intervention. Assessment concerns monitoring, learning about, and recognizing a person’s mental health issues through their physiology, behavior, thinking, emotional and cognitive states, and the context they live in. Intervention follows, and it conforms to the specifics of an assessment, attempting to effect attitude and behavior change in a person. Technology, especially artificial intelligence, enables assessment and intervention to be tailored very specifically to the individual. Omnipresent devices—e.g., smart bracelets—allow increasingly more accurate assessments, which allow not only better interventions but also interventions that can be delivered momentarily—e.g., with an intelligent cognitive assistant on a smartphone—with the continuous interchange of both as the biggest leap forward. Due to the research field still being young and thus not systematized into a coherent framework, even lacking an overview of methods, trends, and directions, this book chapter serves as an early attempt to codify this highly interdisciplinary relationship between technology and mental health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Internet of Things,,,105-128,,10.1007/978-3-030-91181-2_7,,#5626,Kolenik 2022,,,0
Social Media and Political Communication,"Lipschultz, J.H.","This book offers a wide-scale, interdisciplinary analysis and guide to social media and political communication, examining the political use of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. From disinformation to artificial intelligence, Jeremy Lipschultz explores how social media tools are being deployed by “good” and “bad” political actors. The use of “fake news” or disinformation is clearly contextualized for readers within a wider understanding of the historic uses of propaganda, persuasion and political advertising. Lipschultz also examines how social media is used by activists and social movements to increase civic engagement and amplify social issues. The book surveys traditional media communication theories and methods, exploring newsgatekeeping, propaganda, persuasion and personal influence, and diffusion of new technologies and ideas, teaching vital critical thinking methods for consuming, engaging with, and understanding political social media content from a media literacy perspective. It also includes social network analyses which offer visual representations of social media crowds that influence social movements and political change. Essential reading for students of Media and Cultural Studies, Communication, Journalism, Political Science, and Information Technology, as well as anyone wishing to understand the current intersection of social media and politics. © 2023 Jeremy Harris Lipschultz.",2022,,Social Media and Political Communication,,,1-210,,10.4324/9781003170471,,#5627,Lipschultz 2022,,,0
How intelligent neurotechnology can be epistemically unjust. An exploration into the ethics of algorithms,"Schleidgen, S.; Friedrich, O.; Wolkenstein, A.","Recently, the epistemic quality of algorithms and its normative implications have come under scrutiny. While general questions of justice have been addressed in this context, specific issues of epistemic (in)justice have so far been neglected. We aim to fill this gap by analyzing some potential implications of behavioral intelligent neurotechnology (B-INT). We claim that B-INT exhibits a number of epistemic features implying the potential for certain epistemic problems, which, in turn, are likely to result in instances of epistemic injustice. To support this claim, we will first introduce and specify the terminology and technology behind B-INT. Second, we will present four fictitious scenarios of using B-INT and highlight a number of epistemic issues that might arise. Third, we will discuss their relation to the concept of epistemic justice, as well as potential instances thereof. Thus, we will show some important and morally relevant implications of the epistemic properties of INT. © 2021 The Association for Social Economics.",2022,,Review of Social Economy,80,1,106-126,,10.1080/00346764.2021.1979241,,#5628,Schleidgen 2022,,,0
Argumentative Text Generation in Economic Domain,"Fishcheva, I.N.; Osadchiy, D.; Bochenina, K.O.; Kotelnikov, E.V.","The development of large and super-large language models, such as GPT-3, T5, Switch Transformer, ERNIE, etc., has significantly improved the performance of text generation. One of the important research directions in this area is the generation of texts with arguments. The solution of this problem can be used in business meetings, political debates, dialogue systems, for preparation of student essays. One of the main domains for these applications is the economic sphere. The key problem of the argument text generation for the Russian language is the lack of annotated argumentation corpora. In this paper, we use translated versions of the Argumentative Microtext, Persuasive Essays and UKP Sentential corpora to fine-tune RuBERT model. Further, this model is used to annotate the corpus of economic news by argumentation. Then the annotated corpus is employed to fine-tune the ruGPT-3 model, which generates argument texts. The results show that this approach improves the accuracy of the argument generation by more than 20 percentage points (63.2% vs. 42.5%) compared to the original ruGPT-3 model. © 2022 ABBYY PRODUCTION LLC.

KinVoices: Using Voices of Friends and Family in Voice Interfaces,"Chan, S.W.T.; Gunasekaran, T.S.; Pai, Y.S.; Zhang, H.; Nanayakkara, S.","With voice user interfaces (VUIs) becoming ubiquitous and speech synthesis technology maturing, it is possible to synthesise voices to resemble our friends and relatives (which we will collectively call 'kin') and use them on VUIs. However, designing such interfaces and investigating how the familiarity of kin voices affect user perceptions remain under-explored. Our surveys and interviews with 25 users revealed that VUIs using kin voices were perceived as more engaging, persuasive and safer yet eerier than VUIs using common virtual assistant voices. We then developed a technology probe, KinVoice, an Alexa-based VUI that was deployed in three households over two weeks. Users set reminders using KinVoice, which in turn, gave the reminders in synthesised kin voices. This was to explore users' needs, uncover challenges involved and inspire new applications. We discuss design guidelines for integrating familiar kin voices into VUIs, applications that benefit from its usage, and implications for balancing voice realism and usability with security and diversification.  © 2021 ACM.",2021,,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,5,CSCW2,,,10.1145/3479590,,#5634,Chan 2021,,,0
Swimming direction of the glass catfish is responsive to magnetic stimulation,"Hunt, R.D.; Ashbaugh, R.C.; Reimers, M.; Udpa, L.; de Jimenez, G.S.; Moore, M.; Gilad, A.A.; Pelled, G.","Several marine species have developed a magnetic perception that is essential for navigation and detection of prey and predators. One of these species is the transparent glass catfish that contains an ampullary organ dedicated to sense magnetic fields. Here we examine the behavior of the glass catfish in response to static magnetic fields which will provide valuable insight on function of this magnetic response. By utilizing state of the art animal tracking software and artificial intelligence approaches, we quantified the effects of magnetic fields on the swimming direction of glass catfish. The results demonstrate that glass catfish placed in a radial arm maze, consistently swim away from magnetic fields over 20 μT and show adaptability to changing magnetic field direction and location.

Study protocol for a randomised controlled trial of a web-based behavioural lifestyle programme for emPOWERment in early Multiple Sclerosis (POWER@MS1),"Krause, N.; Riemann-Lorenz, K.; Steffen, T.; Rahn, A.C.; Pöttgen, J.; Stellmann, J.-P.; Köpke, S.; Friede, T.; Icks, A.; Vomhof, M.; Temmes, H.; Van De Loo, M.; Gold, S.M.; Heesen, C.","Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects young adults. Uncertainty is a major psychological burden of the disease from diagnosis to prognosis, enhanced by the pressure to make early decisions on a diverse set of immunotherapies. Watchful waiting for 1-2 years while adapting goals and lifestyle habits to life with a chronic disease represents another reasonable option for persons with MS (PwMS). A behaviour change programme based on evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is not available in standard care. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an embedded process evaluation investigates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based behavioural lifestyle programme to change lifestyle behaviour and reduce inflammatory disease activity in PwMS. Methods and analysis A web-based behavioural intervention will be evaluated in an RCT aiming to recruit 328 persons with clinically isolated syndrome, suspected MS or confirmed MS for less than 1 year, who have not yet started immunotherapy. Moreover, a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation will be carried out. Participants will be recruited in at least 16 MS centres across Germany and randomised to an intervention group with 12 months of access to EBPI about lifestyle factors in MS, combined with a complex behaviour change programme or to a control group (optimised standard care). The combined primary endpoint is the incidence of new T2 lesions on MRI or confirmed relapses. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians (PV6015).

Advancing sustainable development goals through immunization: a literature review,"Decouttere, C.; De Boeck, K.; Vandaele, N.","Background: Immunization directly impacts health (SDG3) and brings a contribution to 14 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as ending poverty, reducing hunger, and reducing inequalities. Therefore, immunization is recognized to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this. Methods: We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges. Results: We reveal the leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis-à-vis the SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines, local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030. Conclusions: In general terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi) model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge, generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and Middle-Income Countries’ health authorities and communities to leverage immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in 2030. © 2021, The Author(s).",2021,,Globalization and Health,17,1,,,10.1186/s12992-021-00745-w,,#5637,Decouttere 2021,,,0
Wearable and Mobile Sensors for Personalized Nutrition,"Sempionatto, J.R.; Montiel, V.R.-V.; Vargas, E.; Teymourian, H.; Wang, J.","While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently, guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals' responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including calories-counting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly emerging wearable chemical sensing devices - generating enormous dynamic analytical data - with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.",2021,,ACS Sensors,6,5,1745-1760,,10.1021/acssensors.1c00553,,#5638,Sempionatto 2021,,,0

Telehealth behavioral intervention for diabetes management in adults with physical disabilities: Intervention fidelity protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Zengul, A.; Evans, E.; Hall, A.; Qu, H.; Willig, A.; Cherrington, A.; Thirumalai, M.","Background: Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem among people with physical disabilities. Health coaching has been proven to be an effective approach in terms of behavioral changes, patient self-efficacy, adherence to treatment, health service use, and health outcomes. Telehealth systems combined with health coaching have the potential to improve the quality of health care by increasing access to services. Treatment fidelity is particularly important for behavior change studies; however, fidelity protocols are inadequately administered and reported in the literature. Objective: The aim of this study is to outline all the intervention fidelity strategies and procedures of a telecoaching intervention-artificial intelligence for diabetes management (AI4DM)-which is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a telehealth platform in adults with type 2 diabetes and permanent impaired mobility. AI4DM aims to create a web-based disability-inclusive diabetes self-management program. We selected the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) fidelity framework to describe strategies to ensure intervention fidelity in our research. Methods: We have developed fidelity strategies based on the five fidelity domains outlined by the NIH BCC-focusing on study design, provider training, treatment delivery, treatment receipt, and enactment of treatment skills. The design of the study is grounded in the social cognitive theory and is intended to ensure that both arms would receive the same amount of attention from the intervention. All providers will receive standardized training to deliver consistent health coaching to the participants. The intervention will be delivered through various controlling and monitoring strategies to reduce differences within and between treatment groups. The content and structure of the study are delivered to ensure comprehension and participation among individuals with low health literacy. By constantly reviewing and monitoring participant progress and protocol adherence, we intend to ensure that participants use cognitive and behavioral skills in real-world settings to engage in health behavior. Results: Enrollment for AI4DM will begin in October 2021 and end in October 2022. The results of this study will be reported in late 2022. Conclusions: Developing and using fidelity protocols in behavior change studies is essential to ensure the internal and external validity of interventions. This study incorporates NIH BCC recommendations into an artificial intelligence embedded telecoaching platform for diabetes management designed for people with physical disabilities. The developed fidelity protocol can provide guidance for other researchers conducting telehealth interventions within behavioral health settings to present more consistent and reproducible research. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

Worker perspectives on incorporating artificial intelligence into office workspaces: Implications for the future of office work,"Fukumura, Y.E.; Gray, J.M.; Lucas, G.M.; Becerik-Gerber, B.; Roll, S.C.","Workplace environments have a significant impact on worker performance, health, and well-being. With machine learning capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed to automate individualized adjustments to work environments (e.g., lighting, temperature) and to facilitate healthier worker behaviors (e.g., posture). Worker perspectives on incorporating AI into office workspaces are largely unexplored. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore office workers’ views on including AI in their office workspace. Six focus group interviews with a total of 45 participants were conducted. Interview questions were designed to generate discussion on benefits, challenges, and pragmatic considerations for incorporating AI into office settings. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an iterative approach. Two primary constructs emerged. First, participants shared perspectives related to preferences and concerns regarding communication and interactions with the technology. Second, numerous conversations highlighted the dualistic nature of a system that collects large amounts of data; that is, the potential benefits for behavior change to improve health and the pitfalls of trust and privacy. Across both constructs, there was an overarching discussion related to the intersections of AI with the complexity of work performance. Numerous thoughts were shared relative to future AI solutions that could enhance the office workplace. This study’s findings indicate that the acceptability of AI in the workplace is complex and dependent upon the benefits outweighing the potential detriments. Office worker needs are complex and diverse, and AI systems should aim to accommodate individual needs. © 2021 by the authors.

Emotional persuasion decision model based on Agent's trust,"Wu, J.; Wang, J.; Zhang, F.; Han, J.; Ye, H.","Emotional persuasion based on an Agent's trust can better utilize a variety of artificial intelligence advantages of an Agent. Aiming at the currently insufficient research on decision models, based on an Agent's own character, emotion decay and external stimulation, the algorithm of emotional intensity was constructed by using the big five characters, the OCC(Ortony, Clore, Collins) emotion model and the first law of emotional intensity. Considering the effects of transaction quality on trust, fuzzification and defuzzification were carried out on the transaction quality of an Agent by using the language evaluation method, the triangular fuzzy number and the Converting Fuzzy data into Crisp Scores Converting Fuzzy data into Crisp Scores(CFCS) algorithm, and then the algorithm of the transaction quality was correspondingly constructed. After the existing updating factor of trust is improved, the updating algorithm of an Agent's trust was developed. On the basis of the aforementioned algorithms, the emotional persuasion decision model based on an Agent's trust was established with TOmada de Decisao Interativa e Multicritévio(TODIM) method, and the attribute weights in the model were determined by the entropy weight method. To show the appropriateness and validity of the proposed model, a numerical example was designed for illustration, and the decision results obtained from different combinations of parameter values were analyzed and compared with those of the related research.

Survey on Detection and Prevention of Phishing Websites using Machine Learning,"Rastogi, M.; Chhetri, A.; Singh, D.K.; Rajan V, G.","This research paper discusses on the phishing websites Prevention and Detection. A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. Phishing is the most commonly used social engineering and cyber-attack. Through such attacks, the phisher targets naïve online users by tricking them into revealing confidential information, with the purpose of using it fraudulently. In our paper we will be discussing and listing a few of the artificial intelligence models, that will help us to detect these phishing websites so that in the future these data and techniques can be used in machine learning to make our system better and efficient. The problem of phishing is widespread and there is no particular single solution available to effectively reduce all vulnerabilities, so many techniques are often used to reduce certain attacks. Machine learning is a useful tool used to reduce phishing attacks.As innovation keeps on developing, phishing strategies began to advance quickly several anti-phishing tools are available and have their own disadvantages. The paper concentrates on basic Machine learning supervised classification techniques to seek out an answer to phishing attacks. The Basic principle of this paper is to execute the frameworks with good efficiency, exactness, and cost-effectively. The task is attained by using 4 ML managed classification models. The four classification models are KNN, Kernel-SVM, Rando Forest Classifier and Decision tree. The supervised classification contains a labeled dataset that is used to train the models. All the four algorithms used: KNN, Kernel-SVM, Rando Forest Classifier and Decision tree are classification models. With machine learning, cybersecurity systems can analyze patterns and learn from them to assist prevent similar attacks and answer changing behavior. It can help users to be more active in preventing threats and respond to active attacks in real-time.

Defining Features of Behavior Design: Considering Context,"Gram-Hansen, S.B.","Since the early recognition of Persuasive Technologies, the notion of digital design with the intent to influence and change attitudes and behaviors has evolved tremendously. Digital influence and behavior design is now recognize in a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches, and behavior design is continuously influencing more complex application domains. With the development of the field emerges a need for clearer understanding of these different design approaches, their possibilities and limitations, in order for designers to identify and apply the best approach depending on the intent and context. In this paper, we discuss some of the primary overlaps between Nudging and Persuasive Design. Moreover, we point towards research in neuroscience in order to highlight a potential need to reconsider central elements of persuasive design, such as efficient praise and rewards.

"The Design and Development of a Personalized Leisure Time Physical Activity Application Based on Behavior Change Theories, End-User Perceptions, and Principles From Empirical Data Mining","Sporrel, K.; De Boer, R.D.D.; Wang, S.; Nibbeling, N.; Simons, M.; Deutekom, M.; Ettema, D.; Castro, P.C.; Dourado, V.Z.; Kröse, B.","Introduction: Many adults do not reach the recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines, which can lead to serious health problems. A promising method to increase PA is the use of smartphone PA applications. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple PA apps, it remains unclear how to develop and design engaging and effective PA apps. Furthermore, little is known on ways to harness the potential of artificial intelligence for developing personalized apps. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the Playful data-driven Active Urban Living (PAUL): a personalized PA application. Methods: The two-phased development process of the PAUL apps rests on principles from the behavior change model; the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework; and the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model. During the first phase, we explored whether location-specific information on performing PA in the built environment is an enhancement to a PA app. During the second phase, the other modules of the app were developed. To this end, we first build the theoretical foundation for the PAUL intervention by performing a literature study. Next, a focus group study was performed to translate the theoretical foundations and the needs and wishes in a set of user requirements. Since the participants indicated the need for reminders at a for-them-relevant moment, we developed a self-learning module for the timing of the reminders. To initialize this module, a data-mining study was performed with historical running data to determine good situations for running. Results: The results of these studies informed the design of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) application for running, walking, and performing strength exercises. The app is implemented as a set of modules based on the persuasive strategies “monitoring of behavior,” “feedback,” “goal setting,” “reminders,” “rewards,” and “providing instruction.” An architecture was set up consisting of a smartphone app for the user, a back-end server for storage and adaptivity, and a research portal to provide access to the research team. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary research encompassing psychology, human movement sciences, computer science, and artificial intelligence has led to a theoretically and empirically driven leisure time PA application. In the current phase, the feasibility of the PAUL app is being assessed. © Copyright © 2021 Sporrel, De Boer, Wang, Nibbeling, Simons, Deutekom, Ettema, Castro, Dourado and Kröse.",2021,,Frontiers in Public Health,8,,,,10.3389/fpubh.2020.528472,,#5649,Sporrel 2021,,,0

We included experimental studies that incorporated EMIs based on EMAs delivered through smartphone apps to promote health behaviors in any health domain. Studies were independently screened. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. We performed a narrative synthesis of intervention effects, user perspectives and engagement, and intervention design and characteristics. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included studies. Results: We included 19 papers describing 17 unique studies and comprising 652 participants. Most studies were quasi-experimental (13/17, 76%), had small sample sizes, and great heterogeneity in intervention designs and measurements. EMIs were most popular in the mental health domain (8/17, 47%), followed by substance abuse (3/17, 18%), diet, weight loss, physical activity (4/17, 24%), and smoking (2/17, 12%). Of the 17 studies, the 4 (24%) included randomized controlled trials reported nonstatistically significant effects on health behaviors, and 4 (24%) quasi-experimental studies reported statistically significant pre-post improvements in self-reported primary outcomes, namely depressive (P<.001) and psychotic symptoms (P=.03), drinking frequency (P<.001), and eating patterns (P=.01). EMA was commonly used to capture subjective experiences as well as behaviors, whereas sensors were rarely used. Generally, users perceived EMIs to be helpful. Common suggestions for improvement included enhancing personalization, multimedia and interactive capabilities (eg, voice recording), and lowering the EMA reporting burden. EMI and EMA components were rarely reported and were not described in a standardized manner across studies, hampering progress in this field. A reporting checklist was developed to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of findings and enhance the transparency and replicability of future studies using EMAs and EMIs. Conclusions: The use of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs to promote behavior change is an emerging area of research, with few studies evaluating efficacy. Such interventions could present an opportunity to enhance health but need further assessment in larger participant cohorts and well-designed evaluations following reporting checklists. Future research should explore combining self-reported EMAs of subjective experiences with objective data passively collected via sensors to promote personalization while minimizing user burden, as well as explore different EMA data collection methods (eg, chatbots). © Kim Phuong Dao, Katrien De Cocker, Huong Ly Tong, A Baki Kocaballi, Clara Chow, Liliana Laranjo.",2021,,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,9,11,,,10.2196/22890,,#5651,Dao 2021,,,0
Interpreting the Rhetoric of Visual Advertisements,"Ye, K.; Nazari, N.H.; Hahn, J.; Hussain, Z.; Zhang, M.; Kovashka, A.","Visual media have important persuasive power, but prior computer vision approaches have predominantly ignored the persuasive aspects of images. In this work, we propose a suite of data and techniques that enable progress on understanding the messages that visual advertisements convey. We make available a dataset of 64,832 image ads and 3,477 video ads, annotated with ten types of information: the topic and sentiment of the ad; whether it is funny, exciting, or effective; what action it prompts the viewer to do, and what arguments it provides for why this action should be taken; symbolic associations that the ad relies on; the metaphorical object transformations on which especially creative ads rely; and the climax in video ads. We develop methods that use multimodal cues, i.e., both visuals and slogans, for both the image and video domains. Our methods rely on finding poignant content spatially and temporally. We also examine the creative story construction in ads: for videos, we learn to predict when the climax occurs (if any), and how effective the story is; for images, we analyze how object transformations in ads metaphorically depict product properties. © 1979-2012 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence,43,4,1308-1323,,10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2947440,,#5652,Ye 2021,,,0
Understanding the effect of anthropomorphic design: Towards more persuasive conversational agents,"Cui, T.; Peng, X.; Wang, X.","Within the emerging context of using interactive conversational agents (CAs) to persuade and activate individuals' behavior changes, it is important to understand how to design CAs to engage in effective communication and generate positive social response. Drawing upon the social response theory and elaboration likelihood model for persuasion literature, we investigate the interaction effects of anthropomorphic CA design and issue involvement of recipients on the perceived persuasion as well as behavioral intention. We suggest that for individuals of low issue involvement, CAs with visual social cues are more effective, while CAs with verbal social cues are more effective in persuading high issues involved individuals of the recommended behavior. We will evaluate the persuasive and human-like CA design by conducting a 3x2 experiment. We believe that this study will significantly contribute to the theoretical landscape of anthropomorphic design and human-AI interaction, and provide important practical contributions for CA designers. © ICIS 2020.

More like a person than reading text in a machine': Characterizing User Choice of Embodied Agents vs. ConventionalGUIs on Smartphones,"Olafsson, S.; Parmar, D.; Kimani, E.; O'Leary, T.K.; Bickmore, T.","Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) provide an interface modality on smartphones that may be particularly effective for tasks with significant social, affective, reflective, and narrative aspects, such as health education and behavior change counseling. However, the conversational medium is significantly slower than conventional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for brief, time-sensitive tasks. We conducted a randomized experiment to determine user preferences in performing two kinds of health-related tasks - one affective and narrative in nature and one transactional - and gave participants a choice of a conventional GUI or a functionally equivalent ECA on a smartphone to complete the task. We found significant main effects of task type and user preference on user choice of modality, with participants choosing the conventional GUI more often for transactional and time-sensitive tasks. © 2021 ACM.",2021,,Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings,,,,,10.1145/3411763.3451664,,#5654,Olafsson 2021,,,0
The burden of persuasion in structured argumentation,"Calegari, R.; Riveret, R.; Sartor, G.","In this paper we provide an account of the burden of persuasion in the context of structured argumentation. A formal model for the burden of persuasion is defined, discussed, and used to capture the role of the burden of persuasion in adjudicating conflicts between conflicting arguments and in determining the dialectical status of arguments. We consider how our model can also capture adversarial burdens of proof, namely, those cases in which failure to establish an argument for a proposition burdened with persuasion entails establishing the complementary proposition.  © 2021 ACM.",2021,,"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ICAIL 2021",,,180-184,,10.1145/3462757.3466078,,#5655,Calegari 2021,,,0
Personalization Paradox in Behavior Change Apps: Lessons from a Social Comparison-Based Personalized App for Physical Activity,"Zhu, J.; Dallal, D.H.; Gray, R.C.; Villareale, J.; Ontañón, S.; Forman, E.M.; Arigo, D.","Social comparison-based features are widely used in social computing apps. However, most existing apps are not grounded in social comparison theories and do not consider individual differences in social comparison preferences and reactions. This paper is among the first to automatically personalize social comparison targets. In the context of an m-health app for physical activity, we use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of multi-armed bandits. Results from our user study (n=53) indicate that there is some evidence that motivation can be increased using the AI-based personalization of social comparison. The detected effects achieved small-to-moderate effect sizes, illustrating the real-world implications of the intervention for enhancing motivation and physical activity. In addition to design implications for social comparison features in social apps, this paper identified the personalization paradox, the conflict between user modeling and adaptation, as a key design challenge of personalized applications for behavior change. Additionally, we propose research directions to mitigate this Personalization Paradox.  © 2021 ACM.",2021,,Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction,5,CSCW1,,,10.1145/3449190,,#5656,Zhu 2021,,,0
Cognitive Living Spaces by Using IoT Devices and Ambient Biosensor Technologies,"Herwig, Z.; Paletta, L.; Aldrian, J.; Unterberger, R.","In the near future, our deeply connected and fully digitized physical facilities require cognitive processes that are embodied in a regular sensing of living environments. Pervasive sensor networks will enable the development of more efficient technologies that will integrate Artificial Intelligence based services better into psychosocial and human ecological contexts. These innovative mixed and integrated biophysical and digital living spaces enable to use them more efficiently, conveniently, and, furthermore, to interpret these new intelligent environments in a completely different way. Based on the growing insight into relations between human beings and their surroundings, residents get an overview of their building ecosphere. They obtain the potential to develop strategies in context with intelligent buildings that are enabled to assist in changing behaviors in everyday life. We study human factors, in particular, the potential of change in human behavior in such fully integrated services, strongly related to our living and work place in the case of home office. After using these sentient cognitive environments, we explore novel ways of interacting with living and work spaces by offering opportunities to give intelligent environments a virtual voice and representation via the digital data space. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people should pay more attention to their immediate living and working environment: it becomes more important to monitor the quality of the air to breathe, surroundings are made visible to get to know them better, cope better, enjoy them, etc. The presented work provides in this context quantitative data from novel low-cost biosensors, such as for measuring carbon dioxide concentration distribution, highlighting the presence and attention of residents and their change in behavior within a sample living space, and also provides conclusions towards novel research pathways for integrating cognitive processes into a network of IoT devices and ambient biosensor technologies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Networks and Systems,259,,403-410,,10.1007/978-3-030-80285-1_47,,#5659,Herwig 2021,,,0

The emergence of explainability of intelligent systems: Delivering explainable and personalized recommendations for energy efficiency,"Sardianos, C.; Varlamis, I.; Chronis, C.; Dimitrakopoulos, G.; Alsalemi, A.; Himeur, Y.; Bensaali, F.; Amira, A.","The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning and deep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in several ways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for a deeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The concept of explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal system mechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems that support human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. In this study, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energy efficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasive recommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. The persuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) or on a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason for recommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using a Telegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data and human feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19% on the recommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasive facts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems, demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energy saving behavior. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",2021,,International Journal of Intelligent Systems,36,2,656-680,,10.1002/int.22314,,#5662,Sardianos 2021,,,0
"A systematic review of artificial intelligence chatbots for promoting physical activity, healthy diet, and weight loss","Oh, Y.J.; Zhang, J.; Fang, M.-L.; Fukuoka, Y.","Background: This systematic review aimed to evaluate AI chatbot characteristics, functions, and core conversational capacities and investigate whether AI chatbot interventions were effective in changing physical activity, healthy eating, weight management behaviors, and other related health outcomes. Methods: In collaboration with a medical librarian, six electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and IEEE) were searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. The National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used to assess risk of bias in individual studies. We applied the AI Chatbot Behavior Change Model to characterize components of chatbot interventions, including chatbot characteristics, persuasive and relational capacity, and evaluation of outcomes. Results: The database search retrieved 1692 citations, and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 4 were randomized controlled trials and 5 were quasi-experimental studies. Five out of the seven studies suggest chatbot interventions are promising strategies in increasing physical activity. In contrast, the number of studies focusing on changing diet and weight status was limited. Outcome assessments, however, were reported inconsistently across the studies. Eighty-nine and thirty-three percent of the studies specified a name and gender (i.e., woman) of the chatbot, respectively. Over half (56%) of the studies used a constrained chatbot (i.e., rule-based), while the remaining studies used unconstrained chatbots that resemble human-to-human communication. Conclusion: Chatbots may improve physical activity, but we were not able to make definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of chatbot interventions on physical activity, diet, and weight management/loss. Application of AI chatbots is an emerging field of research in lifestyle modification programs and is expected to grow exponentially. Thus, standardization of designing and reporting chatbot interventions is warranted in the near future.

Tailoring coaching strategies to users’ motivation in a multi-agent health coaching application,"Beinema, T.; op den Akker, H.; van Velsen, L.; Hermens, H.","Embodied conversational agents are often included in health behaviour change applications as intelligent virtual coaches. A major challenge in their development is tailoring coaching dialogues to user profiles. Agents should collect information about the user and consequently adapt the strategy that guides their interactions. Previous research discovered relations between users’ motivation profiles and potential effective coaching strategies. In the current paper, we describe an experiment with multiple agents that tests if users with certain motivation profiles prefer certain (tailored) strategies. Participants were classified into four motivation groups (Intrinsic Motivation, External Regulation, Dual Motivation, A-motivation), following their responses to a questionnaire on motivation towards healthy living. Then, two coaches suggested a positively and a negatively tailored strategy. Participants rated these and chose their favourite. Results (N = 108) show that the Dual Motivation group appreciated their positively tailored strategy more than their negatively tailored strategy, while intrinsically motivated participants appreciated both strategies. Furthermore, agents' likeability does not seem to influence strategy appreciation, while there was an effect of participant's age and gender. We conclude that coaching strategies for dialogues with agents can be tailored to personal motivation to live healthy. Future research should focus on performing a long-term study in a real-life setting. © 2021 The Author(s)",2021,,Computers in Human Behavior,121,,,,10.1016/j.chb.2021.106787,,#5666,Beinema 2021,,,0
"SecuBot, a teacher in appearance: How social chatbots can influence people","Saleilles, J.; Aïmeur, E.","Users nowadays seem to be more aware of the dangers of giving their data to other entities. However, people are easily influenced and can still provide personal data, leading to fraud, data theft, or worse. Extending social chatbots to influence people can prove efficient as they can act as malicious friends. These conversational agents can be used in various domains such as news, e-commerce, or therapy. They can come with multiple personalities to accomplish different purposes. However, using phrases that may be offensive or present an excessive amount of anthropomorphic traits can, in some cases, cause harm to the user.

“See the Image in Different Contexts”: Using Reverse Image Search to Support the Identification of Fake News in Instagram-Like Social Media,"Aprin, F.; Chounta, I.-A.; Hoppe, H.U.","Social media are an integral part of the daily lives of today’s young generation. In addition to the positive impact on learning through these channels, there are also risks related to toxic content like “fake news” on various social media. Fake news aims to change opinions based on disinformation or misinformation supporting conspiracy theories, e.g., related to the pandemic. Fake news creators use various multimedia artifacts, including images taken from serious and valid news sources, to attract the audience’s attention. Tracking images in different contexts can give social media users important clues to distinguish fake news from credible information. We report on the development of a web-based learning environment that includes a “virtual learning companion” to help learners improve their understanding, awareness, and critical thinking concerning such social media threats. The learning environment mimics Instagram and includes toxic and non-toxic content in a controlled way. The companion is implemented as a browser plugin that communicates with students via chat. The companion poses knowledge activation questions and answers according to an underlying script. The companion offers other sources with the same image identified through Reverse Image Search (RIS). The goal is to help learners find the same image in different contexts with different textual descriptions and keywords. For this purpose, we added basic NLP mechanisms to extract keywords from these contexts, including keywords that signal persuasiveness. Currently, we evaluate the impact of this tool and the provided support in distinguishing fake or credible news. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13284 LNCS,,264-275,,10.1007/978-3-031-09680-8_25,,#5669,Aprin 2022,,,0
Promoting physical activity through conversational agents: Mixed methods systematic review,"Luo, T.C.; Aguilera, A.; Lyles, C.R.; Figueroa, C.A.","Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is crucial for well-being; however, healthy habits are difficult to create and maintain. Interventions delivered via conversational agents (eg, chatbots or virtual agents) are a novel and potentially accessible way to promote PA. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of research that uses conversational agents. Objective: This mixed methods systematic review aims to summarize the usability and effectiveness of conversational agents in promoting PA, describe common theories and intervention components used, and identify areas for further development. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review. We searched seven electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies that conveyed primary research on automated conversational agents designed to increase PA. The studies were independently screened, and their methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool by 2 reviewers. Data on intervention impact and effectiveness, treatment characteristics, and challenges were extracted and analyzed using parallel-results convergent synthesis and narrative summary. Results: In total, 255 studies were identified, 7.8% (20) of which met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was varied. Overall, conversational agents had moderate usability and feasibility. Those that were evaluated through randomized controlled trials were found to be effective in promoting PA. Common challenges facing interventions were repetitive program content, high attrition, technical issues, and safety and privacy concerns. Conclusions: Conversational agents hold promise for PA interventions. However, there is a lack of rigorous research on long-term intervention effectiveness and patient safety. Future interventions should be based on evidence-informed theories and treatment approaches and should address users' desires for program variety, natural language processing, delivery via mobile devices, and safety and privacy concerns. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping review informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines to identify current knowledge and gaps in this domain. Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria for full text review. The following topics were represented in the studies, some of which involved more than 1 topic: disease prevention (N = 5/10, 50%), treatment decisions (N = 5/10, 50%), medication harms reduction (N = 1/10, 10%), and presentation of cardiovascular risk information (N = 5/10, 50%).

Use and effect of web-based embodied conversational agents for improving eating behavior and decreasing loneliness among community-dwelling older adults: Protocol for a randomized controlled trial,"Kramer, L.L.; Mulder, B.C.; van Velsen, L.; de Vet, E.","Background: An unhealthy eating pattern and loneliness negatively influence quality of life in older age. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are a promising way to address these health behaviors in an engaging manner. Objective: We aim to (1) identify whether ECAs can persuade community-dwelling older adults to change their dietary behavior and whether ECA use can decrease loneliness, (2) test these pathways to effects, and (3) understand the use of an ECA. Methods: The web-based eHealth app PACO is a fully automated 8-week intervention in which 2 ECAs engage older adults in dialogue to motivate them to change their dietary behavior and decrease their loneliness. PACO was developed via a human-centered and stakeholder-inclusive design approach and incorporates Self-determination Theory and various behavior change techniques. For this study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial will be performed. There will be 2 cohorts, with 30 participants per cohort. Participants in the first cohort will immediately receive the PACO app for 8 weeks, while participants in the second cohort receive the PACO app after a waiting-list condition of 4 weeks. Participants will be recruited via social media, an online panel, flyers, and advertorials. To be eligible, participants must be at least 65 years of age, must not be in paid employment, and must live alone independently at home. Primary outcomes will be self-assessed via online questionnaires at intake, control, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks, and will include eating behavior and loneliness. In addition, the primary outcome-use-will be measured via data logs. Secondary outcomes will be measured at the same junctures, via either validated, self-assessed, online questionnaires or an optional interview. Results: As of July 2020, we have begun recruiting participants. Conclusions: By unraveling the mechanisms behind the use of a web-based intervention with ECAs, we hope to gain a fine-grained understanding of both the effectiveness and the use of ECAs in the health context.

Activity theory differentiates between sense-making and stimuli-oriented types of motives that have a strong influence on our daily behavior. Two main challenges are explored in this paper: 1) the personalisation of graphical user interfaces to mediate representations of motivation-based activities to support behaviour change processes; and 2) the proactiveness of such visual representations.As methods, we use activity theory as a framework for defining the motivations' dynamics, and formal argumentation theory as the underlying mechanism for interactive reasoning and decision-making in the process of generating the user interface.Our contributions are two-folded: 1) a dynamic graphical user interface where the background responds to behaviors linked to sense-making motives, and the foreground to stimuli motivation; and 2) a non-monotonic reasoning mechanism endowing the user interface with proactiveness (not only react to the user interactions but trigger and direct attention to potential conflicts), and a motive-based behavior conflict resolution process. Future work includes user studies to explore how triggering of focus may create increased awareness in an individual of conflicting motives in daily activities and how this may support changes of unhealthy habits.  © 2021 IEEE.",2021,,"33rd Workshop of the Swedish Artificial Intelligence Society, SAIS 2021",,,,,10.1109/SAIS53221.2021.9484008,,#5678,Guerrero 2021,,,0
Humane visual AI: Telling the stories behind a medical condition,"So, W.; Bogucka, E.P.; Scepanovic, S.; Joglekar, S.; Zhou, K.; Quercia, D.","A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around half a million Reddit posts in the sub-communities specialised in 14 medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep-learning framework. In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations. © 1995-2012 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics,27,2,678-688,,10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030391,,#5680,So 2021,,,0
Imitation of Real Lane-Change Decisions Using Reinforcement Learning,"Zhao, L.; Farhi, N.; Christoforou, Z.; Haddadou, N.","Microscopic modeling of human driving consists generally in combining both car-following and lane-change models. While the human car-following process has been extensively developed and well modeled, the lane-change behavior is more complex to understand and still remains to be explored. Classical lane-change models are usually rule-based and handcrafted, that tend to exhibit limited performance. Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) ones, provide an alternative approach and have recently achieved high success in modeling difficult decision-making processes in many fields. We propose in this article a reinforcement learning based model for the human lane-change behavior, with an online calibration of real lane-change decisions, extracted from the NGSIM data-set. In addition, we use the traffic vehicular simulator SUMO (""Simulation of Urban Mobility"") to create a numerical simulation environment. The utilization of numerical traffic simulation allows us enriching the data-set, for training the agent to find an optimal policy for lane change. Thus, about 13% additional traffic situations, not present in the real data, are created by the traffic simulation environment. The trained agent is collision-free and human-like who is satisfactory to real data and also to the additional simulated data. Moreover, our RL model can perform up to 95.37% of the real decisions observed in the data-set. © 2021 The Authors.",2021,,IFAC-PapersOnLine,54,2,203-209,,10.1016/j.ifacol.2021.06.023,,#5682,Zhao 2021,,,0

Assessing procedural pain in infants: a feasibility study evaluating a point-of-care mobile solution based on automated facial analysis,"Hoti, K.; Chivers, P.T.; Hughes, J.D.","Background: The management of procedural pain in infants is suboptimal, in part, compounded by the scarcity of a simple, accurate, and reliable method of assessing such pain. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PainChek Infant, a point-of-care mobile application that uses automated facial evaluation and analysis in the assessment of procedural pain in infants. Methods: Video recordings of 40 infants were randomly chosen from a purposely assembled digital library of 410 children undergoing immunisation as part of their standard care in Prishtina, Kosovo, between April 4, 2017, and July 11, 2018. For each infant recording, four 10 s video segments were extracted, corresponding to baseline, vaccine preparation, during vaccination, and recovery. Four trained assessors did pain assessments on the video segments of 30 infants, using PainChek Infant standard, PainChek Infant adaptive, the Neonatal Facial Coding System-Revised (NFCS-R) single, the NFCS-R multiple, and the Observer administered Visual Analogue Scale (ObsVAS), on two separate occasions. PainChek Infant's performance was compared to NFCS-R and ObsVAS using correlation in changes in pain scores, intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency. Findings: 4303 pain assessments were completed in two separate testing sessions, on Aug 31, and Oct 19, 2020. The study involved videos of 40 infants aged 2·2–6·9 months (median age 3·4 months [IQR 2·3–4·5]). All pain assessment tools showed significant changes in the recorded pain scores across the four video segments (p≤0·0006). All tools were found to be responsive to procedure-induced pain, with the degree of change in pain scores not influenced by pre-vaccination pain levels. PainChek Infant pain scores showed good correlation with NFCS-R and ObsVAS scores (r=0·82–0·88; p<0·0001). PainChek Infant also showed good to excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC=0·81–0·97, p<0·001) and high levels of internal consistency (α=0·82–0·97). Interpretation: PainChek Infant's use of automated facial expression analysis could offer a valid and reliable means of assessing and monitoring procedural pain in infants. Its clinical utility in clinical practice requires further research. Funding: PainChek. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In search of embodied conversational and explainable agents for health behaviour change and adherence,"Abdulrahman, A.; Richards, D.","Conversational agents offer promise to provide an alternative to costly and scarce access to human health providers. Particularly in the context of adherence to treatment advice and health behavior change, they can provide an ongoing coaching role to motivate and keep the health consumer on track. Due to the recognized importance of face-to-face communication and establishment of a therapist-patient working alliance as the biggest single predictor of adherence, our review focuses on embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and their use in health and well-being interventions. The article also introduces ECAs who provide explanations of their recommendations, known as explainable agents (XAs), as a way to build trust and enhance the working alliance towards improved behavior change. Of particular promise, is work in which XAs are able to engage in conversation to learn about their user and personalize their recommendations based on their knowledge of the user and then tailor their explanations to the beliefs and goals of the user to increase relevancy and motivation and address possible barriers to increase intention to perform the healthy behavior. © 2021 by the authors.

Evolution and Outcomes of Premature Coronary Artery Disease,"Smith, C.L.; Seigerman, M.; Adusumalli, S.; Giri, J.; Fiorilli, P.N.; Kolansky, D.M.; Kobayashi, T.","Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to explore the evolution and outcomes of premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) while reviewing strategies for effective screening of those at high risk for developing this disease. Recent Findings: Premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) affects a population of patients not typically identified as high risk by current risk stratification guidelines or traditional risk calculation tools. Not only does PCAD represent a large proportion of overall cardiovascular disease, it also afflicts a population in which the rate of mortality from cardiovascular disease has plateaued despite an overall declining population-wide cardiovascular mortality rate. There is ample opportunity for behavioral change strategies, screening tools, adapted imaging modalities, and precision pharmacotherapies to be more precisely targeted toward those at highest risk for premature coronary artery disease. Summary: Premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) is pervasive and not frequently represented within contemporary risk calculation models. Providers should pursue proactive screening and aggressive risk factor modification and deploy appropriate preventative therapies in caring for younger populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",2021,,Current Cardiology Reports,23,4,,,10.1007/s11886-021-01457-8,,#5687,Smith 2021,,,0
Choice of behavioral change techniques in health care conversational agents: Protocol for a scoping review,"Martinengo, L.; Lo, N.Y.W.; Goh, W.I.W.T.; Car, L.T.","Background: Conversational agents or chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversations with users. Conversational agents are increasingly used for delivery of behavior change interventions in health care. Behavior change is complex and comprises the use of one or several components collectively known as behavioral change techniques (BCTs). Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to identify the BCTs that are used in behavior change-focused interventions delivered via conversational agents in health care. Methods: This scoping review will be performed in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and will be reported according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews guidelines. We will perform a comprehensive search of electronic databases and grey literature sources, and will check the reference lists of included studies for additional relevant studies. The screening and data extraction will be performed independently and in parallel by two review authors. Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or discussion with a third review author. We will use a data extraction form congruent with the key themes and aims of this scoping review. BCTs employed in the included studies will be coded in line with BCT Taxonomy v1. We will analyze the data qualitatively and present it in diagrammatic or tabular form, alongside a narrative summary. Results: To date, we have designed the search strategy and performed the search on April 26, 2021. The first round of screening of retrieved articles is planned to begin soon. Conclusions: Using appropriate BCTs in the design and delivery of health care interventions via conversational agents is essential to improve long-term outcomes. Our findings will serve to inform the development of future interventions in this area. © Laura Martinengo, Nicholas Y W Lo, Westin I W T Goh, Lorainne Tudor Car.

Short and long-term innovations on dietary behavior assessment and coaching: Present efforts and vision of the pride and prejudice consortium,"Lucassen, D.A.; Lasschuijt, M.P.; Camps, G.; Van Loo, E.J.; Fischer, A.R.H.; de Vries, R.A.J.; Haarman, J.A.M.; Simons, M.; de Vet, E.; Vos, M.B.; Pan, S.; Ren, X.; de Graaf, K.; Lu, Y.; Feskens, E.J.M.; Brouwer-Brolsma, E.M.","Overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors, including diet, have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However, as shown by numerous studies, and in clinical practice, it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of ‘one-size-fits-all’ nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation, the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life, nutrition, ICT, design, behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology. P&P focuses on the development and integration of innovative technological techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, conversational agents, behavior change theory and personalized coaching to improve current practices and establish lasting dietary behavior change. © 2021 by the authors.

"AI and business models: The good, the bad and the ugly","Sena, V.; Nocker, M.","Over the last five years, several scholars from a range of disciplines have started to analyse how Artificial Intelligence (AI) affects businesses outcomes. This research effort has produced many predictions on the expected impact of automation on labour demand and equilibrium employment. However, most of the expected results are dependent on how businesses change their behaviour due to adopting AI. We argue that, as AI diffuses across the economy, changing behaviour is a necessary outcome for incumbents: the argument is that the diffusion of AI across an industry generates the conditions for a process of value migration from incumbents to new entrants (Helper et al., 2018); in these cases, the only mechanism available to incumbents to offset the negative impact of the migration process is by changing the architecture of their business, i.e., the business model. However, companies can choose from several AI-driven business models; their preference for one model is driven by many industry-level factors such as technical standards, the structure of the technology industry and the presence of an ethical framework for the use of AI. This monologue summarises the existing literature on business model innovation and AI; it then analyses the industry-level factors that may shape the business-level preference for specific business models. Finally, the monologue offers some suggestions for future research in the area. © 2021 Now Publishers Inc.

Research on the Influence of Rumors on Consumers' Irrational Purchasing Behavior under Public Crisis in the Era of Big Data,"He, J.; Mou, Y.; Zhang, Z.","Based on COVID-19 and Persuasion Communication Theory, this study constructs a research model to analyze the influence of rumors on consumers' irrational purchasing behavior in the context of public crisis. Using an online questionnaire survey, the empirical results show that information quantity, content features, platform credibility, and source credibility all have a significant positive impact on rumor credibility; rumor credibility has a significant positive impact on negative emotion; Negative emotions have a significant positive impact on irrational purchasing behavior. The platform, source, quantity, and content features of rumors will affect people's trust in rumors. Rumors cause social panic and lead to a surge of negative emotion, making people lose rational judgment and make irrational purchasing behavior. These irrational behaviors are largely due to the panic about some rumors, the urgency, and suddenness of public crisis events, making people more willing to believe in the uncertain information and engage in some irrational consumption behaviors. ©Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2021,,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,1852,3,,,10.1088/1742-6596/1852/3/032057,,#5696,He 2021,,,0
Smart-object-based reasoning system for indoor acoustic profiling of elderly inhabitants,"Chin, J.; Tisan, A.; Callaghan, V.; Chik, D.","Many countries are facing significant challenges in relation to providing adequate care for their elderly citizens. The roots of these issues are manifold, but include changing demographics, changing behaviours, and a shortage of resources. As has been witnessed in the health sector and many others in society, technology has much to offer in terms of supporting people’s needs. This paper explores the potential for ambient intelligence to address this challenge by creating a system that is able to passively monitor the home environment, detecting abnormal situations which may indicate that the inhabitant needs help. There are many ways that this might be achieved, but in this paper, we will describe our investigation into an approach involving unobtrusively ’listening’ to sound patterns within the home, which classifies these as either normal daily activities, or abnormal situations. The experimental system we built was composed of an innovative combination of acoustic sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which we argue in the paper that it provides a cost-effective approach to alerting care providers when an elderly person in their charge needs help. The majority of the innovation in our work concerns the AI in which we employ Machine Learning to classify the sound profiles, analyse the data for abnormal events, and to make decisions for raising alerts with carers. A Neural Network classifier was used to train and identify the sound profiles associated with normal daily routines within a given person’s home, signalling departures from the daily routines that were then used as templates to measure deviations from normality, which were used to make weighted decisions regarding calling for assistance. A practical experimental system was then designed and deployed to evaluate the methods advocated by this research. The methodology involved gathering pre-design and post-design data from both a professionally run residential home and a domestic home. The pre-design data gathered the views on the system design from 11 members of the residential home, using survey questionnaires and focus groups. These data were used to inform the design of the experimental system, which was then deployed in a domestic home setting to gather post-design experimental data. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to detect 84% of abnormal events, and advocated several refinements which would improve the performance of the system. Thus, the research concludes that the system represents an important advancement to the state-of-the-art and, when taken together with the refinements, represents a line of research which has the potential to deliver significant improvements to care provision for the elderly. © 2021 by the authors.

The potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing adult weight loss: A scoping review,"Chew, H.S.J.; Ang, W.H.D.; Lau, Y.","Objective: To present an overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to regulate eating and dietary behaviours, exercise behaviours and weight loss. Design: A scoping review of global literature published from inception to 15 December 2020 was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley's five-step framework. Eight databases (CINAHL, Cochrane-Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched. Included studies were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers with good interrater reliability (k = 0·96). Results: Sixty-six out of 5573 potential studies were included, representing more than 2031 participants. Three tenets of self-regulation were identified - self-monitoring (n 66, 100 %), optimisation of goal setting (n 10, 15·2 %) and self-control (n 10, 15·2 %). Articles were also categorised into three AI applications, namely machine perception (n 50), predictive analytics only (n 6) and real-time analytics with personalised micro-interventions (n 10). Machine perception focused on recognising food items, eating behaviours, physical activities and estimating energy balance. Predictive analytics focused on predicting weight loss, intervention adherence, dietary lapses and emotional eating. Studies on the last theme focused on evaluating AI-assisted weight management interventions that instantaneously collected behavioural data, optimised prediction models for behavioural lapse events and enhance behavioural self-control through adaptive and personalised nudges/prompts. Only six studies reported average weight losses (2·4-4·7 %) of which two were statistically significant. Conclusion: The use of AI for weight loss is still undeveloped. Based on the current study findings, we proposed a framework on the applicability of AI for weight loss but cautioned its contingency upon engagement and contextualisation. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

Development and evaluation of an interactive web-based decision-making programme on relapse management for people with multiple sclerosis (POWER@MS2)—study protocol for a randomised controlled trial,"Rahn, A.C.; Wenzel, L.; Icks, A.; Stahmann, A.; Scheiderbauer, J.; Grentzenberg, K.; Vomhof, M.; Montalbo, J.; Friede, T.; Heesen, C.; Köpke, S.","Introduction: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory, degenerative disease of the central nervous system manifesting at first with relapses in about 85% of cases. In Germany, intravenous therapy with high-dose corticosteroids is the treatment standard of acute relapses. The treatment leads to a faster reduction of symptoms in about 25 of 100 treated patients but has no proven long-term benefits over placebo treatment. Intravenous treatment is not superior to oral treatment. Therefore, informed decisions on relapse management are required. An earlier randomised controlled trial showed that evidence-based patient information and education on relapse management leads to more informed decisions and more relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. This study aims to evaluate whether a web-based relapse management programme will positively change relapse management and strengthen autonomy in people with multiple sclerosis. Methods: The pragmatic double-blind randomised controlled trial is accompanied by a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation and follows the UK Medical Research Council guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions. A total of 188 people with possible or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with ≥ 1 relapse within the last year and/or ≥ 2 relapses within the last 2 years will be recruited and randomised using blocks. The intervention group receives a web- and dialogue-based decision aid on relapse management, a nurse-led webinar and access to a monitored chat forum. The control group receives standard information, which will be made available via the same online platform as the intervention. The primary endpoint is the proportion of relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. Key secondary endpoints are the annualised relapse rate, decision-making, empowerment, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Facilitators and barriers will be assessed by mixed-methods process evaluation measures. The study ends when 81 relapses have been documented or after 24 months of observation per individual patient. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: We hypothesise that the intervention will enhance patient empowerment and have a positive impact on patients’ relapse management.

Knowledge-enhanced Recommender Systems: A Survey and Prospect,"Yang, D.; Xia, X.; Ye, L.; Xue, L.; Xiao, Y.","Personalized recommender systems can provide users with their expected internet resources automatically, rapidly and precisely, based on users' preferences and demands. As the broadly applied information retrieval systems in the big data era, personalized recommender systems have shown great commercial values in various applications. In recent years, the knowledge engineering of big data which takes knowledge graph (KGs) as representative, has become the hot spot in the communities of both industry and academic, thanks to the sharp increasement of the big data on Web, as well as the rapid development and popularization of artificial intelligence technologies. It also promotes recommender systems to step into the phase of being driven and enabled by knowledge. With the rich knowledge in KGs used as valuable side in-formation, the inevitable problems harming traditional recommender systems, such as data sparsity and semantic mismatch, can be addressed well. Moreover, the knowledge is helpful to generate diverse and explainable recommendation results, as well as achieve cross-domain and sequential recommendation. As a result, user experiences in various real recommendation scenarios are enhanced. In this paper, we classify the existing recommendation models incorporating KGs at first, according to their algorithm design and applied recommendation scenarios (tasks), to construct a scientific and reasonable taxonomy. Specifically, according to recommendation algorithm design, we divide the KG-based recommendation models into the class based on feature representation and the class based on graph topology. For recommendation scenarios, we specially focus on diversified recommendation, explainable recommendation, sequential recommendation and cross-domain recommendation. Next, we introduce some representative works respectively for each category, and briefly compare their characteristics including advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, inspired by the current trend of artificial intelligence technologies and various applications, we also try to forecast the development trend of recommender systems with cognitive intelligence. To be specific, these future recommender systems include the systems built with multimodal knowledge and common sense, as well as the explainable, persuasive and polemical recommender systems. The survey and prospect in this paper can provide constructive preferences for future work in the research field of recommender systems. © 2021, China Science Publishing & Media LTD.

Usability and acceptability of a mobile app for behavior change and to improve immunization coverage among children in pakistan: A mixed-methods study,"Kazi, A.M.; Ahsan, N.; Mughis, W.; Jamal, S.; Allana, R.; Raza, M.; Muneer, S.; Mughal, M.A.K.; Kaleemuddin, H.; Sameen, F.; Ahmed, R.M.; Abbasi, M.; Stergioulas, L.K.; Qazi, S.A.","Background: Pakistan’s immunization uptake rates are still significantly lower than anticipated despite several initiatives. Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience. Objective: The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers’ attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan. Methods: A mixed-method design was employed for this study. The study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Hospital. Parents visiting the Community Health Center for 6-week vaccination of their children were recruited. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews that grasped the parent’s attitudes and challenges to immunization, as well as their acceptability and accessibility of the smartphone-based behavior-change application to increase vaccine uptake. Stage 1 was followed by stage 2, in which data were collected through a questionnaire designed by using data from qualitative interviews. Results: The majority of participants agreed that immunization serves an important role in protecting their child from illnesses that cause morbidity and mortality. Almost all of them emphasized the importance of using a pre-appointment method at vaccination center in order to reduce the waiting time. Furthermore, participants were also interested in AI-based behavior modification applications related to immunization. They also wanted to have applications in their native language for better understanding and communication of related information. In our study, approximately 95.2 percent of participants agreed to accept SMS immunization updates, which was also reasonably high. Lastly, the majority of them identified forgetfulness as a significant contributor to regular immunization. Conclusion: To enhance the uptake of childhood vaccines, overall vaccination rates, and overcome barriers related to vaccination coverage, cost-effective and user-friendly mHealth AI-based smart phone applications are required to raise awareness regarding the continuation of vaccination service and the importance of timely vaccination. Parents’ experiences and attitudes must be considered while designing and evaluating the efficacy of mHealth-based interventions. © 2021 by the authors.

Personalization of conversational agent-patient interaction styles for chronic disease management: Two consecutive cross-sectional questionnaire studies,"Gross, C.; Schachner, T.; Hasl, A.; Kohlbrenner, D.; Clarenbach, C.F.; Wangenheim, F.V.; Kowatsch, T.","Background: Conversational agents (CAs) for chronic disease management are receiving increasing attention in academia and the industry. However, long-term adherence to CAs is still a challenge and needs to be explored. Personalization of CAs has the potential to improve long-term adherence and, with it, user satisfaction, task efficiency, perceived benefits, and intended behavior change. Research on personalized CAs has already addressed different aspects, such as personalized recommendations and anthropomorphic cues. However, detailed information on interaction styles between patients and CAs in the role of medical health care professionals is scant. Such interaction styles play essential roles for patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and outcome, as has been shown for physician-patient interactions. Currently, it is not clear (1) whether chronically ill patients prefer a CA with a paternalistic, informative, interpretive, or deliberative interaction style, and (2) which factors influence these preferences. Objective: We aimed to investigate the preferences of chronically ill patients for CA-delivered interaction styles. Methods: We conducted two studies. The first study included a paper-based approach and explored the preferences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for paternalistic, informative, interpretive, and deliberative CA-delivered interaction styles. Based on these results, a second study assessed the effects of the paternalistic and deliberative interaction styles on the relationship quality between the CA and patients via hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses in an online experiment with COPD patients. Patients' sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics served as moderator variables. Results: Study 1 with 117 COPD patients revealed a preference for the deliberative (50/117) and informative (34/117) interaction styles across demographic characteristics. All patients who preferred the paternalistic style over the other interaction styles had more severe COPD (three patients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease class 3 or 4). In Study 2 with 123 newly recruited COPD patients, younger participants and participants with a less recent COPD diagnosis scored higher on interaction-related outcomes when interacting with a CA that delivered the deliberative interaction style (interaction between age and CA type: relationship quality: b=-0.77, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.18; intention to continue interaction: b=-0.49, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.01; working alliance attachment bond: b=-0.65, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.04; working alliance goal agreement: b=-0.59, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.01; interaction between recency of COPD diagnosis and CA type: working alliance goal agreement: b=0.57, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.13). Conclusions: Our results indicate that age and a patient's personal disease experience inform which CA interaction style the patient should be paired with to achieve increased interaction-related outcomes with the CA. These results allow the design of personalized health care CAs with the goal to increase long-term adherence to health-promoting behavior. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Information Delivered by a Chatbot Has a Positive Impact on COVID-19 Vaccines Attitudes and Intentions,"Altay, S.; Hacquin, A.-S.; Chevallier, C.; Mercier, H.","The Coronavirus disease; COVID-19 vaccines will not end the pandemic if they stay in freezers. In many countries, such as France, COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy is high. It is crucial that governments make it as easy as possible for people who want to be vaccinated to do so, but also that they devise communication strategies to address the concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals.We introduce and test on 701 French participants a novel messaging strategy: A chatbot that answers people’s questions about COVID-19 vaccines. We find that interacting with this chatbot for a few minutes significantly increases people’s intentions to get vaccinated (ß = 0.12) and has a positive impact on their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (ß = 0.23).

Is a picture worth a thousand views? Measuring the effects of travel photos on user engagement using deep learning algorithms,"Yim, D.; Malefyt, T.; Khuntia, J.","Travel photos inform and inspire consumers by conveying a first-hand destination experience. Despite the proliferation of consumer-generated travel photos in online travel review sites, deconstructing the effects of photos on consumer engagement remains a challenge to the tourism industry. We provide a framework to process and interpret various photographic elements on user engagement using deep learning algorithms. We posit that a photo can invoke consumers’ subjective interpretations of photos representing authentic, creative, or emotional dimensions of the destination experience. A structured crowdsourced categorization process was deployed to measure the interpretive dimensions of the photos. The objects in photographs are identified using a novel deep learning algorithm for controls. We use narrative framing concepts to theorize their influence on user engagement in an online travel review site setting. Relevant three sets of hypotheses are tested using a large dataset of photo-based travel reviews sampled between 2012 and 2014. A negative zero-inflated binomial regression is used to estimate the effect of subjective interpretation of photos on user engagement, accounting for overdispersed excess zeros associated with count outcomes. Results support the hypotheses. The additional analyses explore other plausible influential attributes to user engagements to complement our main findings. We discuss the theoretical contributions to the online-image-persuasion stream of research and practical implications for online tourist review sites. © 2021, Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.",2021,,Electronic Markets,31,3,619-637,,10.1007/s12525-021-00472-5,,#5705,Yim 2021,,,0
The influence of algorithms on political and dating decisions,"Agudo, U.; Matute, H.","Artificial intelligence algorithms are ubiquitous in daily life, and this is motivating the development of some institutional initiatives to ensure trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there is not enough research on how these algorithms can influence people’s decisions and attitudes. The present research examines whether algorithms can persuade people, explicitly or covertly, on whom to vote and date, or whether, by contrast, people would reject their influence in an attempt to confirm their personal freedom and independence. In four experiments, we found that persuasion was possible and that different styles of persuasion (e.g., explicit, covert) were more effective depending on the decision context (e.g., political and dating). We conclude that it is important to educate people against trusting and following the advice of algorithms blindly. A discussion on who owns and can use the data that makes these algorithms work efficiently is also necessary. Copyright: © 2021 Agudo, Matute.

Persuasive Design for Healthy Eating: A Scoping Review,"Liu, X.; Ren, X.; Pan, S.","In this scoping review, we aimed to summarize and analyze the latest research developments of persuasive design for healthy eating behavior and explore future design opportunities. This paper initially collected 1231 papers from 2011 to 2021 in three different databases: the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library, IEEE Xplore and SpringerLink databases. Based on a selection process, 28 papers that mainly focused on addressing dietary health by persuasive designs were eventually included in final analysis. These 28 papers were sorted by three characteristics: research specifications, methodologies, and design rationales. Our data analyses revealed that the reviewed papers primarily utilized persuasive technologies for eating behaviors monitoring, recording, and healthy eating suggestion. Moreover, six types of design applications were commonly implemented, including mobile applications, persuasive messages, digital products and service systems, wearable devices, chatbots/assistants, and public devices. Our review showed that persuasive design, as a generic approach for promoting healthy eating, lacked research investigations on personalized solutions for particular user groups such as office workers and teenagers. Future works could explore persuasive design strategies by applying the research factors of user experience and examining the efficacy of persuasive technology tools to effectively promote healthy eating behaviors for various user groups in different contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2022,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13326 LNCS,,292-303,,10.1007/978-3-031-05431-0_20,,#5707,Liu 2022,,,0
Systematic review of context-aware digital behavior change interventions to improve health,"Craig, K.J.T.; Morgan, L.C.; Chen, C.-H.; Michie, S.; Fusco, N.; Snowdon, J.L.; Scheufele, E.; Gagliardi, T.; Sill, S.","Health risk behaviors are leading contributors to morbidity, premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, and escalating health costs. However, traditional interventions to change health behaviors often have modest effects, and limited applicability and scale. To better support health improvement goals across the care continuum, new approaches incorporating various smart technologies are being utilized to create more individualized digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). The purpose of this study is to identify context-aware DBCIs that provide individualized interventions to improve health. A systematic review of published literature (2013-2020) was conducted from multiple databases and manual searches. All included DBCIs were context-aware, automated digital health technologies, whereby user input, activity, or location influenced the intervention. Included studies addressed explicit health behaviors and reported data of behavior change outcomes. Data extracted from studies included study design, type of intervention, including its functions and technologies used, behavior change techniques, and target health behavior and outcomes data. Thirty-three articles were included, comprising mobile health (mHealth) applications, Internet of Things wearables/sensors, and internet-based web applications. The most frequently adopted behavior change techniques were in the groupings of feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning. Technologies used to apply these in a context-aware, automated fashion included analytic and artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning and symbolic reasoning) methods requiring various degrees of access to data. Studies demonstrated improvements in physical activity, dietary behaviors, medication adherence, and sun protection practices. Context-aware DBCIs effectively supported behavior change to improve users' health behaviors.  © 2020 ",2021,,Translational Behavioral Medicine,11,5,1037-1048,,10.1093/tbm/ibaa099,,#5708,Craig 2021,,,0
Study on Control Strategy for Tilt-rotor Aircraft Conversion Procedure,"Yan, X.; Chen, R.; Lou, B.; Xie, Y.; Xie, A.; Zhang, D.","This paper studies the control strategy in tilt-rotor aircraft dynamic conversion procedure. A nonlinear flight dynamics model with full flight modes is established. On this basis, a nonlinear optimal control model of dynamic conversion is built by constructing the Bolza form of nonlinear optimal control problem. It contains the limitations and effects of conversion corridor, pilot control, flight attitude, engine rated power, wing stall, and the cooperation between lift and thrust on the procedure of dynamic conversion. An efficient numerical solution method with good convergence is designed to obtain the trajectory and control strategy of dynamic conversion between the modes of helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft. Through the weight parameter analysis, it can be seen that when the subitem of pilot workload is included in the cost function, the displacements of collective stick input as well as the longitudinal stick input are significantly reduced, and the height and pitch attitude change more gently, but the time has been extended. In addition, the pilot workload weight coefficient should not be dominant, otherwise the overly smooth manipulations of collective and longitudinal stick will cause a decrease of height.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",2021,,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,1924,1,,,10.1088/1742-6596/1924/1/012010,,#5709,Yan 2021,,,0
Understanding the emotional response to COVID-19 information in news and social media: A mental health perspective,"Jones, R.; Mougouei, D.; Evans, S.L.","The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions has been profound, affecting the health, livelihoods, and wellbeing of populations worldwide. Studies have shown widespread effects on mental health, with an increase in stress, loneliness, and depression symptoms related to the pandemic. Media plays a critical role in containing and managing crises, by informing society and fostering positive behavior change. Social restrictions have led to a large increase in reliance on online media channels, and this can influence mental health and wellbeing. Anxiety levels, for instance, may be exacerbated by exposure to COVID-related content, contagion of negative sentiment among social networks, and “fake news.” In some cases, this may trigger abstinence, leading to isolation and limited access to vital information. To be able to communicate distressing news during crises while protecting the wellbeing of individuals is not trivial; it requires a deeper understanding of people's emotional response to online and social media content. This paper selectively reviews research into consequences of social media usage and online news consumption for wellbeing and mental health, focusing on and discussing their effects in the context of the pandemic. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, for example, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Recognition, are discussed as useful methods for investigating effects on population mental health as the pandemic situation evolves. We present suggestions for future research, and for using these advances to assess large data sets of users' online content, to potentially inform strategies that enhance the mental health of social media users going forward. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.",2021,,Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies,3,5,832-842,,10.1002/hbe2.304,,#5710,Jones 2021,,,0

Guided by the anthropomorphism literature and parasocial interaction theory, this study investigated how the new unique relationship between consumers and artificial intelligence-powered voice assistants may affect the way consumers evaluate the recommended products through two experiments. Study 1 (n = 85, students) employed a 2 (shopping medium type: voice assistant vs. website) × 2 (interaction style: task-oriented vs. socially-oriented) between-subjects design lab experiment. Study 2 (n = 418, Mechanical Turk) employed a 2 (shopping medium type: voice assistant vs. website) × 2 (product type: search vs. experience) between-subjects online experiment. The results suggested that consumers may perceive voice assistants as pseudohuman agents detached from the service provider while perceiving websites as a tool or interface used by the provider, resulting in a more positive perception and evaluation of websites. As one of the few studies investigating voice assistants from the consumer perspective, this study contributes to the growing body of research in voice assistants.

A review of AI and Data Science support for cancer management,"Parimbelli, E.; Wilk, S.; Cornet, R.; Sniatala, P.; Sniatala, K.; Glaser, S.L.C.; Fraterman, I.; Boekhout, A.H.; Ottaviano, M.; Peleg, M.","Introduction: Thanks to improvement of care, cancer has become a chronic condition. But due to the toxicity of treatment, the importance of supporting the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients increases. Monitoring and managing QoL relies on data collected by the patient in his/her home environment, its integration, and its analysis, which supports personalization of cancer management recommendations. We review the state-of-the-art of computerized systems that employ AI and Data Science methods to monitor the health status and provide support to cancer patients managed at home. Objective: Our main objective is to analyze the literature to identify open research challenges that a novel decision support system for cancer patients and clinicians will need to address, point to potential solutions, and provide a list of established best-practices to adopt. Methods: We designed a review study, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing studies retrieved from PubMed related to monitoring cancer patients in their home environments via sensors and self-reporting: what data is collected, what are the techniques used to collect data, semantically integrate it, infer the patient's state from it and deliver coaching/behavior change interventions. Results: Starting from an initial corpus of 819 unique articles, a total of 180 papers were considered in the full-text analysis and 109 were finally included in the review. Our findings are organized and presented in four main sub-topics consisting of data collection, data integration, predictive modeling and patient coaching. Conclusion: Development of modern decision support systems for cancer needs to utilize best practices like the use of validated electronic questionnaires for quality-of-life assessment, adoption of appropriate information modeling standards supplemented by terminologies/ontologies, adherence to FAIR data principles, external validation, stratification of patients in subgroups for better predictive modeling, and adoption of formal behavior change theories. Open research challenges include supporting emotional and social dimensions of well-being, including PROs in predictive modeling, and providing better customization of behavioral interventions for the specific population of cancer patients. © 2021 The Authors",2021,,Artificial Intelligence in Medicine,117,,,,10.1016/j.artmed.2021.102111,,#5712,Parimbelli 2021,,,0
Master and Slave: the Dialectic of Human-Artificial Intelligence Engagement,"Kim, T.W.; Maimone, F.; Pattit, K.; Sison, A.J.; Teehankee, B.","The massive introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has triggered significant societal concerns, ranging from “technological unemployment” and the dominance of algorithms in the work place and in everyday life, among others. While AI is made by humans and is, therefore, dependent on the latter for its purpose, the increasing capabilities of AI to carry out productive activities for humans can lead the latter to unwitting slavish existence. This has become evident, for example, in the area of social media use, where AI programmers tie psychology and persuasion to the human social need for approval and validation in ways that few users can resist. We argue that AI should serve humans with humans as masters and not the other way around. Moreover, we propose that virtue ethics might play a role to solidify the human as master of AI and guard against the alternative of AI as the master. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Humanistic Management Journal,6,3,355-371,,10.1007/s41463-021-00118-w,,#5713,Kim 2021,,,0
Identifying and Responding to Health Misinformation on Reddit Dermatology Forums with Artificially Intelligent Bots Using Natural Language Processing: Design and Evaluation Study,"Sager, M.A.; Kashyap, A.M.; Tamminga, M.; Ravoori, S.; Callison-Burch, C.; Lipoff, J.B.","Background: Reddit, the fifth most popular website in the United States, boasts a large and engaged user base on its dermatology forums where users crowdsource free medical opinions. Unfortunately, much of the advice provided is unvalidated and could lead to the provision of inappropriate care. Initial testing has revealed that artificially intelligent bots can detect misinformation regarding tanning and essential oils on Reddit dermatology forums and may be able to produce responses to posts containing misinformation. Objective: To analyze the ability of bots to find and respond to tanning and essential oil–related health misinformation on Reddit’s dermatology forums in a controlled test environment. Methods: Using natural language processing techniques, we trained bots to target misinformation, using relevant keywords and to post prefabricated responses. By evaluating different model architectures across a held-out test set, we compared performances. Results: Our models yielded data test accuracies ranging 95%-100%, with a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) fine-tuned model resulting in the highest level of test accuracy. Bots were then able to post corrective prefabricated responses to misinformation in a test environment. Conclusions: Using a limited data set, bots accurately detected examples of health misinformation within Reddit dermatology forums. Given that these bots can then post prefabricated responses, this technique may allow for interception of misinformation. Providing correct information does not mean that users will be receptive or find such interventions persuasive. Further studies should investigate this strategy’s effectiveness to inform future deployment of bots as a technique in combating health misinformation. ©Monique A Sager, Aditya M Kashyap, Mila Tamminga, Sadhana Ravoori, Christopher Callison-Burch, Jules B Lipoff.",2021,,JMIR Dermatology,4,2,,,10.2196/20975,,#5714,Sager 2021,,,0
Study on computer vision target tracking algorithm based on sparse representation,"Ma, W.; Xu, F.","Video target tracking covers a variety of interdisciplinary subjects such as pattern recognition, image processing, computer graphics and artificial intelligence. In recent years, visual tracking research methods have made significant progress, and scholars have proposed many excellent algorithms. Based on this, this paper uses the basic tracking algorithm and block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm of image reconstruction, respectively, from the run time, the quality of reconstruction, reconstruction error of the two algorithms to do simulation experiments, and compare their performance, the results show that the BOMP algorithm running time is short, has extensive application, therefore, to determine the BOMP algorithm as a sparse representation model is the core of the method. Then establish the target observation model, introduce the sparse display into the particle filter framework, and update the sparse representation coefficients so that the norm reaches the optimal solution and ensure the accuracy of the tracking target. Finally, through the simulation experiment, the success rate of the target coverage is calculated.

Sentence classification for contract law cases: A natural language processing approach,"Mok, J.R.; Mok, W.Y.; Mok, R.V.","Legal practice can gain much from advances in machine learning and A.I. technology. Common law countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, rely on judicial precedent to decide what law governs new cases and how that law is applied. Judicial precedent is the body of case law that observes how past courts have decided similar cases. Case law is composed of individual case decisions by courts that resolve a particular dispute. When resolving new cases, courts look back on judicial precedent to structure how to decide said new cases. Thus, an extensive knowledge base of how prior cases have been decided under what law is needed in each field of legal practice. Legal research is the practice of identifying relevant case law for a particular set of facts and is essential for any practitioner seeking to make the most persuasive argument for clients. Reviewing case law and identifying relevant cases can be time consuming and imperfect; there is always risk that practitioners overlook relevant and/or new case law that has changed the legal landscape of their practice. Thus practitioners are not only required to retain an extensive knowledge base of relevant case law, but also to keep abreast of changes in case law.  © 2021 Owner/Author.",2021,,"Proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law, ICAIL 2021",,,260-261,,10.1145/3462757.3466074,,#5716,Mok 2021,,,0
Audio Mining: The Role of Vocal Tone in Persuasion,"Wang, X.; Lu, S.; Li, X.; Khamitov, M.; Bendle, N.","Persuasion success is often related to hard-to-measure characteristics, such as the way the persuader speaks. To examine how vocal tones impact persuasion in an online appeal, this research measures persuaders' vocal tones in Kickstarter video pitches using novel audio mining technology. Connecting vocal tone dimensions with real-world funding outcomes offers insight into the impact of vocal tones on receivers' actions. The core hypothesis of this paper is that a successful persuasion attempt is associated with vocal tones denoting (1) focus, (2) low stress, and (3) stable emotions. These three vocal tone dimensions - which are in line with the stereotype content model - matter because they allow receivers to make inferences about a persuader's competence. The hypotheses are tested with a large-scale empirical study using Kickstarter data, which is then replicated in a different category. In addition, two controlled experiments provide evidence that perceptions of competence mediate the impact of the three vocal tones on persuasion attempt success.

A cyber physical system for managing customer relations,"Banerjee, A.; Roychoudhury, B.; Gogoi, B.J.","Maintaining customer–company relationship is very important from the perspective of business. It helps to gain new customers as well as retain existing customers, even the dissatisfied ones, through SIoT based informal and humble counseling. Full form of SIoT is social internet of things where smart objects communicate via social networks to extract required information and propagate suitable ones to identify potential customers and counsel them online. These objects are equipped with machine intelligence so that they can make friends in social networks, collaborate with each other to achieve a common goal, update relationship status and level of trustworthiness between them. Using social network connectivity different groups can be created, where satisfied and brand sincere customers can support company-engaged smart objects to convince or persuade prospective buyers. Convincing also includes the provision of humble and honest apologizing for poor quality customer service which the concerned person might have experienced earlier from company of the object. This may be difficult for a human being because of his underlying nature or characteristics like ego, anger etc. but becomes extremely easy for smart objects because they are devoid of human emotions and enabled by machine intelligence only. Research has proved that behavioral optimization techniques are capable of significantly improving a company’s sales record. Therefore, we can emphatically say that SIoT can be of great help to increase sales of a company.

A Big Data and Artificial Intelligence Framework for Smart and Personalized Air Pollution Monitoring and Health Management in Hong Kong,"Li, V.O.K.; Lam, J.C.K.; Han, Y.; Chow, K.","All people in the world are entitled to enjoy a clean environment and a good quality of life. With big data and artificial intelligence technologies, it is possible to estimate personalized air pollution exposure and synchronize it with activity, health, quality of life and behavioural data, and provide real-time, personalized and interactive alert and advice to improve the health and well-being of individual citizens. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM2.5 and PM1.0 and NO2) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM1.0 and PM2.5, NO2 exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change. Our novel big data AI-driven approach, when integrated with other analytical approaches, provides an integrated interdisciplinary framework for personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, easily transferrable to and applicable in other domains and countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",2021,,Environmental Science and Policy,124,,441-450,,10.1016/j.envsci.2021.06.011,,#5723,Li 2021,,,0

A recommender system that safeguards the user privacy through federated learning,"Guillen, I.; Sanchez-Corcuera, R.; Casado-Mansilla, D.","Nowadays, there are more and more legal and ethical limitations when it comes to managing personal data. This is a serious problem for recommender systems (RS) or similar aplications since personal data (e.g. socioeconomic, demographics, behavioural, etc.) are the most useful for generating tailored correlations and predictions. To cope with this issue, this work proposes a recommender system that safeguards the user privacy by using a Federated Learning approach (FL). To this end, this article takes as the baseline an already existing centralized RS that uses all the data from users in a clear manner. This baseline RS is based on Factor Machines and it aims to employ persuasion strategies adapted to the user to increase energy awareness and change their consumption habits in the work environment. In order to test the performance of the FL-based distributed RS, the real dataset used (N=678) have been separated into four subsets mimicking a segmentation by country of origin (Austria, UK, Spain and Greece). Each country can create an artificial intelligence model suitable for its users that will be sent to a central server where the aggregation of models will take place and the improved global model will be returned back to each country. The simulation of this FL strategy is performed with four Raspberry Pi's reflecting each country and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano is used as the aggregation server. The generated model not only increases the privacy of the users as no raw data travels to the central server but also improves the reliability of the recommendations. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.",2021,,"2021 6th International Conference on Smart and Sustainable Technologies, SpliTech 2021",,,,,10.23919/SpliTech52315.2021.9566466,,#5728,Guillen 2021,,,0
A Proposed Gamification Elements of Educational Games,"Elaish, M.M.; Hussein, M.H.; Shuib, L.; Wan Ahmad, W.F.; Becker, K.","Research interest in gamification is currently enjoying global attention. However, while game design is often the focus of these gamification systems, interface design is overlooked. This is due to the expectations of field stakeholders and experts who consider interface to be only a minor element of the gamification experience. The aim of this paper is to propose a classification method that categorizes the gamification element into tangible and intangible. This new classification would provide a clear perspective about the elements before the design and development of an educational game has even begun. The proposed new method of classification would save researcher's time and effort by assisting in the selection of the most appropriate gamification elements for the situation at hand. © 2021 IEEE.",2021,,"Proceedings - International Conference on Computer and Information Sciences: Sustaining Tomorrow with Digital Innovation, ICCOINS 2021",,,14-17,,10.1109/ICCOINS49721.2021.9497179,,#5730,Elaish 2021,,,0
The Use of a Tablet to Increase Older Adults’ Exercise Adherence,"Mehra, S.; van den Helder, J.; Kröse, B.J.A.; Engelbert, R.H.H.; Weijs, P.J.M.; Visser, B.","Sufficient physical activity can prolong the ability of older adults to live independently. Community-based exercise programs can be enhanced by regularly performing exercises at home. To support such a home-based exercise program, a blended intervention was developed that combined the use of a tablet application with a personal coach. The purpose of the current study was to explore to which extent tablet engagement predicted exercise adherence and physical activity. The results show that older adults (n = 133; M = 71 years of age) that participated 6 months in a randomized controlled trial, performed at average 12 home-based exercised per week and exercised on average 3 days per week, thereby meeting WHO guidelines. They used the tablet app on average 7 times per week. Multiple linear regressions revealed that the use of the app predicted the number of exercises that were performed and the number of exercise days. We conclude that engagement with a tablet can contribute to sustained exercise behavior. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12684 LNCS,,47-54,,10.1007/978-3-030-79460-6_4,,#5731,Mehra 2021,,,0
An Optimal Initial Foot Position for Quadruped Robots in Trot Gait,"He, D.","Gait planning parameters are important for quadruped robots to walk stably. In this paper, application of inverted pendulum model is widdened and a new collision model of quadruped trotting between feet and the ground that can indicate body-attitude changes in walking is established. Influences of initial foot position, walking cyclic period and stride length on walking stability are discussed. The influence varies with different initial foot positons and we get the optimal initial foot position for the quadruped in trot gait with minimum variation in body attitude and maximum walking stability. Finally, we get the optimal initial foot position and walking cyclic period with minimal collision velocity.

Delving into Variance Transmission and Normalization: Shift of Average Gradient Makes the Network Collapse,"Liu, Y.; Ge, J.; Li, C.; Gui, J.","Normalization operations are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks and enable us to train a network from scratch with a large learning rate (LR). We attempt to explain the real effect of Batch Normalization (BN) from the perspective of variance transmission by investigating the relationship between BN and Weights Normalization (WN). In this work, we demonstrate that the problem of the shift of the average gradient will amplify the variance of every convolutional (conv) layer. We propose Parametric Weights Standardization (PWS), a fast and robust to mini-batch size module used for conv filters, to solve the shift of the average gradient. PWS can provide the speed-up of BN. Besides, it has less computation and does not change the output of a conv layer. PWS enables the network to converge fast without normalizing the outputs. This result enhances the persuasiveness of the shift of the average gradient and explains why BN works from the perspective of variance transmission.

The disruptive power of Artificial Intelligence. Ethical aspects of gerontechnology in elderly care,"Rubeis, G.","Gerontechnology based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to fulfill the promise of the so-called 4p-medicine and enable a predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory elderly care. Although empirical evidence shows positive health outcomes, commentators are concerned that AI-based gerontechnology could bring along the disruption of elderly care. A systematic conceptualization of these concerns is lacking. In this paper, such a conceptualization is suggested by analyzing the risks of AI in elderly care as “4d-risks”: the depersonalization of care through algorithm-based standardization, the discrimination of minority groups through generalization, the dehumanization of the care relationship through automatization, and the disciplination of users through monitoring and surveillance. Based on the 4d-model, strategies for a patient-centered AI in elderly care are outlined. Whether AI-based gerontechnology will actualize the 4p-perspective or bring about the 4d-scenario depends on whether joint efforts of users, caregivers, care providers, engineers, and policy makers will be made. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",2020,,Archives of Gerontology and Geriatrics,91,,,,10.1016/j.archger.2020.104186,,#5734,Rubeis 2020,,,0
The Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence Conversational Agents in Health Care: Systematic Review,"Milne-Ives, M.; de Cock, C.; Lim, E.; Shehadeh, M.H.; de Pennington, N.; Mole, G.; Normando, E.; Meinert, E.","Background: The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption. Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents. Methods: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another. Results: A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback. Conclusions: The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents. ©Madison Milne-Ives, Caroline de Cock, Ernest Lim, Melissa Harper Shehadeh, Nick de Pennington, Guy Mole, Eduardo Normando, Edward Meinert.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,10,,,10.2196/20346,,#5736,Milne-Ives 2020,,,0
The influences of the COVID-19 pandemic on medical service behaviors,"Chang, W.-H.","The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has greatly impacted medical services worldwide. In addition to changing the processes used by hospital medical services, it has also changed the behaviors of medical staff, resulting in a completely different appearance. Fear of being infected with COVID-19 makes patients fear entering hospitals, and hospitals must repeatedly screen patients prior to entry in order to confirm that they are not infected. Patients are then separated according to their symptoms and travel, occupation, contact and cluster histories (TOCC), which seriously affects them. In addition, hospitals have invested a lot of money into the whole visiting process and into the equipment required to prevent the spread or lessen the impact of COVID-19. © 2020",2020,,Taiwanese Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology,59,6,821-827,,10.1016/j.tjog.2020.09.007,,#5737,Chang 2020,,,0
Multidisciplinary efforts in combating nonadherence to medication and health care interventions: Opportunities and challenges for operations researchers,"Prakash, A.M.; Vega, C.; Diaby, V.; Zhong, X.","Chronic diseases are a growing concern in public health. Lack of adherence to medications and health care interventions is a major factor behind the worsening of chronic disease outcomes and large medical costs. As a result, there is a critical need to identify structural, systematic, and patient-centric barriers to adherence. Similarly important is the development of models and deployable strategies to ensure effective delivery of care so that clinical and economic outcomes are optimized. This commentary review explores the research on nonadherence of patients with chronic diseases and other non-acute conditions to medications and interventions from different disciplinary perspectives, including medicine/pharmacy, pharmacoeconomics, behavioral economics, operations research (OR), and data analytics (DA). Although a spate of works has been conducted in the medicine and pharmacy fields, the contribution of OR/DA to medication/intervention nonadherence is limited. Given the technological advancement and the increasing understanding of nonadherence, we believe that OR/DA can play an essential role in encapsulating the domain knowledge and catalyzing the development of patient-centric solutions. We discuss the challenges and opportunities presented to OR/DA researchers and conclude the commentary with a discussion on new interdisciplinary research directions that can contribute to solving the nonadherence puzzle. © 2021 “IISE”.",2021,,IISE Transactions on Healthcare Systems Engineering,11,3,255-270,,10.1080/24725579.2021.1953639,,#5738,Prakash 2021,,,0

"The Internet of No Things: Making the Internet Disappear and ""See the Invisible""","Maier, M.; Ebrahimzadeh, A.; Rostami, S.; Beniiche, A.","Future emerging communication technologies are anticipated to fold into our surroundings, helping us get our noses off the smartphone screens and back into our environments. In doing so, they make us more (rather than less) present in the world around us. While 5G was supposed to be about the Internet of Everything, to be transformative 6G might be just about the opposite of Everything, that is, Nothing or, more technically, No Things. Building on the invisible-to-visible technology concept, this article explores how the full potential of multisensory extended reality (XR) experiences may be unleashed in Multiverse cross-reality environments. We exploit the convergence of artificial-intelligence-enhanced multi-access edge computing, intelligent mobile robots, and blockchain technologies to help realize the Internet of No Things as an important stepping stone toward ushering in the 6G post-smartphone era. In our experiments, we consider locally connected human-avatar/robot collectives and investigate our proposed extrasensory perception network, which integrates the three evolutionary mobile computing stages of ubiquitous, pervasive, and persuasive computing.

The Internet as Cognitive Enhancement,"Voinea, C.; Vică, C.; Mihailov, E.; Savulescu, J.","The Internet has been identified in human enhancement scholarship as a powerful cognitive enhancement technology. It offers instant access to almost any type of information, along with the ability to share that information with others.

The Internet is not a simple, uniform technology, either in its composition, or in its use. We will look into why the Internet as an informational resource currently fails to enhance cognition. We analyze some of the phenomena that emerge from vast, continual fluxes of information–information overload, misinformation and persuasive design—and show how they could negatively impact users’ cognition.

Burdens of Persuasion and Standards of Proof in Structured Argumentation,"Calegari, R.; Sartor, G.","In this paper we provide an account of the burden of persuasion, in the context of structured argumentation. First, burdens of proof in legal proceedings are discussed in general, distinguishing the burdens of production and the burdens of persuasion. Then, we focus on burdens of persuasion, illustrating their role in civil and criminal law. A formal model for the burden of persuasion is then defined, discussed, and used to capture the role of the burden of persuasion in adjudicating conflicts between conflicting arguments and in determining the dialectical status of arguments. We consider how our model can also capture adversarial burdens of proof, namely, those cases in which failure to establish an argument for a proposition burdened with persuasion entails establishing the complementary proposition. Finally, we examine how burdens of proofs can be integrated with standards of proof defining the extent to which an argument for a proposition burdened with persuasion has to be stronger than arguments to the contrary, in order to meet the burden. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13040 LNAI,,40-59,,10.1007/978-3-030-89391-0_3,,#5744,Calegari 2021,,,0

An empirical study on group fairness metrics of judicial data,"Li, Y.; Huang, H.; Guo, X.; Yuan, Y.","Group fairness means that different groups have an equal probability of being predicted for one aspect. It is a significant fairness definition, which is conducive to maintaining social harmony and stability. Fairness is a vital issue when an artificial intelligence software system is used to make judicial decisions. Either data or algorithm alone may lead to unfair results. Determining the fairness of the dataset is a prerequisite for studying the fairness of algorithms. This paper focuses on the dataset to research group fairness from both micro and macro views. We propose a framework to determine the sensitive attributes of a dataset and metrics to measure the fair degree of sensitive attributes. We conducted experiments and statistical analysis of the judicial data to demonstrate the framework and metric approach better. The framework and metric approach can be applied to datasets of other domains, providing persuasive evidence for the effectiveness and availability of algorithmic fairness research.

Self-reported bleeding on brushing as a predictor of bleeding on probing: Early observations from the deployment of an internet of things network of intelligent power-driven toothbrushes in a supportive periodontal care population,"Tonetti, M.S.; Deng, K.; Christiansen, A.; Bogetti, K.; Nicora, C.; Thurnay, S.; Cortellini, P.","Background: Bleeding on brushing (BoB) is an important sign of gingival inflammation. Recently, the use of intelligent toothbrushes and oral health Apps has shown potential to improve oral and periodontal health. In the context of the introduction of an Internet of things network of intelligent power-driven toothbrushes in a supportive periodontal care programme, the aim of this study was (a) to audit the adoption and retention of this new technology; and (b) to preliminarily assess the feasibility to gather data on BoB and associate them with clinical periodontal parameters. Methods: 100 subjects with different periodontal case diagnoses participating in supportive periodontal care (SPC) were provided with and instructed on the use of an intelligent power-driven toothbrush connected with an App (I-Brush). Brushing sessions and occurrence of BoB were recorded through the App and stored in a data protection compliant backend. Subject retention was audited over time. BoB recorded in the two weeks before the SPC appointment was associated with clinical parameters observed by the clinician blind to App data. Results: 75% of subjects provided data from using the power toothbrush and the App for a minimum of 10 brushing sessions over an average period of 362 days. Compared with baseline, subjects’ oral hygiene, bleeding on probing and prevalence of residual pockets improved gradually while using the I-Brush. The number of BoB episodes in the two weeks leading to the SPC appointment and the number of residual pockets predicted BOP (p '.001) detected during the examination. App use in the previous two weeks was associated with lower plaque scores at SPC. Conclusions: These preliminary observations indicate good adoption and retention of a mobile health system built around an intelligent power toothbrush in a SPC population. The App was able to gather clinically relevant information predicting the observed degree of gingival inflammation. Deployment of mHealth systems seems feasible in dental practice and may bring significant oral health benefits. More investigations are needed in this area. © 2020 The Authors.

An Autonomous Lane-Changing System with Knowledge Accumulation and Transfer Assisted by Vehicular Blockchain,"Fu, Y.; Li, C.; Yu, F.R.; Luan, T.H.; Zhang, Y.","Inappropriate lane following and changing behaviors of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can result in accidents, such as rear-end collision and side collision. To remedy that, the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for autonomous driving decisions is currently a widely used promising solution. In this case, the accuracy and effectiveness of such a machine learning (ML) model is quite essential for this artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled CAVs. This article proposes a blockchain-based collective learning (BCL) framework for autonomous lane-changing systems. Four key issues, namely, learning efficiency, data security, users' privacy, as well as communication burden, are addressed by applying collective learning, vehicular blockchain, and knowledge transfer. First, we model the lane-changing problem as a DRL process and learn the autonomous lane-changing strategy through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Second, a single CAV involves a limited number of driving scenarios, and the independent learning method has the problem of inefficiency. Therefore, we propose a collective learning framework to utilize the 'collective intelligence' shared by CAVs. Third, a vehicular blockchain is then applied to ensure the security and privacy of the user and data. In addition, the introduction of the blockchain can incentivize more users to participate in collective learning. Finally, in order to accelerate the learning process and achieve higher level performance while further reducing the communication burden, we use the corresponding knowledge extracted from the ML model such as human learning, as privileged information for sharing instead of directly sharing local ML models. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal in terms of learning efficiency, driving safety, as well as system security and robustness. © 2014 IEEE.",2020,,IEEE Internet of Things Journal,7,11,11123-11136,,10.1109/JIOT.2020.2994975,,#5749,Fu 2020,,,0
Introduce structural equation modelling to machine learning problems for building an explainable and persuasive model,"Li, J.; Sawaragi, T.; Horiguchi, Y.","With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, the high accuracy of machine learning methods has become a non-unique standard.

Player Types and Game Element Preferences: Investigating the Relationship with the Gamification User Types HEXAD Scale,"Krath, J.; von Korflesch, H.F.O.","Gamification has gained scientific attention as a motivational tool for behavior change in various contexts. When designing gamification, several scholars emphasize the importance of tailoring content to the needs of different users, e.g. by using the gamification user types HEXAD typology. From a theoretical point of view, researchers suggest correlations between HEXAD types and certain game elements, but empirical validation of these assumptions is still lacking. Previous studies show limitations either in terms of sample size or comprehensiveness of analysis. Therefore, this study aims to empirically identify game element preferences of different HEXAD types and to validate both the English and a corresponding German version of the HEXAD scale in a quantitative study design with 1,073 participants. The validation shows that the HEXAD scale is a valuable tool for identifying HEXAD types, with some improvements needed for a better model fit. Correlation analysis shows highly significant correlations between HEXAD types and specific game elements. While Philanthropists are motivated by gifting, administrative roles, and knowledge sharing, Free Spirits prefer creativity tools, exploratory tasks, and learning. Both Achievers and Players like challenges, leaderboards, levels, and competition, but Players are additionally attracted by extrinsic elements such as achievements, points, and rewards.

Dialogue management in conversational agents through psychology of persuasion and machine learning,"Carfora, V.; Di Massimo, F.; Rastelli, R.; Catellani, P.; Piastra, M.","To be really effective, conversational agents must integrate well with the characteristics of the humans with whom they interact. This exploratory study focuses on a method for integrating well-assessed methods from the field of social psychology in the design of task-oriented conversational agents in which the dialogue management module is developed through machine learning. In particular, the aim is to achieve agents whose policies could take into account the psychological features of the human interactants to deliver personalized and more effective messages. The paper presents the psychological study performed and outlines the overall theoretical architecture of the software framework proposed. On the psychosocial side, we first assessed the effectiveness of differently framed messages aimed to reducing red meat consumption taking the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the psychosocial model of reference. Turning to the machine learning field, the resulting Structural Equation Model (SEM) was first translated into a probabilistic predictor using Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In turn, such DBN became the fundamental element of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) in a reinforcement learning setting. The possibility to elicit complete interaction policies was then studied by applying Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (Neural MCTS) methods. The results thus obtained introduce the possibility to develop new multidisciplinary and integrated techniques for the development of automated dialogue managing systems. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2020,,Multimedia Tools and Applications,79,47-48,35949-35971,,10.1007/s11042-020-09178-w,,#5754,Carfora 2020,,,0

"Influencing Choices by Changing Beliefs: A Logical Theory of Influence, Persuasion, and Deception","Bonnet, G.; Leturc, C.; Lorini, E.; Sartor, G.","We model persuasion, viewed as a deliberate action through which an agent (persuader) changes the beliefs of another agent’s (persuadee). This notion of persuasion paves the way to express the idea of persuasive influence, namely inducing a change in the choices of the persuadee by changing her beliefs. It allows in turns to express different aspects of deception. To this end, we propose a logical framework that enables expressing actions and capabilities of agents, their mental states (desires, knowledge and beliefs), a variety of agency operators as well as the connection between mental states and choices. Those notions, once combined, enable us to capture, the notion of influence, persuasion and deception, as well as their relation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,1296 CCIS,,124-141,,10.1007/978-3-030-91779-1_9,,#5756,Bonnet 2021,,,0
Minimax strategy for lane choice prediction in markovian traffic modeling,"Pop, M.-D.; Prostean, O.; Prostean, G.","Daily, vehicles overload the road networks. Starting from this worldwide issue, we can see the necessity of finding solutions for travel times improvements. Many solutions arise if we look at the lowest possible level in traffic modeling. At the microscopic level, we can have the best overview of the vehicle's interactions, about their velocity, acceleration or lane change behavior. This paper proposes a new approach of lane choice prediction using an AI (Artificial Intelligence) based gaming strategy. Having a piece of road with the lane change action modeled as Markovian process, for a chosen vehicle, this paper aims to find the best decision considering the desired destination and the involved costs. The lane change action will be described as a game where is involved the vehicle that initiates the action, together with parameters as traffic destination volumes, intermediary traffic volumes associated with distinct lanes and the placement of lanes splitting points. The comparison with the Dijkstra's algorithm, known as the optimal for route choice problem solving, proves the efficiency of the proposed approach. The similar results obtained as destination volumes by comparing with the mentioned optimal algorithm consists of a validation step in this paper proposal. © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,"Proceedings - 2020 5th International Conference on Logistics Operations Management, GOL 2020",,,,,10.1109/GOL49479.2020.9314764,,#5757,Pop 2020,,,0
On the Bayesian Rational Assumption in Information Design,"Tang, W.; Chien-Ju, H.","We study the problem of information design in human-in-theloop systems, where the sender (the system) aims to design an information disclosure policy to influence the receiver (the user) in making decisions. This problem is ubiquitous in systems with humans in the loop, e.g., recommendation systems might choose whether to present others’ reviews to encourage users to follow recommendations, online retailers might choose which set of product features to present to persuade buyers to make the purchase. Among the flourish literature on information design, Bayesian persuasion has been one of the most prominent efforts in formalizing this problem and has spurred various research studies in both economics and computer science. While there has been significant progress in characterizing the optimal information disclosure policies and the corresponding computational complexity, one common assumption in this line of research is that the receiver is Bayesian rational, i.e., the receiver processes the information in a Bayesian manner and takes actions to maximize her expected utility. However, as empirically observed in the literature, this assumption might not be true in real-world scenarios. In this work, we relax this common Bayesian rational assumption in information design in the persuasion setting. In particular, we develop an alternative framework for information design based on discrete choice model and probability weighting to account for this relaxation. Moreover, we conduct online behavioral experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk and demonstrate that our framework better explains real world user behavior and leads to more effective information design policy. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Efficacy of a smartphone-based coaching program for addiction prevention among apprentices: study protocol of a cluster-randomised controlled trial,"Haug, S.; Castro, R.P.; Wenger, A.; Schaub, M.P.","Background: A large proportion of apprentices shows addictive behaviours like cigarette smoking, alcohol, cannabis, or compulsive Internet use, others do not show such behaviours at all. ready4life is a smartphone application-based coaching program for apprentices, which takes into account the heterogeneity of adolescent addictive behaviour by promoting life skills and reducing risk behaviours. The main objective of the planned study is to test the efficacy of ready4life for addiction prevention among apprentices in Switzerland within a controlled trial. Methods/design: The efficacy of the ready4life coaching program will be tested in comparison to an assessment only control group, within a cluster-randomised controlled trial with one follow-up assessment after 6 months. At the beginning of the program, participants of the intervention group will receive an individual profile, showing areas in which they have sufficient resources and in which there is a need for coaching. Based on this feedback, they can select two out of the following six program modules: stress, social skills, Internet use, tobacco/e-cigarettes, cannabis, and alcohol. Participants of the intervention group will receive individualised coaching by a conversational agent (chatbot) for a period of four months. The coaching relies on motivational and social-cognitive principles of behaviour change. Within weekly dialogues, the coach provides individually tailored information in different formats, such as videoclips, texts, or pictures. Study participants will be 1318 apprentices with a minimum age of 15, recruited in approximately 100 vocational school classes in Switzerland. Primary outcome will be a composite measure for addictive behaviours including (1) at risk-drinking, (2) tobacco/e-cigarette smoking, (3) cannabis use, and (4) problematic Internet use. Discussion: The study will reveal whether this universally implementable but individually tailored intervention approach is effective in preventing the onset and escalation of addictive behaviors among apprentices.

Using Inspiration Cards for Designing Persuasive Technology to Improve Creative Situations,"Jalowski, M.","Persuasive technology is an established field of research that is applied in various domains. However, creative situations, collaborative, or knowledge-intensive processes are still underrepresented. Numerous established approaches exist for the design of persuasive technology. For this purpose, first applications for inspiration cards are already described in the literature. These serve as a source of inspiration in workshops and facilitate the communication between participants and designers. In this study, inspiration cards were used to facilitate the design of persuasive technology to improve creative situations. Applying a design science research approach, this study developed inspiration cards and a canvas. This artifact consists of 17 technology cards, 49 application cards, nine potentials cards and a canvas to structure the design process. The artifact was evaluated in a workshop in which a persuasive technology to support creative behavior in a creative situation was developed by the participants. The results advance the concept of inspiration cards for the design of persuasive technology, provides tools to better analyze a specific application context, that is, a creative situation, and may help promote the use of persuasive technology in an underrepresented field. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12684 LNCS,,231-244,,10.1007/978-3-030-79460-6_19,,#5761,Jalowski 2021,,,0

"Dashboard stories: How narratives told by predictive analytics reconfigure roles, risk and sociality in education","Jarke, J.; Macgilchrist, F.","In this paper, we explore how the development and affordances of predictive analytics may impact how teachers and other educational actors think about and teach students and, more broadly, how society understands education. Our particular focus is on the data dashboards of learning support systems which are based on Machine Learning (ML). While previous research has focused on how these systems produce credible knowledge, we explore here how they also produce compelling, persuasive and convincing narratives. Our main argument is that particular kinds of stories are written by predictive analytics and written into their data dashboards. Based on a case study of a leading predictive analytics system, we explore how data dashboards imply causality between the ‘facts’ they are visualising. To do so, we analyse the stories they tell according to their spatial and temporal dimensions, characters and events, sequentiality as well as tellability. In the stories we identify, teachers are managers, students are at greater or lesser risk, and students’ sociality is reduced to machine-readable interactions. Overall, only data marked as individual behaviours becomes relevant to the system, rendering structural inequalities invisible. Reflecting on the implications of these systems, we suggest ways in which the uptake of these systems can interrupt such stories and reshape them in other directions. © The Author(s) 2021.",2021,,Big Data and Society,8,1,,,10.1177/20539517211025561,,#5764,Jarke 2021,,,0
Beware the evolving 'intelligent' web service! an integration architecture tactic to guard AI-first components,"Cummaudo, A.; Barnett, S.; Vasa, R.; Grundy, J.; Abdelrazek, M.","Intelligent services provide the power of AI to developers via simple RESTful API endpoints, abstracting away many complexities of machine learning. However, most of these intelligent services - -such as computer vision - -continually learn with time. When the internals within the abstracted 'black box' become hidden and evolve, pitfalls emerge in the robustness of applications that depend on these evolving services. Without adapting the way developers plan and construct projects reliant on intelligent services, significant gaps and risks result in both project planning and development. Therefore, how can software engineers best mitigate software evolution risk moving forward, thereby ensuring that their own applications maintain quality? Our proposal is an architectural tactic designed to improve intelligent service-dependent software robustness. The tactic involves creating an application-specific benchmark dataset baselined against an intelligent service, enabling evolutionary behaviour changes to be mitigated. A technical evaluation of our implementation of this architecture demonstrates how the tactic can identify 1,054 cases of substantial confidence evolution and 2,461 cases of substantial changes to response label sets using a dataset consisting of 331 images that evolve when sent to a service. © 2020 ACM.",2020,,ESEC/FSE 2020 - Proceedings of the 28th ACM Joint Meeting European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering,,,269-280,,10.1145/3368089.3409688,,#5765,Cummaudo 2020,,,0

Bayesian Persuasion under Ex Ante and Ex Post Constraints,"Babichenko, Y.; Talgam-Cohen, I.; Zabarnyi, K.","Bayesian persuasion, as introduced by Kamenica and Gentzkow in 2011, is the study of information sharing policies among strategic agents. A prime example is signaling in online ad auctions: what information should a platform signal to an advertiser regarding a user when selling the opportunity to advertise to her? Practical considerations such as preventing discrimination, protecting privacy or acknowledging limited attention of the information receiver impose constraints on information sharing. We propose a simple way to mathematically model such constraints as restrictions on Receiver’s admissible posterior beliefs. We consider two families of constraints – ex ante and ex post; the latter limits each instance of Sender-Receiver communication, while the former more general family can also pose restrictions in expectation. For the ex ante family, a result of Doval and Skreta (2018) establishes the existence of an optimal signaling scheme with a small number of signals – at most the number of constraints plus the number of states of nature – and we show this result is tight. For the ex post family, we tighten the previous bound of Vølund (2018), showing that the required number of signals is at most the number of states of nature, as in the original Kamenica-Gentzkow setting. As our main algorithmic result, we provide an additive bi-criteria FPTAS for an optimal constrained signaling scheme assuming a constant number of states of nature; we improve the approximation to single-criteria under a Slater-like regularity condition. The FPTAS holds under standard assumptions, and more relaxed assumptions yield a PTAS. We then establish a bound on the ratio between Sender’s optimal utility under convex ex ante constraints and the corresponding ex post constraints. We demonstrate how this result can be applied to find an approximately welfare-maximizing constrained signaling scheme in ad auctions.

Termination for Cultural Misalignment: Setting up Contract Terms to Ensure Community Well-Being in the Development of AI,"Ruster, L.P.; Brown, G.","A contractual mechanism to protect and amplify the interests of Indigenous community well-being in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that affects them is investigated. Our proposal explores the need for a legal mechanism that recognizes the importance of cultural knowledge and ways of being and doing, acknowledging that these can be in tension with the (potentially myopic) goals of AI development. We outline the pre-conditions for such a legal mechanism to be possible, including some of the core components that could give rise to a termination for cultural misalignment, as well as the supporting types of governance structures and operating principles such a legal mechanism may engender. We discuss how the establishment of such a mechanism in contracts forces procurers of AI technology development services, and therefore developers of AI technology systems themselves, to adopt and enact principles by which they will work to protect and enable community well-being, thereby instigating important behavior change. Consideration is given to the types of knowledge, skills and training that would be required to implement such a mechanism successfully.

Innovations to improve access to musculoskeletal care,"Chehade, M.J.; Yadav, L.; Kopansky-Giles, D.; Merolli, M.; Palmer, E.; Jayatilaka, A.; Slater, H.","Innovation is a form of realising a new way of doing something, often ignoring traditional wisdom, in order to meet new challenges. Globally, particularly in emerging economies, the high burden of musculoskeletal conditions and their contribution to multimorbidity continue to rise, as does the gap for services to deliver essential care. There is a growing need to find solutions to this challenge and deliver person-centred and integrated care, wherein empowering patients with the capacity for self-management is critical. Whilst there is an abundance of information available online to support consumer education, the number of sources for credible medical information is diluted by uninformed anecdotal social media solutions. Even with the provision of high-quality information, behavioural change does not necessarily follow, and more robust educational approaches are required. In this chapter, we examine innovation, its management and the strategic directions required to improve musculoskeletal healthcare at macro (policy), meso (service delivery) and micro (clinical practice) levels. We discuss the critical role of consumer agency (patients and their families/carers) in driving innovation and the need to leverage this through empowerment by education. We provide a snapshot of real-world examples of innovative practices including capacity building in consumer and interprofessional musculoskeletal education and practice; recommendations to transform the access and delivery of integrated, person-centred care; and initiatives in musculoskeletal care and implementation of models of care, enabled by digital health solutions including telehealth, remote monitoring, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and big data. We provide emerging evidence for how innovation can support systems' strengthening and build capacity to support improved access to ‘right’ musculoskeletal care, and explore some of the ways to best manage innovations. We conclude with recommended systematic steps to establish required leadership, collaboration, research, networking, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of future innovations in musculoskeletal health and care. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Best Practice and Research: Clinical Rheumatology,34,5,,,10.1016/j.berh.2020.101559,,#5777,Chehade 2020,,,0

"Psychological Processes and Advertising Effects: Theory, Research, and Applications","Alwitt, L.F.; Mitchell, A.A.","In the 1980s our understanding of how advertising affects consumer behavior was undergoing a dramatic transformation. Recent theoretical and methodological advances in cognitive psychology, social cognition, and artificial intelligence were largely responsible for this transformation. These advances provided a better understanding of the information acquisition process and how information is stored in memory. Consequently, we have been able to incorporate memory, the processing of visual information and affect into our models of advertising effects. However, there were still many unanswered questions. Among these are: (1) Exactly what is the relationship between the different mediators of persuasion? (2) How is memory for advertising related to persuasion? (3) What are the theoretical underpinnings of attitude toward the advertisement? (4) What determines the effect of persuasion over time? (5) What factors affect attention to advertising? (6) What psychological processes occur during the watching of a television commercial? and (7) What factors affect individual differences in the processing of advertising messages?

Calculating the strength of rhetorical arguments in persuasive negotiation dialogues,"Morveli-Espinoza, M.","Rhetorical arguments are used in negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to persuade his opponent to accept a proposal more readily. When more than one argument is generated, the proponent must compare them in order to select the most adequate for his interests. A way of comparing them is by means of their strength values. Related work propose a calculation based only on the components of the rhetorical arguments, i.e., the importance of the opponent’s goal and the certainty level of the beliefs that make up the argument. This work aims to propose a model for the calculation of the strength of rhetorical arguments, which is inspired on the pre-conditions of credibility and preferability stated by Guerini and Castelfranchi. Thus, we suggest the use of two new criteria to the strength calculation: the credibility of the proponent and the status of the opponent’s goal in the goal processing cycle.

Eliciting Personal Attitude Changes on Friendship Based on a Multilinear Narrative,"Keller, T.; Brucker, E.; Seiler, T.; Läubli, L.","Affective Computing refers to a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims to recognize, interpret, and adequately respond to human emotions. Human-machine interactions should thus become more individual and emotionally appealing. But what would our everyday life look like if such an emotionally intelligent artificial being became our best friend? This question was addressed by a multilinear development scenario that lets the reader experience different stages in the life of the protagonist from the first day in secondary school to the loss of a loved one in midlife. The subject of this sci-fi prototyping was the progressive power of emotional artificial intelligence, which becomes tangible in this multilinear story in four fictional stages in the future. In each stage, the reader is presented with a decision that affects the role of the artificially intelligent being in the protagonist's life. In this way, different versions of our digital future can be experienced with affective computing. © 2021 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2021.

Artificial intelligence chatbot behavior change model for designing artificial intelligence chatbots to promote physical activity and a healthy diet: Viewpoint,"Zhang, J.; Oh, Y.J.; Lange, P.; Yu, Z.; Fukuoka, Y.","Background: Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. Methods: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles. ©Jingwen Zhang, Yoo Jung Oh, Patrick Lange, Zhou Yu, Yoshimi Fukuoka.

An Innovative Approach to Predict early Stage Depression using Mobile Network Usage,"Dwivedi, Y.S.; Semalty, G.; Moondra, A.","This article introduces an early-stage depression identification technique without a physical presence in the medical unit. Currently used methods do not provide any early-stage depression detection techniques and require continuous investigation to diagnose depression. In general, depression detection is based on changes in human behavior. Changes in human behavior are also reflected in his/her mobile usage pattern. Mobile usage can correlate with human behavior and predict early-stage depression based on artificial intelligence (AI). The mobile usage data collected (e.g. location, activity, phone usage) can be used for effective depression screening. The proposed approach suggests using the user's mobile usage pattern and applying machine learning algorithms to identify the change in mobile usage patterns over time. The machine learning algorithm like Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) can be effectively used to identify the change in pattern. This change in mobile usage pattern is then used to detect if the user is slowly moving into depression and warn the individual or concerned authority to handle the case.  © 2021 IEEE.",2021,,"Proceedings - 2021 3rd International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication Control and Networking, ICAC3N 2021",,,1224-1227,,10.1109/ICAC3N53548.2021.9725669,,#5790,Dwivedi 2021,,,0
Under the (Plastic) Sea - Sensitizing People Toward Ecological Behavior Using Virtual Reality Controlled by Users' Physical Activity,"Straßmann, C.; Arntz, A.; Eimler, S.C.","As environmental pollution continues to expand, new ways for raising awareness for the consequences need to be explored. Virtual reality has emerged as an effective tool for behavioral change. This paper investigates if virtual reality applications controlled through physical activity can support an even stronger effect, because it enhances the attention and recall performance by stimulating the working memory through motor functions. This was tested in an experimental study using a virtual reality head-mounted display in combination with the ICAROS fitness device enabling participants to explore either a plastic-polluted or non-polluted sea. Results indicated that using a regular controller elicits more presence and a more intense Flow experience than the ICAROS condition, which people controlled via their physical activity. Moreover, the plastic-polluted stimulus was more effective in inducing attitude change than a nonpolluted sea.  © 2020 IEEE.",2020,,"Proceedings - 2020 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Virtual Reality, AIVR 2020",,,166-173,,10.1109/AIVR50618.2020.00036,,#5791,Straßmann 2020,,,0
Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Science Through the Looking Glass: Challenges for Real-World Application,"Mac Aonghusa, P.; Michie, S.","Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the process of scientific research. AI, coupled with availability of large datasets and increasing computational power, is accelerating progress in areas such as genetics, climate change and astronomy [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada; Hausen R, Robertson BE. Morpheus: A deep learning framework for the pixel-level analysis of astronomical image data. Astrophys J Suppl Ser. 2020;248:20; Dias R, Torkamani A. AI in clinical and genomic diagnostics. Genome Med. 2019;11:70.]. The application of AI in behavioral science is still in its infancy and realizing the promise of AI requires adapting current practices. Purposes: By using AI to synthesize and interpret behavior change intervention evaluation report findings at a scale beyond human capability, the HBCP seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities. We explore challenges facing AI adoption in behavioral science through the lens of lessons learned during the Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP). Methods: The project used an iterative cycle of development and testing of AI algorithms. Using a corpus of published research reports of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions, behavioral science experts annotated occurrences of interventions and outcomes. AI algorithms were trained to recognize natural language patterns associated with interventions and outcomes from the expert human annotations. Once trained, the AI algorithms were used to predict outcomes for interventions that were checked by behavioral scientists. Results: Intervention reports contain many items of information needing to be extracted and these are expressed in hugely variable and idiosyncratic language used in research reports to convey information makes developing algorithms to extract all the information with near perfect accuracy impractical. However, statistical matching algorithms combined with advanced machine learning approaches created reasonably accurate outcome predictions from incomplete data. Conclusions: AI holds promise for achieving the goal of predicting outcomes of behavior change interventions, based on information that is automatically extracted from intervention evaluation reports. This information can be used to train knowledge systems using machine learning and reasoning algorithms.  © 2021 The Author(s).

Are User Manuals Obsolete with Persuasive Systems?,"Agyei, E.E.Y.F.; Oinas-Kukkonen, H.","Ensuring that users can successfully perform their primary tasks and achieve their behavioral goals is critical for the success of persuasive system. Are user manuals needed to achieve this goal? In this paper, we sought to understand the role of end-user documentation for persuasive systems. 50 persuasive apps from the Google Play Store were analysed to determine the importance of user manuals or guides for persuasive health apps. Although based on a small data set, our results show that in most cases persuasive systems need user documentation and hence we encourage developers of such systems to allocate resources for creating quality documentation for their users. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12684 LNCS,,320-327,,10.1007/978-3-030-79460-6_25,,#5793,Agyei 2021,,,0
"“What’s Important to You, Max?”: The Influence of Goals on Engagement in an Interactive Narrative for Adolescent Health Behavior Change","Mott, M.; Mott, B.; Rowe, J.; Ozer, E.; Giovanelli, A.; Berna, M.; Pugatch, M.; Tebb, K.; Penilla, C.; Lester, J.","Interactive narrative technologies for preventive health care offer significant potential for promoting health behavior change in adolescents. By improving adolescents’ knowledge, personal efficacy, and self-regulatory skills these technologies hold great promise for realizing positive impacts on adolescent health. These potential benefits are enabled through story-centric learning experiences that provide opportunities for adolescents to practice strategies to reduce risky health behaviors in engaging game-based environments. A distinctive feature of interactive narrative that promotes engagement is players’ ability to influence the story through the choices they make. In this paper, we present initial work investigating engagement in an interactive narrative that focuses on reducing adolescents’ risky behaviors around alcohol use. Specifically, we consider how the short-term and long-term goals adolescents choose as being important to the protagonist character relates to their engagement with the interactive narrative. Leveraging interaction log data from a pilot study with 20 adolescents, we conduct a cluster-based analysis of the goals players selected. We then examine how engagement differs between the identified clusters. Results indicate that adolescents’ choices for the protagonist’s short-term and long-term goals can significantly impact their engagement with the interactive narrative. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13138 LNCS,,379-392,,10.1007/978-3-030-92300-6_37,,#5794,Mott 2021,,,0
Applying Animated Parables to Gamification in Daily Context: An Expert Evaluation Study,"Chow, K.K.N.","Latest studies regarding gamification for behavior change have suggested using meaningful stories for long-term effects. Drawing on psychological studies related to narrative transportation and mental simulation, this paper extends the idea of animated parables and argues that selecting stories to frame gamified systems should consider perceived causality between the real-life action and the simulated diegetic effect. This study employs expert evaluation on a collection of parables regarding perceived usefulness, novelty, and perceived causality. Results show that parables consensually rated by experts as both useful and novel are also prominent in perceived causality, which supports the argument that perceived causality underpins perceived persuasiveness of parables. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2021,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),13138 LNCS,,322-332,,10.1007/978-3-030-92300-6_31,,#5796,Chow 2021,,,0
HARGAN: Heterogeneous Argument Attention Network for Persuasiveness Prediction,"Huang, K.-Y.; Huang, H.-H.; Chen, H.-H.","Argument structure elaborates the relation among claims and premises. Previous works in persuasiveness prediction seldom consider this relation in their architectures. To take argument structure information into account, this paper proposes an approach to persuasiveness prediction with a novel graphbased neural network model, called heterogeneous argument attention network (HARGAN). By jointly training on the persuasiveness and stance of the replies, our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ChangeMyView (CMV) dataset for the persuasiveness prediction task. Experimental results show that the graph setting enables our model to aggregate information across multiple paragraphs effectively. In the meanwhile, our stance prediction auxiliary task enables our model to identify the viewpoint of each party, and helps our model perform better on the persuasiveness prediction. & copy; 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

A Virtual Conversational Agent for Teens with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Experimental Results and Design Lessons,"Ali, M.R.; Razavi, S.Z.; Langevin, R.; Al Mamun, A.; Kane, B.; Rawassizadeh, R.; Schubert, L.K.; Hoque, E.","We present the design of an online social skills development interface for teenagers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The interface is intended to enable private conversation practice anywhere, anytime using a web-browser. Users converse informally with a virtual agent, receiving feedback on nonverbal cues in realtime, and summary feedback. The prototype was developed in consultation with an expert UX designer, two psychologists, and a pediatrician. Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility. © 2020 ACM.",2020,,"Proceedings of the 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents, IVA 2020",,,,,10.1145/3383652.3423900,,#5798,Ali 2020,,,0
Effects of personalization and social role in voice shopping: An experimental study on product recommendation by a conversational voice agent,"Rhee, C.E.; Choi, J.","This study examines the persuasion mechanism in product recommendations made by a voice-based conversational agent and explores whether the personalized content reflecting the customer's preferences and the agent's social role of a friend, rather than a secretary, generate a more positive attitude toward the product in the context of voice shopping. With the framework of dual modes of information-processing models, we hypothesized that the personalization of messages would be a central route with a greater impact on attitude for products with high involvement. By contrast, the social role of the conversational agent was expected to represent a peripheral route with a greater impact on products with low involvement. An experimental study was designed to test the effects of personalized content that reflected individual preferences for product attributes and a friend role of a voice agent with high and low product involvement. The results showed main effects of both personalization and the social role on building attitudes toward the product. Although no interaction effect for personalization and involvement was found, there was a significant interaction effect for the social role and involvement. This study contributes to persuasion theory by extending it to the interaction with a conversational agent. For practitioners, the study provides insights into the importance of the personalized content of recommendations and the need for consideration of an alternative social role in the design of voice shopping through a conversational agent. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Computers in Human Behavior,109,,,,10.1016/j.chb.2020.106359,,#5799,Rhee 2020,,,0

The debate, between two 2-person teams with a moderator, was organized by the ICVR Program committee to address the question “Will virtual rehabilitation replace clinicians?” It brought together five academics with technical, research, and/or clinical backgrounds—Gerry Fluet, Tal Krasovsky, Anat Lubetzky, Philippe Archambault, W. Geoffrey Wright—to debate the pros and cons of using virtual reality (VR) and related technologies to help assess, diagnose, treat, and track recovery, and more specifically investigate the likelihood that advanced technology will ultimately replace human clinicians. Both teams were assigned a side to defend, whether it represented their own viewpoint or not, and to take whatever positions necessary to make a persuasive argument and win the debate. In this paper we present a recapitulation of the arguments presented by both sides, and further include an in-depth consideration of the question. We attempt to judiciously lay out a number of arguments that fall along a spectrum from moderate to extreme; the most extreme and/or indefensible positions are presented for rhetorical and demonstrative purposes.

A persuasive chatbot using a crowd-sourced argument graph and concerns,"Chalaguine, L.A.; Hunter, A.","Chatbots are versatile tools that have the potential of being used for computational persuasion where the chatbot acts as the persuader and the human agent as the persuadee. To allow the user to type his or her arguments, as opposed to selecting them from a menu, the chatbot needs a sufficiently large knowledge base of arguments and counterarguments. And in order to make the user change their current stance on a subject, the chatbot needs a method to select persuasive counterarguments.

Power optimization control scheme for doubly fed induction generator used in wind turbine generators,"Khan, D.; Ansari, J.A.; Khan, S.A.; Abrar, U.","Scientists and researchers are exploring different methods of generating and delivering electrical energy in an economical and reliable way, enabling them to generate electricity focusing on renewable energy resources. All of these possess the natural property of self-changing behavior, so the connection of these separate independent controllable units to the grid leads to uncertainties. This creates an imbalance in active power and reactive power. In order to control the active and reactive power in wind turbine generators with adjustable speed, various control strategies are used to allay voltage and current variations. This research work is focused on the design and implementation of effective control strategies for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to control its active and reactive power. A DFIG system with its control strategies is simulated on MATLAB software. To augment the transient stability of DFIG, the simulation results for the active and reactive power of conventional controllers are compared with three types of feed forward neural network controllers, i.e., probabilistic feedforward neural network (PFFNN), multi-layer perceptron feedforward neural network (MLPFFN) and radial basic function feedforward neural network (RBFFN) for optimum performance. Conclusive outcomes clearly manifest the superior robustness of the RBFNN controller over other controllers in terms of rise time, settling time and overshoot value. © 2020 by the authors.

Why travelers trust and accept self-driving cars: An empirical study,"Du, H.; Zhu, G.; Zheng, J.","Automated vehicle technology is becoming increasingly mature with the development of Artificial Intelligence and information communications technology. It is important to understand the factors affecting the use of automated vehicles. This study investigates user acceptance and the willingness to use fully driverless cars (self-driving cars). Based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we developed a new acceptance model to explore the impact of mass media on adopting self-driving cars. A survey was designed and distributed, and 173 responded. The results show that 84.4% of the respondents are willing to accept driverless cars. At this early stage, the reports from mass media significantly influence people's perception of self-driving cars. The media affect self-efficacy and subjective norms, and thereby people's trust and behavior change. Moreover, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and trust significantly influence their intention to use self-driving cars.

Robonomics in the 6G Era: Playing the Trust Game with On-Chaining Oracles and Persuasive Robots,"Beniiche, A.; Rostami, S.; Maier, M.","6G is anticipated to become more human-centered than 5G and should not only explore more spectrum at high-frequency bands but, more importantly, converge driving technological trends such as blockchain technologies and connected robotics. This paper focuses on the emerging field of robonomics, which studies the sociotechnical impact of blockchain technologies on social human-robot interaction and behavioral economics for the social integration of robots into human society. Advanced blockchain technologies such as oracles enable the on-chaining of blockchain-external off-chain information stemming from human users. In doing so, they leverage on human intelligence rather than machine learning only. In this paper, we investigate the widely studied trust game of behavioral economics in a blockchain context, paying close attention to the importance of developing efficient cooperation and coordination technologies. After identifying open research challenges of blockchain-enabled implementations of the trust game, we first develop a smart contract that replaces the experimenter in the middle between trustor and trustee and demonstrate experimentally that a social efficiency of up to 100% can be achieved by using deposits to enhance both trust and trustworthiness. We then present an on-chaining oracle architecture for a networked $N$ -player trust game that involves a third type of human agents called observers, who track the players' investment and reciprocity. The presence of third-party reward and penalty decisions helps raise the average normalized reciprocity above 80%, even without requiring any deposit. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that mixed logical-affective persuasive strategies for social robots improve the trustees' trustworthiness and reciprocity significantly.  © 2013 IEEE.",2021,,IEEE Access,9,,46949-46959,,10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3068239,,#5813,Beniiche 2021,,,0
Problems that Can Occur when Assaying Extracts to Pure Compounds in Biological Systems,"Newman, D.J.","For a significant number of years, scientists of many persuasions have assayed natural product materials ranging from crude extracts to pure compounds, in a multitude of assays causally related to some biological processes. However, in a very significant number of submitted papers and published articles, what may be considered as canned biological assays were used, and if a positive effect was observed, then the authors would claim that the material assayed was a potential drug lead. This also occurred with pure synthetic compounds and compounds derived from natural products by simple chemical modifications. However, what has now become quite obvious—with all such classes of materials—is that there are many promiscuous players with multiple bioactivities. These can range from relatively crude extracts, pure compounds from natural products, synthetic processes that produce natural product derivatives, and even compounds that are truly synthetic in origin. There is also a potential problem with the data from crude to purified extracts being used to claim some form of beneficial activities for such materials, to sell that particular mixture to the lay public, by very careful descriptions of its possible uses due to legal hurdles. With the advent of artificial intelligence and very large compound databases, some of which may well contain impure materials, scientists from a variety of backgrounds have begun to utilize such listings to obtain compounds for their low to high throughput biological screens, without realizing that there are very significant numbers of active compounds (eg, pan assay interference compounds and invalid metabolic panaceas), that will hit in many different screens for a variety of reasons, thus leading to significant wasted efforts and published scientific articles that have incorrect results. This commentary gives some of the history of such materials but is designed to be used as a warning to both researchers and in particular, journal editors, and reviewers, that reports of biological results that are claimed to be the result of the compounds used, need to be very carefully screened for results due to such promiscuous compounds, irrespective of their nominal source(s). All literature searches were made by the author and the background knowledge has come from more than 55 years of research in industry and governmental laboratories in both the United Kingdom and the United States, for enzyme inhibitors/activators as well as antimicrobial and antitumor lead compounds mainly from natural product sources.

An integrated architecture for intelligence evaluation of automated vehicles,"Huang, H.; Zheng, X.; Yang, Y.; Liu, J.; Liu, W.; Wang, J.","Increasing automation calls for evaluating the effectiveness and intelligence of automated vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating the intelligence of automated vehicles. Firstly, we establish the evaluation environment for automated vehicles including test field, test task, and evaluation index. The test tasks include the single vehicle decision-making (turning, lane-changing, overtaking, etc.) and the maneuver execution of multi-vehicle interaction (obstacle avoidance, trajectory optimization, etc.). The intelligence evaluation index is the action amount of driving process considering the safety, efficiency, rationality and comfort. Then, we calculate the actual action amount of the automated vehicle in different scenarios in the test field. Finally, the least action calculated theoretically corresponds to the highest intelligence degree of the automated vehicle, and is employed as a standard to quantify the performance of other tested automated vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework is verified with two naturalistic driving datasets that contain the normal driving scenarios and high-risk scenarios. Specifically, the naturalistic lane-changing data filters 40,416 frames and 179 similar lane-changing trajectories. Compared with the lane-changing behavior of a large number of drivers, experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intelligence degree of drivers in the lane change scenario. Meanwhile, in 253 reconstructed high-risk scenarios, the intelligent risk avoidance ability of the proposed intelligence degree evaluation algorithm can be verified by comparing with the driver behavior and TTC algorithm. These experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles under various scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",2020,,Accident Analysis and Prevention,145,,,,10.1016/j.aap.2020.105681,,#5816,Huang 2020,,,0
Improving Energy Efficiency in Tertiary Buildings Through User-Driven Recommendations Delivered on Optimal Micro-moments,"Tsolakis, A.C.; Tsakirakis, G.; Vasilopoulos, V.G.; Peppas, K.; Zafeiris, C.; Makaratzis, I.; Grimaldo, A.; Krinidis, S.; Novak, J.; Bravos, G.; Tzovaras, D.","Sustainable energy is hands down one of the biggest challenges of our times. As the EU sets its focus to reach its 2030 and 2050 goals, the importance of energy efficiency for energy consumers/prosumers becomes prevalent. Over the years, a lot of different approaches have been followed to engage end-users and affect energy-related occupant behaviour towards improving energy efficiency results and long term behaviour changes. This work presents the SIT4Energy user-centered approach for tertiary buildings that delivers an end-to-end solution that takes into consideration a set of tools and models for successfully engaging and affecting the end-user’s energy-related behaviour. Starting from appropriate user profiling models for energy-related behaviour models and an explainable recommendation engine, to on the fly human activity tracking and micro-moments detection on mobile devices, a set of recommendations are delivered to the end-users through a mobile device, presenting valuable information with user-tailored context and on the optimal timing. The overall solution is clearly documented, whereas real-life results are presented from the deployment in offices in a university building. From the evaluation performed it is clearly depicted that a positive impact has been achieved both in terms of energy efficiency as well as energy-related behaviour. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",2021,,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,628,,352-363,,10.1007/978-3-030-79157-5_29,,#5817,Tsolakis 2021,,,0
"It is only for your own good, or is it? Ethical considerations for designing ethically conscious persuasive information systems","Benner, D.; Schöbel, S.; Janson, A.","Persuasive designs, including gamification and digital nudging, have become well renowned during the last years and have been implemented successfully across different sectors including education, e-health, e-governance, e-finance and general information systems. In this regard, persuasive design can support desirable changes in attitude and behavior of users in order to achieve their own goals. However, such persuasive influence on individuals raises ethical questions as persuasive designs can impair the autonomy of users or persuade the user towards goals of a third party and hence lead to unethical decision-making processes. In human-computer interaction this is especially significant with the advent of advanced artificial intelligence that can emulate human behavior and thus bring new dynamics into play. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature analysis with the goal to compile an overview of ethical considerations for persuasive system design, derive potential guidelines for ethical persuasive designs and shed light on potential research gaps. © AMCIS 2021.",2021,,"27th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2021",,,,,,,#5818,Benner 2021,,,0
Image Inpainting and Classification Agent Training Based on Reinforcement Learning and Generative Models with Attention Mechanism,"Ukwuoma, C.C.; Belal Bin Heyat, M.; Masadeh, M.; Akhtar, F.; Zhiguang, Q.; Bondzie-Selby, E.; Alshorman, O.; Alkahtani, F.","What distinguishes the field of artificial intelligence (AI) from others is to develop fully independent agents that learn optimal behavior, change, and evolve solely through the communication of trial and error with the surrounding environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) can be seen in multiple aspects of Machine Learning (ML), provided the environment, reward, actions, the state will be defined. Agent training in previous years is seen to only relate to robotics, games, and self-driving cars. While trying to divert the focus of researchers from the view of self-driving cars, games, robots, etc. Here, we investigated using reinforcement learning in the aspect of task completion. We deployed our architecture in an inpainting task where the agent generates the distorted or missing image content into an eminent fidelity completed the image by using reinforcement learning to influence the generative model utilized. The Generative Adversary Network (GAN) problem of not being steady and challenging to train was overwhelmed by utilizing latent space representation. The dimension is reduced compared to the distorted or corrupted image in training the GAN. Then reinforcement learning was deployed to pick the correct GAN input to get the image's latent space representation that is most suitable for the current input of the missing or distorted image region. In this paper, we also learned that the trained agent enhances the accuracy in a classification task of images with missing data. We successfully examined the classification enhancement on images missing 30%, 50%, and 70%.  © 2021 IEEE.",2021,,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Microelectronics, ICM",,,96-101,,10.1109/ICM52667.2021.9664950,,#5819,Ukwuoma 2021,,,0

Evaluation of In-Person Counseling Strategies to Develop Physical Activity Chatbot for Women,"Liang, K.-H.; Lange, P.; Oh, Y.J.; Zhang, J.; Fukuoka, Y.; Yu, Z.","Artificial intelligence chatbots are the vanguard in technology-based intervention to change people's behavior. To develop intervention chatbots, the first step is to understand natural language conversation strategies in human conversation.

We designed comprehensive annotation schemes in four dimensions (domain, strategy, social exchange, and taskfocused exchange) and annotated a subset of dialogs. We built a strategy classifier with context information to detect strategies from both trainers and participants based on the annotation. To understand how human intervention induces effective behavior changes, we analyzed the relationships between the intervention strategies and the participants' changes in the barrier and social support for physical activity.

Making Them Use It: User Perceptions that Determine the Acceptance of a Persuasive Interventions for Child Healthcare,"Langrial, S.; Ham, J.; Al Araimi, F.A.F.","Persuasive Technologies can cause behavior change for improving child health care. However, for persuasive technology to be effective, users have to accept it. We propose a model of determinants of users’ acceptance of persuasive technologies that contains five constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), which were used as latent variables determining users’ acceptance to use a persuasive intervention for child healthcare. A structured questionnaire was validated and completed by 133 participants to assess their perceptions. Results indicate that Perceived Usefulness, Content of Intervention and Perceived Credibility can have a significant influence on Intention to Use the Intervention.

"Aristotelian Dialectic, Argumentation Theory and Artificial Intelligence","Walton, D.","It is shown that Aristotelian dialectic can be analyzed as having two parts: a core formal model that has a formal dialogue structure and a set of ten definable supplementary characteristics that lie outside the core structure. Some current argumentation tools used in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems are applied to the task of extending the core formal model to include the supplementary characteristics. Using these tools it is explained how the structure of a dialogue can be mapped into an argument diagram that can be analyzed and evaluated using standard argumentation techniques such as argumentation schemes, types of dialogue, critical questions and a dialectical concept of burden of proof.

Early Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in an At-Home Setting,"Sabbagh, M.N.; Boada, M.; Borson, S.; Doraiswamy, P.M.; Dubois, B.; Ingram, J.; Iwata, A.; Porsteinsson, A.P.; Possin, K.L.; Rabinovici, G.D.; Vellas, B.; Chao, S.; Vergallo, A.; Hampel, H.","Emerging digital tools have the potential to enable a new generation of qualitative and quantitative assessment of cognitive performance. Moreover, the ubiquity of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and tablets, can be harnessed to support large-scale self-assessed cognitive screening with benefit to healthcare systems and consumers. A wide variety of apps, wearables, and new digital technologies are either available or in development for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for dementia. Two categories of novel methodologies may be considered: passive technologies (which monitor a user’ behavior without active user input) and interactive assessments (which require active user input). Such examinations can be self-administered, supervised by a caregiver, or conducted by an informant at home or outside of a clinical setting. These direct-to-consumer tools have the potential to sidestep barriers associated with cognitive evaluation in primary care, thus improving access to cognitive assessments. Although direct-to-consumer cognitive assessment is associated with its own barriers, including test validation, user experience, and technological concerns, it is conceivable that these issues can be addressed so that a large-scale, selfassessed cognitive evaluation that would represent an initial cognitive screen may be feasible in the future. © 2020, The Author(s).",2020,,Journal of Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease,7,3,171-178,,10.14283/jpad.2020.22,,#5831,Sabbagh 2020,,,0
Self-Explanatory Capabilities in Intelligent Decision Support Systems in Resource Management,"Rumsamrong, M.; Chiou, A.; Li, L.","Self-explanations in decision support systems need to be presented in parallel with considering and understanding the outcomes of advice from the expert system. This advice can realise benefits such as increased user acceptance and confidence in the adoption of the improved system. There are numerous categories of explanation, including the following. In order for an expert system to reach a conclusion, there needs to be: (1) justification and a record of the inferential steps; (2) an explicit knowledge of the underlying argument, or (3) explanation of the rationale behind each inferential measure taken by the expert system. This recommendation will result in more persuasive justification and lead to satisfaction, and acceptance of advice. For this reason, it is proposed to announce a discourse semantics approach to an Intelligent Decision Support System framework by the inclusion of a discourse layer. In this paper, the discourse semantics layer approach will be demonstrated to show the mechanism of how a fuzzy logic based expert system utilises justification techniques for advice offered in the problem of control and resource management. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,993,,356-367,,10.1007/978-3-030-22354-0_32,,#5833,Rumsamrong 2020,,,0
"Measuring the strength of threats, rewards, and appeals in persuasive negotiation dialogues","Morveli-Espinoza, M.; Nieves, J.C.; Tacla, C.A.","The aim of this article is to propose a model for the measurement of the strength of rhetorical arguments (i.e., threats, rewards, and appeals), which are used in persuasive negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to convince his opponent to accept a proposal. Related articles propose a calculation based on the components of the rhetorical arguments, that is, the importance of the goal of the opponent and the certainty level of the beliefs that make up the argument. Our proposed model is based on the pre-conditions of credibility and preferability stated by Guerini and Castelfranchi. Thus, we suggest the use of two new criteria for the strength calculation: the credibility of the proponent and the status of the goal of the opponent in the goal processing cycle. We use three scenarios in order to illustrate our proposal. Besides, the model is empirically evaluated and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is more efficient than previous works of the state of the art in terms of numbers of negotiation cycles, number of exchanged arguments, and number of reached agreements. © The Author(s), 2020.

Learning to Stop Smoking: Understanding Persuasive Applications’ Long-Term Behavior Change Effectiveness Through User Achievement Motivation,"Ham, J.; Langrial, S.U.","Compromising smoking cessation applications’ effectiveness, many users relapse. We propose that long-term adoption of persuasive technology is (partly) dependent on users’ motivational orientation. Therefore, we studied the potential relationship between user’s achievement motivation and the long-term behavior change effectiveness of persuasive technology. One-hundred users of a smoking cessation app filled out a questionnaire assessing their motivational orientation and (long-term) behavior change rates. Based on research findings, we expected that participants with stronger learning goal orientation (who are focused on self-improvement and persistent when facing failure) would report a higher long-term behavior change success rate. In contrast, we expected that participants with a stronger performance goal orientation (focused on winning, for whom solitary failures can undermine intrinsic motivation) would report lower long-term success. Results confirmed our hypotheses.

Aspects Influencing Food Intake and Approaches towards Personalising Nutrition in the Elderly,"Rusu, A.; Randriambelonoro, M.; Perrin, C.; Valk, C.; Álvarez, B.; Schwarze, A.-K.","Healthy diets have been demonstrated to complement benefits of physical activity, physical condition and mental wellbeing, all of them being important factors influencing the quality of life of elderly. Unfortunately malnutrition is a serious threat and an increasingly prevalent condition among the fast-growing elderly population. The present work addresses the identification of important factors contributing to decreased appetite and food intake as well as the development of approaches towards a healthy diet and personalised nutrition in elderly. Within the present study semi-structured interviews with elderly and elderly suffering from swallowing and mastication difficulties have been performed, results being used for the development of food provision modules and the corresponding recipes addressing the nutritional requirements of elderly. The social context and the swallowing and mastication difficulties influence the eating behaviour as well as the motivation to eat. On the other hand, it was found that texture modified foods (food which texture is adapted to the need of people with swallowing and mastication problems) could act as motivational aspect. With regard to food personalisation in the elderly the consideration of three different case scenarios based on individual independency and the degree of oral impairment seemed to be appropriate. Different aspects such as gender weight, physical activity level as well as high protein demand are important influential factors in the development of personalised recipes in elderly.

The Need for Artificial Intelligence in Digital Therapeutics,"Palanica, A.; Docktor, M.J.; Lieberman, M.; Fossat, Y.","Digital therapeutics is a newly described concept in healthcare which is proposed to change patient behavior and treat medical conditions using a variety of digital technologies. However, the term is rarely defined with criteria that make it distinct from simply digitizedversions of traditional therapeutics. Our objective is to describe a more valuable characteristic of digital therapeutics, which is distinct from traditional medicine or therapy: that is, the utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to monitor and predict individual patient symptom data in an adaptive clinical feedback loop via digital biomarkers to provide a precision medicine approach to healthcare. Artificial intelligence platforms can learn and predict effective interventions for individuals using a multitude of personal variables to provide a customized and more tailored therapy regimen. Digital therapeutics coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning also allows more effective clinical observations and management at the population level for various health conditions and cohorts. This vital differentiation of digital therapeutics compared to other forms of therapeutics enables a more personalized form of healthcare that actively adapts to patients' individual clinical needs, goals, and lifestyles. Importantly, these characteristics are what needs to be emphasized to patients, physicians, and policy makers to advance the entire field of digital healthcare. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

Agile Requirements Engineering and Software Planning for a Digital Health Platform to Engage the Effects of Isolation Caused by Social Distancing: Case Study,"Meinert, E.; Milne-Ives, M.; Surodina, S.; Lam, C.","Background: Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. Objective: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. Methods: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. Results: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. Conclusions: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness. © Edward Meinert.",2020,,JMIR Public Health and Surveillance,6,2,,,10.2196/19297,,#5843,Meinert 2020,,,0

Such digital systems assume various forms, from classic apps, to more advanced conversational agents or robots. Fifty-six articles describing a virtual coach for older adults and aimed at improving their wellbeing were identified and further analyzed. In particular, we presented how previous studies defined their virtual coaches, which behavioral change models and techniques they adopted and the overall system architecture, in terms of monitoring solutions, processing methods and modalities for intervention delivery. Our results show that few thorough evaluations of e-coaching systems have been conducted, especially regarding multi-domain coaching approaches. Through our analysis, we identified the wellbeing domains that should be addressed in future studies as well as the most promising behavior change models and techniques and coaching interfaces.

Design Features of Embodied Conversational Agents in eHealth: a Literature Review,"ter Stal, S.; Kramer, L.L.; Tabak, M.; op den Akker, H.; Hermens, H.","Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are gaining interest to elicit user engagement and stimulate actual use of eHealth applications. In this literature review, we identify the researched design features for ECAs in eHealth, the outcome variables that were used to measure the effect of these design features and what the found effects for each variable were. Searches were performed in Scopus, ACM Digital Library, PsychINFO, Pubmed and IEEE Xplore Digital Library, resulting in 1284 identified articles of which 33 articles were included. The agents speech and/or textual output and its facial and gaze expressions were the most common design features. Little research was performed on the agent's looks. The measured effect of these design features was often on the perception of the agent's and user's characteristics, relation with the agent, system usage, intention to use, usability and behaviour change. Results show that emotion and relational behaviour seem to positively affect the perception of the agents characteristics and that relational behaviour also seems to positively affect the relation with the agent, usability and intention to use. However, these design features do not necessarily lead to behaviour change. This review showed that consensus on design features of ECAs in eHealth is far from established. Follow-up research should include more research on the effects of all design features, especially research on the effects in a long-term, daily life setting, and replication of studies on the effects of design features performed in other contexts than eHealth. © 2020 The Authors",2020,,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,138,,,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2020.102409,,#5846,terStal 2020,,,0
Synergetic Combination of Interfacial Engineering and Shape-Changing Modulation for Biomimetic Soft Robotic Devices,"Yu, L.; Si, P.; Bauman, L.; Zhao, B.","Robotics is a frontal interdisciplinary subject across the fields of mechanical engineering, chemical and materials engineering, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology. Robotic devices with a variety of frameworks, functionalities, and actuation modes have been developed and employed in the manufacture of advanced materials and devices with improved efficiency and automation. In recent years, soft robots have attracted a significant amount of interest among scientific researchers and technological engineers because they can offer the desired safety, adaptability, sensibility, and dexterity that conventional robotics cannot deliver. To date, emulating living creatures in nature has been a promising approach to design soft robots. For living creatures, both body deformation and their surface characteristic are essential for them to function in dynamic ecological environments. Body deformation offers athletic ability while surface characteristics provide extraordinary adaptable interactions with the environment. In this article, we discuss the recent progress of emulating the body deformation of living creatures such as shrinking/expanding, bending, and twisting and programmable deformations based on the manipulation of shape-changing behaviors of liquid-crystal polymeric materials (LCPs) and the interfacial technologies to build up various microstructures similar to the interface of living creatures. We further review the pioneering work that integrates interfacial engineering and the shape-changing modulation of LCPs to develop biomimetic soft robotic devices. We also provide an outlook for opportunities and challenges in the design and fabrication of advanced biomimetic soft robots based on the synergetic combination of interfacial engineering and shape-changing odulation.

Artificial Intelligence and the detection of pediatric concussion using epigenomic analysis,"Bahado-Singh, R.O.; Vishweswaraiah, S.; Er, A.; Aydas, B.; Turkoglu, O.; Taskin, B.D.; Duman, M.; Yilmaz, D.; Radhakrishna, U.","Concussion, also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. Currently concussion is an area of intense scientific interest to better understand the biological mechanisms and for biomarker development. We evaluated whole genome-wide blood DNA cytosine (‘CpG’) methylation in 17 pediatric concussion isolated cases and 18 unaffected controls using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC assay. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to help elucidate the epigenetic and molecular mechanisms of the disorder. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curves and FDR p-values were calculated for mTBI detection based on CpG methylation levels. Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms including Deep Learning (DL), the newest form of AI, were used to predict concussion based on i) CpG methylation markers alone, and ii) combined epigenetic, clinical and demographic predictors. We found 449 CpG sites (473 genes), those were statistically significantly methylated in mTBI compared to controls. There were four CpGs with excellent individual accuracy (AUC ≥ 0.90–1.00) while 119 displayed good accuracy (AUC ≥ 0.80–0.89) for the prediction of mTBI. The CpG methylation changes ≥10% were observed in many CpG loci after concussion suggesting biological significance. Pathway analysis identified several biologically important neurological pathways that were perturbed including those associated with: impaired brain function, cognition, memory, neurotransmission, intellectual disability and behavioral change and associated disorders. The combination of epigenomic and clinical predictors were highly accurate for the detection of concusion using AI techniques. Using DL/AI, a combination of epigenomic and clinical markers had sensitivity and specificity ≧95% for prediction of mTBI. In this novel study, we identified significant methylation changes in multiple genes in response to mTBI. Gene pathways that were epigenetically dysregulated included several known to be involved in neurological function, thus giving biological plausibility to our findings. © 2019",2020,,Brain Research,1726,,,,10.1016/j.brainres.2019.146510,,#5852,Bahado-Singh 2020,,,0
Violence recognition using convolutional neural network: A survey,"Tripathi, G.; Singh, K.; Vishwakarma, D.K.","Violence detection is a challenging task in the computer vision domain. Violence detection framework depends upon the detection of crowd behaviour changes. Violence erupts due to disagreement of an idea, injustice or severe disagreement. The aim of any country is to maintain law and order and peace in the area. Violence detection thus becomes an important task for authorities to maintain peace. Traditional methods have existed for violence detection which are heavily dependent upon hand crafted features. The world is now transitioning in to Artificial Intelligence based techniques. Automatic feature extraction and its classification from images and videos is the new norm in surveillance domain. Deep learning platform has provided us the platter on which non-linear features can be extracted, self-learnt and classified as per the appropriate tool. One such tool is the Convolutional Neural Networks, also known as ConvNets, which has the ability to automatically extract features and classify them in to their respective domain. Till date there is no survey of deciphering violence behaviour techniques using ConvNets. We hope that this survey becomes an exclusive baseline for future violence detection and analysis in the deep learning domain. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors.

Machine learning approaches along the radiology value chain - Rethinking value propositions,"Hofmann, P.; Oesterle, S.; Rust, P.; Urbach, N.","Radiology is experiencing an increased interest in machine learning with its ability to use a large amount of available data. However, it remains unclear how and to what extent machine learning will affect radiology businesses. Conducting a systematic literature review and expert interviews, we compile the opportunities and challenges of machine learning along the radiology value chain to discuss their implications for the radiology business. Machine learning can improve diagnostic quality by reducing human errors, accurately analysing large amounts of data, quantifying reports, and integrating data. Hence, it strengthens radiology businesses seeking product or service leadership. Machine learning fosters efficiency by automating accompanying activities such as generating study protocols or reports, avoiding duplicate work due to low image quality, and supporting radiologists. These efficiency improvements advance the operational excellence strategy. By providing personnel and proactive medical solutions beyond the radiology silo, machine learning supports a customer intimacy strategy. However, the opportunities face challenges that are technical (i.e., lack of data, weak labelling, and generalisation), legal (i.e., regulatory approval and privacy laws), and persuasive (i.e., radiologists' resistance and patients' distrust). Our findings shed light on the strategic positioning of radiology businesses, contributing to academic discourse and practical decision-making. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

Persuasion for good: Towards a personalized persuasive dialogue system for social good,"Wang, X.; Shi, W.; Kim, R.; Oh, Y.; Yang, S.; Zhang, J.; Yu, Z.","Developing intelligent persuasive conversational agents to change people's opinions and actions for social good is the frontier in advancing the ethical development of automated dialogue systems. To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system. 1. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics",2020,,"ACL 2019 - 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference",,,5635-5649,,,,#5855,Wang 2020,,,0
"A scoping review of patient-facing, behavioral health interventions with voice assistant technology targeting self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors","Sezgin, E.; Militello, L.K.; Huang, Y.; Lin, S.","Engaging in positive healthy lifestyle behaviors continues to be a public health challenge, requiring innovative solutions. As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/ interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.  © 2020 Society of Behavioral Medicine.",2020,,Translational Behavioral Medicine,10,3,606-628,,10.1093/tbm/ibz141,,#5856,Sezgin 2020,,,0
Artificial ant colonies for adaptive rewards in serious games,"Semet, Y.; Marcon, B.; Demestichas, K.; Koutsouris, N.; Ascolese, A.","We apply Ant Colony Optimization concepts to the problem of finding appropriate reward values after successful task completion in serious games. Our algorithm is deployed within the InLife platform, which leverages the power of serious games augmented with real-world IOT sensors for educational purposes. The platform is deployed on four actual pilot sites in Spain, France and Greece with two distinct applications: teaching sustainable behavior to university students and improving social interaction skills for autistic children. In a decentralized, swarm intelligence fashion and based on individually released success and failure pheromones, our generic reward computation strategy seeks, by adjusting reward amounts on the fly, to achieve maximum efficiency in catalyzing behavior change while balancing adaptivity, parsimony, fairness and variety. On top of the necessarily limited real-world data, large-scale numerical validation of the algorithm is obtained with a specifically designed simulator, whose underlying cognitive model was validated by a clinical psychologist. Conducted experiments confirm the relevance and adaptive nature of the obtained pheromone map: the system automatically adjusts to changes in the environment such as the introduction of new students or pedagogical items. Experiments also validate all aforementioned desired characteristics and show substantial quantitative performance gains with respect to a static reward scheme in behavior change metrics, speed and success rates, of up to 40 percent with equal reward budget.

Topic enhanced sentiment spreading model in social networks considering user interest,"Wang, X.; Jin, D.; Musial, K.; Dang, J.","Emotion is a complex emotional state, which can affect our physiology and psychology and lead to behavior changes. The spreading process of emotions in the text-based social networks is referred to as sentiment spreading. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of sentiment spreading in social networks. In particular, by employing a text-based social network (Twitter), we try to unveil the correlation between users’ sentimental statuses and topic distributions embedded in the tweets, then to automatically learn the influence strength between linked users. Furthermore, we introduce user interest to refine the influence strength. We develop a unified probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a topic-enhanced sentiment spreading model. The model can predict users’ sentimental statuses based on their historical emotional status, topic distributions in tweets and social structures. Experiments on the Twitter dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms several alternative methods in predicting users’ sentimental status. We also discover an intriguing phenomenon that positive and negative sentiment is more relevant to user interest than neutral ones. Our method offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of sentimental spreading in online social networks.

On how chronic conditions affect the patient-ai interaction: A literature review,"Sqalli, M.T.; Al-Thani, D.","Background: Across the globe, managing chronic diseases has been recognized as a challenge for patients and healthcare providers. The state of the art in managing chronic conditions requires not only responding to the clinical needs of the patient, but also guaranteeing a comfortable state of wellbeing for them, despite living with the disease. This demands mutual effort between the patient and the physician in constantly collecting data, monitoring, and understanding the disease. The advent of artificial intelligence has made this process easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to analyze how the different artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are used to manage different types of chronic conditions. Objective: Throughout this grounded theory literature review, we aim to provide an overview for the features that characterize artificial intelligence based health coaching systems used by patients with chronic diseases. Methods: During our search and paper selection process process, we use three bibliographic libraries (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library). Using the grounded theory, we extract overarching themes for the artificial intelligence based health coaching systems. These systems are then classified according to their role, platform, type of interaction with the patient, as well as targeted chronic conditions. Of 869 citations retrieved, 31 unique studies are included in this review. Results: The included studies assess 14 different chronic conditions. Common roles for AI-based health coaching systems are: developing adherence, informing, motivating, reminding, preventing, building a care network, and entertaining. Health coaching systems combine the aforementioned roles to cater to the needs of the patients. The combinations of these roles differ between multilateral, unilateral, opposing bilateral, complementing bilateral, one-role-missing, and the blurred role combinations. Conclusion: Clinical solutions and research related to artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are very limited. Clear guidelines to help develop artificial intelligence-based health coaching systems are still blurred. This grounded theory literature review attempted to shed the light on the research and development requirements for an effective health coaching system intended for patients with chronic conditions. Researchers are recommended to use this review to identify the most suitable role combination for an effective health coaching system development. © 2020 by the authors.

Prophet inequalities for Bayesian persuasion,"Hahn, N.; Hoefer, M.; Smorodinsky, R.","We study an information-structure design problem (i.e., a Bayesian persuasion problem) in an online scenario. Inspired by the classic gambler's problem, consider a set of candidates who arrive sequentially and are evaluated by one agent (the sender). This agent learns the value from hiring the candidate to herself as well as the value to another agent, the receiver. The sender provides a signal to the receiver who, in turn, makes an irrevocable decision on whether or not to hire the candidate. A-priori, for each agent the distribution of valuation is independent across candidates but may not be identical. We design good online signaling schemes for the sender. To assess the performance, we compare the expected utility to that of an optimal offline scheme by a prophet sender who knows all candidate realizations in advance. We show an optimal prophet inequality for online Bayesian persuasion, with a 1/2-approximation when the instance satisfies a “satisfactory-status-quo” assumption. Without this assumption, there are instances without any finite approximation factor. We extend the results to combinatorial domains and obtain prophet inequalities for matching with multiple hires and multiple receivers. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

Theoretical Domains Framework Applied to Cybersecurity Behaviour,"Mashiane, T.; Kritzinger, E.","The challenge of changing user cybersecurity behaviour is now in the foreground of cybersecurity research. To understand the problem, cybersecurity behaviour researchers have included, into their studies, theories from the Psychology domain. Psychology makes use of several behavioural theories to explain behaviour. This leads to the question, which of these theories are best suited to firstly understand cybersecurity behaviour and secondly to change the behaviour for the better. To answer this question, as a prelude to the current paper, previous publications have 1) established a definition for the different categories of cybersecurity behaviour, 2) identified and applied a framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework, that ties different behavioural theories together into one behaviour change framework. The current study is aimed to show the link between the behavioural constructs discussed in the Theoretical Domains Framework to the different cybersecurity behaviour categories. The contribution of the study is towards the implementors of initiatives that aim to change cybersecurity behaviour. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,1225 AISC,,411-428,,10.1007/978-3-030-51971-1_34,,#5865,Mashiane 2020,,,0
Proceedings From a Canadian Nephrology Forum: Nephrology Is Back,"Levin, A.; Sapir, D.; Steele, A.; Cherney, D.; Hellstrom, I.C.; Lanktree, M.B.; Moist, L.; Suri, R.S.","Purpose of conference: On January 18, 2020, the Nephrology is Back learning day forum was held in Toronto, ON, Canada. The objectives of the meeting were to describe recent advances in nephrology for community and academic nephrologists and patients, and to define challenges and opportunities for integration of new data into clinical practice. The intent was to test a unique forum for continuing medical education integrating physician and patient experiences with the goal of encouraging change in practice. Sources of information: Program content was based on current literature and clinical experience. Additional information was provided by patient partners who attended the meeting to provide their perspective on current issues in nephrology. Methods: A steering committee (A.L., A.S., and D.S.) developed goals and an outline for the content to be covered over the course of the meeting and led the recruitment of speakers. Speakers were asked to develop their presentations independently following direction by the committee, based on primary sources, including their own experiences. Presentations were followed by discussion including both physicians and patients, and participants had an opportunity to evaluate the conference and its outcomes. Key findings: We present a unique approach to providing continuing medical education by including both physicians and patients in the learning process. Patient perspectives accompanying presentations around data and other clinical topics provided a much different environment from other knowledge translation exercises. We believe this represents an innovative approach for knowledge translation that allows physicians to address clinical topics in a novel manner, including the integration of new findings into practice and the need to cascade this education to their peers. Limitations: Because the conference was a one-time event, it has been difficult to assess the actual clinical impact of the knowledge translation exercise and whether physician behaviors have changed as a result of the activity. The conference could also have included broader representation from across Canada. Implications: The success of this test forum among both physicians and patient partners suggests that the inclusion of patient partners in learning could have an important role in future educational initiatives. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,,Canadian Journal of Kidney Health and Disease,7,,,,10.1177/2054358120965001,,#5866,Levin 2020,,,0
Sex robot technology and the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF): A relationship in the making?,"Mainenti, D.C.","The use of sex robots is expected to become widespread in the coming decades, not only for hedonistic purposes but also for therapy, to keep the elderly company in care homes, for education, and to help couples in longdistance relationships. As new technological artifacts are introduced to society, they play a role in shaping the societal norms and belief systems while also creating tensions between various approaches and relationships, resulting in a range of policy-making proposals that bring into question traditional disciplinary boundaries that exist between the technical and the social. The Narrative Policy Framework attempts to position policy studies in such a way so as to better describe, explain, and predict a wide variety of processes and outcomes in a political world increasingly burdened by uncertain reporting, capitalistic marketing, and persuasive narratives. Through content analysis, this study identifies coalitions in the scientific community, based on results gathered from Scopus, to develop insights into the manner in which liberal, utilitarian, and conservative influences alike are shaping narrative elements and content both in favor of and against sex robot technology. © 2020 De Gruyter.

Developing embodied conversational agents for coaching people in a healthy lifestyle: Scoping review,"Kramer, L.L.; Ter Stal, S.; Mulder, B.C.; De Vet, E.; Van Velsen, L.","Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are animated computer characters that simulate face-to-face counseling. Owing to their capacity to establish and maintain an empathic relationship, they are deemed to be a promising tool for starting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Objective: This review aimed to identify the current practices in designing and evaluating ECAs for coaching people in a healthy lifestyle and provide an overview of their efficacy (on behavioral, knowledge, and motivational parameters) and use (on usability, usage, and user satisfaction parameters). Methods: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. PsycINFO, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, and Scopus were searched with a combination of terms related to ECA and lifestyle. Initially, 1789 unique studies were identified; 20 studies were included. Results: Most often, ECAs targeted physical activity (n=16) and had the appearance of a middle-aged African American woman (n=13). Multiple behavior change techniques (median=3) and theories or principles (median=3) were applied, but their interpretation and application were usually not reported. ECAs seemed to be designed for the end user rather than with the end user. Stakeholders were usually not involved. A total of 7 out of 15 studies reported better efficacy outcomes for the intervention group, and 5 out of 8 studies reported better use-related outcomes, as compared with the control group. Conclusions: ECAs are a promising tool for persuasive communication in the health domain. This review provided valuable insights into the current developmental processes, and it recommends the use of human-centered, stakeholder-inclusive design approaches, along with reporting on the design activities in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The gaps in knowledge were identified on the working mechanisms of intervention components and the right timing and frequency of coaching. © 2020 Lean L Kramer, Silke ter Stal, Bob C Mulder, Emely de Vet, Lex van Velsen.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,2,,,10.2196/14058,,#5868,Kramer 2020,,,0

Structural hole-based approach to control public opinion in a social network,"Gong, C.; Du, Y.; Li, X.; Chen, X.; Wang, Y.; Zhou, Q.","Structural hole spanners play an important role in information diffusion. Compared with opinion leaders, structural hole spanners have better locations in social networks to expand the scope of information diffusion. In the past, researchers focused on evolution rules and opinion dynamics environments to monitor and even manage public opinion. In this study, we propose a novel structural-hole-based approach to control public opinion in social networks, hereinafter referred to as the SHCPO approach. We discuss the influence of both ordinary agents and structural hole spanners on opinion evolution using our improved Friedkin–Johnsen (FJ) model. Further, we analyze the evolution tendency of public opinion, which leads to the final consensus of public opinion, via the FJ model with ordinary agents in a community and structural hole spanners in joint communities. We reveal three kinds of connections between structural hole spanners and ordinary agents in joint communities. These comprise structural hole spanners connecting (1) two opinion leaders; (2) two ordinary agents; (3) one opinion leader and one ordinary agent. The three connections will lead to different opinion evolution conditions. According to the structural balance theory, we reconstruct the social network by changing the connections between structural hole spanners and agents in different communities. This guides the public opinion tendencies of joint communities towards the positive. Experimental results demonstrate beneficial effects of the SHCPO approach. We use three evaluation indicators to compare the SHCPO approach to five alternative methods. The percentage of positive opinions is used as an evaluation indicator. The SHCPO approach, compared with adding informed agents, add edges, the method from WWW and varying susceptibility to persuasion method, which guide the agent with a negative opinion towards positive opinion, has improved about 17%, 10%, 9%, 1%, respectively. © 2020",2020,,Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence,93,,,,10.1016/j.engappai.2020.103690,,#5870,Gong 2020,,,0
A Real-Time Recommender System Design Based on Spark Streaming,"Zhang, Q.; Yu, X.; Ling, K.; Wang, T.; Zhang, B.","In the big data environment, the personalized recommender system based on offline batch processing has the advantages of accurate calculation and high fault tolerance. However, due to its large amount of calculation, it cannot satisfy the real-time requirement. At present, the real-time recommender system architecture based on the combination of offline layer and online layer also has some disadvantages in summarizing results and maintaining updates, and the recommended result depends on the offline layer. If the user behavior changes in a short time and the result update of the offline layer is lagging, the final recommendation will not reflect the user’s interest change very well. Aiming at these problems, this paper makes use of the Spark Streaming micro-batch data stream processing function to implement a real-time recommendation system. The system realized a real-time recommendation composed entirely of online stream computing based on the consistency of the user positive and negative evaluation of the item.Considering the problem of unstable data flow in the actual application scenario, the message queue Kafka is introduced to ensure the smooth and stable real-time data inflow speed. Finally, the performance of the entire system and the effectiveness of the recommendation are verified by Movielens data set. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",2020,,Communications in Computer and Information Science,1252 CCIS,,427-438,,10.1007/978-981-15-8083-3_38,,#5871,Zhang 2020,,,0
Greening food consumption using chatbots as behavioral change agent,"Cacanindin, N.M.; Palaoag, T.D.","Human consumption behavior was believed to be the primary reason for the exhaustion of natural resources resulting in undesirable destruction to the environment. Every person is aware of environmental issues, hence, consciously, environmental issues are already objects of the mind. What is lacking then is the behavioral preference for activities and practices that would lead to green consumption. This study takes an important step towards exploring messaging and conversation technologies using chatbots, to behaviorally influence the preferential consciousness of people towards green consumption. Significant topics to transform people from non-green to green food consumption behavior were explored from philosophical and ecological perspectives. To guide the fundamental design of a change agent, behavioral theories and motivation techniques were studied and subsequently integrated to develop a new behavior change agent framework. To validate the technical feasibility of the framework's design principles, theoretical underpinnings, and procedures, a functionality review of chatbot development platforms was conducted. The features provided by SnatchBot platform proved that it is possible to use chatbot as a tool to bring about behavioral change. We contribute a valuable framework that can be adapted in the design of conversational agents aimed at improving one’s well-being through the adoption of green food consumption to help effectively address the challenges presented by climate change and declining natural resource availability. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Exploring Susceptibility Measures to Persuasion,"Vargheese, J.P.; Collinson, M.; Masthoff, J.","There is increasing evidence that indicates how personalising persuasive strategies may increase the effectiveness of persuasive technologies and behaviour change interventions. This has led to a wide range of studies exploring self reported, perceived susceptibility to persuasion, which highlight the role of individual differences. Conducting such studies, while accounting for individual differences can be challenging, particularly where persuasive strategies may be considered similar due to their underlying components. In this paper, we present a study exploring perceived susceptibility to Cialdini’s principles of persuasion, with a focus on how we can distinguish perceived susceptibility measures between the most recently identified Unity principle and Social proof. This study was conducted using an online survey incorporating perceived susceptibility measures to all seven Cialdini principles and a measure of the actual effectiveness of seven corresponding persuasive strategies. Our results indicate that while we are able to distinguish perceived susceptibility measures between Unity and Social proof, together with Commitment, Scarcity and Reciprocity, we were unable to obtain these measures for Liking and Authority. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12064 LNCS,,16-29,,10.1007/978-3-030-45712-9_2,,#5873,Vargheese 2020,,,0
Persuasive Mobile Apps for Health and Wellness: A Comparative Systematic Review,"Oyebode, O.; Ndulue, C.; Alhasani, M.; Orji, R.","While majority of previous research focus on reviewing mobile health (mHealth) apps targeting specific health domain, this paper provides a comparative systematic review of mHealth apps across multiple health domains with the aim of deconstructing the persuasive strategies employed and their implementation. Specifically, we targeted four health domains (i.e., physical activity and fitness, diet, emotional and mental health, and health assessment and healthcare). We retrieved a total of 639 apps from Google Play out of which 80 popular apps were extracted (20 apps in each category). Three expert reviewers coded the apps using 32 persuasive strategies (PSs) based on Persuasive System Design (PSD) Model and Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion. Overall, out of the 80 mHealth apps reviewed, personalization is the most commonly employed PS (n = 77), followed by surface credibility (n = 69), trustworthiness (n = 66) and self-monitoring (n = 64). How the apps are implemented varies depending on the domain. Based on our findings, we offer suggestions for designing mHealth apps to improve their persuasiveness. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12064 LNCS,,163-181,,10.1007/978-3-030-45712-9_13,,#5874,Oyebode 2020,,,0
An improved and adaptive approach in ANFIS to predict knee diseases,"Kaur, R.; Kaur, K.; Khamparia, A.; Anand, D.","Artificial intelligence is emerging as a persuasive tool in the field of medical science. This research work also primarily focuses on the development of a tool to automate the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of the knee joint. The tool will also assist the physicians and medical practitioners for diagnosis. The diseases considered for this research under inflammatory category are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteonecrosis. A five-layer adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) architecture was used to model the system. The ANFIS system works by mapping input parameters to the input membership functions, input membership functions are mapped to the rules generated by the ANFIS model which are further mapped to the output membership function. A comparative performance analysis of fuzzy system and ANFIS system is also done and results generated shows that the ANFIS system outperformed fuzzy system in terms of testing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

Estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence,"Yang, Y.; Youyou, W.; Uzzi, B.","Replicability tests of scientific papers show that the majority of papers fail replication. Moreover, failed papers circulate through the literature as quickly as replicating papers. This dynamic weakens the literature, raises research costs, and demonstrates the need for new approaches for estimating a study's replicability. Here, we trained an artificial intelligence model to estimate a paper's replicability using ground truth data on studies that had passed or failed manual replication tests, and then tested the model's generalizability on an extensive set of out-of-sample studies. The model predicts replicability better than the base rate of reviewers and comparably as well as prediction markets, the best present-day method for predicting replicability. In out-of-sample tests on manually replicated papers from diverse disciplines and methods, the model had strong accuracy levels of 0.65 to 0.78. Exploring the reasons behind the model's predictions, we found no evidence for bias based on topics, journals, disciplines, base rates of failure, persuasion words, or novelty words like “remarkable” or “unexpected.” We did find that the model's accuracy is higher when trained on a paper's text rather than its reported statistics and that n-grams, higher order word combinations that humans have difficulty processing, correlate with replication. We discuss how combining human and machine intelligence can raise confidence in research, provide research self-assessment techniques, and create methods that are scalable and efficient enough to review the ever-growing numbers of publications-a task that entails extensive human resources to accomplish with prediction markets and manual replication alone. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

Persuading from the Start: Participatory Development of Sustainable Persuasive Data-Driven Technologies in Healthcare,"Keizer, J.; Jong, N.B.-D.; Naiemi, N.A.; van Gemert-Pijnen, J.E.W.C.","Data-driven technologies can persuade humans to optimize their behavior and context based on objective data. However, current data-driven technologies have limited persuasive powers, because of a misfit between technology, end-users and context. Neglecting end-users in the development process contributes to this misfit and to limited engagement with the to-be-developed technology. This threatens sustainable (long-term) implementation. Therefore, this paper demonstrates how a bottom-up participatory development approach can improve the persuasive design of data-driven technologies and simultaneously increase engagement of end-users to foster sustainable implementation.

Measuring the Strength of Rhetorical Arguments,"Morveli-Espinoza, M.; Nieves, J.C.; Tacla, C.A.","Rhetorical arguments are used in negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to persuade his opponent to accept a proposal more readily. When more than one argument is generated, the proponent must compare them in order to select the most adequate for his interests. A way of comparing them is by means of their strength values. Related articles propose a calculation based only on the components of the rhetorical arguments, i.e., the importance of the opponent’s goal and the certainty level of the beliefs that make up the argument. This article aims to propose a model for the measurement of the strength of rhetorical arguments, which is inspired on the pre-conditions of credibility and preferability stated by Guerini and Castelfranchi. Thus, we suggest the use of two new criteria to the strength calculation: the credibility of the proponent and the status of the opponent’s goal in the goal processing cycle. The model is empirically evaluated and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is more efficient than previous works of the state of the art in terms of number of exchanged arguments and number of reached agreements. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12520 LNAI,,415-430,,10.1007/978-3-030-66412-1_26,,#5879,Morveli-Espinoza 2020,,,0

In this paper, we rely on the deep penetration of mobile phones in order to influence citizens’ behavior through data-driven mobility and persuasive profiles. Our proposed approach aims to nudge users on a personalized level in order to change their mobility behavior and make more sustainable choices. To achieve our goal, first we leverage pervasive mobile sensing to uncover users’ mobility patterns and use of transportation modes. Second, we construct users’ persuadability profiles by considering their personality and mobility behavior. With the use of the aforementioned information we generate personalized interventions that nudge users to adopt sustainable transportation habits. These interventions rely on persuasive technologies and are embedded in a route planning application for smartphones.

An Empirical Study on the Lane-Change Duration of Naturalistic Driving Based on Multiple Linear Regression Model,"Yuan, Y.; Li, Y.; Bao, H.","In China, where the driving environment is extremely complicated, lane-change scene occurs frequently and its impact is prominent. Analysis of lane changing driving behavior can not only provide a certain theoretical support for traffic managers, but also provide a reference basis for the development of advanced driver assistance systems. In view of the current Chinese research gaps in the model of lane-change duration, this article focuses on the lane-change duration. Firstly, using mathematical statistics to describe the general situation of lane changing behavior characteristics in common driving scenarios; then using simple univariate linear regression method to analyze the relationship between each parameter and the lane changing duration; and then, establishing a multivariate linear regression model including all independent variables, and use forward stepwise regression to screen the model parameters. There is a certain degree of improvement after the model is optimized to acquire higher determination coefficient, the overall linear significance, and the significance level of some variables.

(When) is truth-telling favored in AI debate?,"Kovařík, V.; Carey, R.","For some problems, it is difficult for humans to judge the goodness of AI-proposed solutions. Irving, Christiano, and Amodei (2018) propose that in such cases, we may use a debate between two AI systems to assist the human judge to select a good answer. We introduce a mathematical framework for modelling this type of debate and propose that the quality of debate designs may be measured by the accuracy of the most persuasive answer. We describe a simple instance of the debate framework called feature debate and analyze the degree to which such debates track the truth. We argue that despite being very simple, feature debates capture many aspects of practical debates such as the incentives to confuse the judge or stall to prevent losing. We analyze two special types of debates, those where arguments constitute independent evidence about the topic, and those where the information bandwidth of the judge is limited. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.",2020,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2560,,128-137,,,,#5889,Kovařík 2020,,,0
Role of artificial intelligence in operations environment: a review and bibliometric analysis,"Dhamija, P.; Bag, S.","Purpose: “Technological intelligence” is the capacity to appreciate and adapt technological advancements, and “artificial intelligence” is the key to achieve persuasive operational transformations in majority of contemporary organizational set-ups. Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics.

Analysis of the persuasiveness of argumentation in popular science texts,"Zagorulko, Y.; Domanov, O.; Sery, A.; Sidorova, E.; Borovikova, O.","The paper discusses the methods of modeling and assessing the quality of the argumentation used in popular science texts, as well as the software supporting them. First, the authors study the aspects of argumentation persuasiveness, i.e. the validity of conclusions presented in articles. Argumentation modeling is performed using the argumentation ontology based on the AIF format (Argument Interchange Format), which was adopted by the international community as a standard notation for describing arguments and argumentation schemes. The authors have supplemented this ontology with the facilities necessary for modeling and analyzing the quality of argumentation in popular science discourse. In particular, we have introduced into the ontology facilities allowing us to assign the estimates of persuasiveness (degree of the truth) to the arguments and statements and to model the target audience. Thanks to these facilities, it has become possible to analyze the persuasiveness of the argumentation regarding different target audiences. To solve this problem, the authors propose a model and an algorithm for calculating the persuasiveness of arguments allowing taking into account conflicts between the arguments. The paper also provides an example of constructing a network of arguments and calculating the degree of their persuasiveness using the software system developed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2020,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12412 LNAI,,351-367,,10.1007/978-3-030-59535-7_26,,#5891,Zagorulko 2020,,,0
Private Bayesian persuasion with sequential games,"Celli, A.; Coniglio, S.; Gatti, N.","We study an information-structure design problem (a.k.a. a persuasion problem) with a single sender and multiple receivers with actions of a priori unknown types, independently drawn from action-specific marginal probability distributions. As in the standard Bayesian persuasion model, the sender has access to additional information regarding the action types, which she can exploit when committing to a (noisy) signaling scheme through which she sends a private signal to each receiver. The novelty of our model is in considering the much more expressive case in which the receivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with utilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After formalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ by the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling scheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a signaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue. We show that computing an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme is NP-hard when there are three or more receivers. Instead, in contrast with previous hardness results for ex interim persuasion, we show that, for games with two receivers, an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time thanks to the novel algorithm we propose, based on the ellipsoid method.

Digital advertising to children,"Radesky, J.; Chassiakos, Y.R.; Ameenuddin, N.; Navsaria, D.; Boyd, R.; Selkie, E.; Patrick, M.; Friedman, J.; Evans, Y.; Tomopoulos, S.; Bhargava, H.; Hutchinson, J.; Bracho-Sanchez, E.","Advertising to children and teenagers is a multibillion-dollar industry. This policy statement reviews the forms of advertising that children and teenagers encounter, including newer forms of digital marketing, such as sponsored content, influencers, data collection, persuasive design, and personalized behavioral marketing driven by machine learning. Parents and pediatric health care providers need to be aware of the ways different marketing messages reach children and teenagers, including Internet sites, social media, and mobile apps. Evidence suggests that exposure to advertising is associated with unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient food and beverages; use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes; use of alcohol and marijuana; and indoor tanning. Children are uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive effects of advertising because of immature critical thinking skills and impulse inhibition. School-aged children and teenagers may be able to recognize advertising but often are not able to resist it when it is embedded within trusted social networks, encouraged by celebrity influencers, or delivered next to personalized content. This policy statement expresses concern about the practice of tracking and using children's digital behavior to inform targeted marketing campaigns, which may contribute to health disparities among vulnerable children or populations. Pediatricians should guide parents and children to develop digital literacy skills to prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, but it is equally important that policy makers and technology companies embrace digital design, data collection, and marketing practices within today's broad digital environment that support healthier decision-making and outcomes.

Specifically, we focus on the dominant emotions and personality based on the OCEAN and the OCC models. Our aim is to show the influence of these models of the human behavior in crises. Our architecture contains also a metric module that computes the distance between an agent and the emergency exits, the outputs of this module affect the intensity of the agent's emotions and accordingly the agent's behavior.

PerMEASS - Personal mental health virtual assistant with novel ambient intelligence integration,"Kolenik, T.; Gjoreski, M.; Gams, M.","This paper describes the design for a personal mental health virtual assistant with novel ambient intelligence integration - PerMEASS. It is specifically designed to provide help for three mental health issues: stress, anxiety and depression. Its assistance in these issues is based on two very closely related and trending multidisciplinary computer science fields - persuasive technology and digital behavior change intervention, which both research ways to affect human behavior or attitudes with technology, but without coercion or deception. A short overview of such assistants focuses on three of them, which represent state of the art. PerMEASS is described in more detail and compared to state of the art to showcase how it advances the existing solutions. The focus is on two parts of PerMEASS' cognitive architecture that present novel contributions: 1) a model of the theory of mind, a cognitive ability to understand other people and act appropriately, 2) an integration with ambient intelligence - artificial intelligence in the environment - in the form of a smart bracelet. PerMEASS' theory of mind is used to build a user model and utilize mental health and behavior change ontologies to devise effective and personalized strategies. At the same time, reinforcement learning is used to evaluate the strategies in real-time and use only the ones that are successful, making PerMEASS very adaptive. PerMEASS uses a smart bracelet to achieve this goal as well. The integration of the assistant with a device to collect biophysiological data in real-time pushes the assistant technology into new, so far unexplored directions. Our future work consists of firm implementation of the design and testing it in randomized controlled trials.

Comparison of a collective intelligence tailored messaging system on smoking cessation between African American and white people who smoke: Quasi-experimental design,"Faro, J.M.; Nagawa, C.S.; Allison, J.A.; Lemon, S.C.; Mazor, K.M.; Houston, T.K.; Sadasivam, R.S.","Background: The Patient Experience Recommender System for Persuasive Communication Tailoring (PERSPeCT) is a machine learning recommender system with a database of messages to motivate smoking cessation. PERSPeCT uses the collective intelligence of users (ie, preferences and feedback) and demographic and smoking profiles to select motivating messages. PERSPeCT may be more beneficial for tailoring content to minority groups influenced by complex, personally relevant factors. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe and evaluate the use of PERSPeCT in African American people who smoke compared with white people who smoke. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared African American people who smoke with a historical cohort of white people who smoke, who both received up to 30 emailed tailored messages over 65 days. People who smoke rated the daily message in terms of perceived influence on quitting smoking for 30 days. Our primary analysis compared daily message ratings between the two groups using a t test. We used a logistic model to compare 30-day cessation between the two groups and adjusted for covariates. Results: The study included 119 people who smoke (African Americans, 55/119; whites, 64/119). At baseline, African American people who smoke were significantly more likely to report allowing smoking in the home (P=.002); all other characteristics were not significantly different between groups. Daily mean ratings were higher for African American than white people who smoke on 26 of the 30 days (P<.001). Odds of quitting as measured by 30-day cessation were significantly higher for African Americans (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.04-5.53; P=.03) and did not change after adjusting for allowing smoking at home. Conclusions: Our study highlighted the potential of using a recommender system to personalize for African American people who smoke. © Jamie M Faro, Catherine S Nagawa, Jeroan A Allison, Stephenie C Lemon, Kathleen M Mazor, Thomas K Houston, Rajani S Sadasivam.",2020,,JMIR mHealth and uHealth,8,4,,,10.2196/18064,,#5899,Faro 2020,,,0
Adapting the markov chain based algorithm m-dbscan to detect opponents' strategy changes in the dynamic scenario of a starcraft player agent,"Vieira, E.; Julia, R.M.S.; Faria, E.R.","Digital games represent an appropriate test scenario to investigate the agents' ability to detect changes in the behavior of other agents trying to prevent them from fulfilling their objectives. Such ability allows the agents to adapt their decision-making process to adequately deal with those changes. The Markov Chain based algorithm M-DBScan is a successful tool conceived to detect novelties in data stream scenarios. Such algorithm has been validated in artificially controlled situations in games in which a single set of features and a single Markov Chain are sufficient to represent the data and to detect the occurrence of novelties, which usually is not enough to make the agents able to adequately perceive the environment changes in real game situations. The main contribution of the present work is then to investigate how to improve the use of M-DBScan as a tool for detecting behavior changes in the context of real and dynamic StarCraft games by using distinct sets of features and Markov Chains to represent the peculiarities of relevant game stages. Further, distinctly from the existing researches, here M-DBScan is validated in situations in which the timestamp, between successive novelties, is not constant. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The development trend of design methodology under the influence of artificial intelligence and big data,"Shu, W.; Sun, F.; Li, Y.","Traditional design methods are inspired by introverted self-salvation or creativity-driven design. In the era of big data, they are gradually driven by vast data. Design innovation without data is increasingly lacking in persuasion. The design of data participation increasingly faces market risks. Moreover, with the progress of artificial intelligence, such a technological innovation will eventually deconstruct the existing field of design innovation, its impact will continue, and it may fundamentally spawn new design ideas and methods.  © 2020 ACM.",2020,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,104-108,,10.1145/3417188.3417214,,#5902,Shu 2020,,,0

A concurrent language for argumentation,"Bistarelli, S.; Taticchi, C.","While agent-based modelling languages naturally implement concurrency, the currently available languages for argumentation do not allow to explicitly model this type of interaction. In this paper we introduce a concurrent language for handling process arguing and communicating using a shared argumentation framework (reminding shared constraint store as in concurrent constraint). We introduce also basic expansions, contraction and revision procedures as main bricks for enforcement, debate, negotiation and persuasion.

Numerical abstract persuasion argumentation for expressing concurrent multi-agent negotiations,"Arisaka, R.; Ito, T.","A negotiation process by 2 agents e1 and e2 can be interleaved by another negotiation process between, say, e1 and e3. The interleaving may alter the resource allocation assumed at the inception of the first negotiation process. Existing proposals for argumentation-based negotiations have focused primarily on two-agent bilateral negotiations, but scarcely on the concurrency of multi-agent negotiations. To fill the gap, we present a novel argumentation theory, basing its development on abstract persuasion argumentation (which is an abstract argumentation formalism with a dynamic relation). Incorporating into it numerical information and a mechanism of handshakes among members of the dynamic relation, we show that the extended theory adapts well to concurrent multi-agent negotiations over scarce resources. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2020,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12158 LNAI,,131-149,,10.1007/978-3-030-56150-5_7,,#5907,Arisaka 2020,,,0
A Primer on Integral Theory and Its Application to Mental Health Care,"Duffy, J.D.","Contemporary psychiatry has become increasingly focused on biological treatments. Many critics claim that the current paradigm of psychiatry has failed to address the escalating mental health-care needs of our communities and may even be contributing to psychopathology and the burden of mental illness. This article describes the foundations of Integral Theory and proposes that this model offers a framework for developing integral psychiatry and a more effective and compassionate mental health-care system. An integral model of psychiatry extends biopsychosocial approaches and provides the scaffolding for more effective approaches to integrative mental health care. Furthermore, rather than focusing on psychopathology, the Integral theory model describes the emergence of human consciousness and supports a mental health-care system that addresses mental illness but also promotes human flourishing. © The Author(s) 2020.",2020,,Global Advances In Health and Medicine,9,,,,10.1177/2164956120952733,,#5908,Duffy 2020,,,0

Persuasive Synthetic Speech: Voice Perception and User Behaviour,"Dubiel, M.; Halvey, M.; Gallegos, P.O.; King, S.","Previous research indicates that synthetic speech can be as persuasive as human speech. However, there is a lack of empirical validation on interactive goal-oriented tasks. In our two-stage study (online listening test and lab evaluation), we compared participants' perception of the persuasiveness of synthetic voices created from speech in a debating style vs. speech from audio-books. Participants interacted with our Conversational Agent (CA) to complete 4 flight-booking tasks and were asked to evaluate the voice, message and perceived personal qualities. We found that participants who interacted with the CA using the voice created from debating style speech rated it as significantly more truthful and more involved than the CA using the audio-book-based voice. However, there was no difference in how frequently each group followed the CA's recommendations. We hope our investigation will provoke discussion about the impact of different synthetic voices on users' perceptions of CAs in goal-oriented tasks. © 2020 ACM.",2020,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,,,10.1145/3405755.3406120,,#5910,Dubiel 2020,,,0
Behaviour change for the sharing economy,"Deleris, L.; Mac Aonghusa, P.","Our understanding of human behavior and how to effect changes in behavior have evolved to the point where behavior change techniques have been applied successfully in areas as diverse as public health, advertising and retail. Despite its successes, behavior change science remains largely unknown among the engineering and technology community. In this chapter we provide a brief introduction to a vast field of knowledge. We describe practical behavior change tools and techniques that can be used to design behavioral interventions as elements of complex projects such as are typical of the sharing economy. Structured design of behavioral change programs is discussed and key concepts discussed followed by an overview of important techniques such as the COM-B Model, the Behavior Change Wheel. The Taxonomy of Behavior Change Techniques we discuss sits in an exciting area of active research using ontology techniques to organize knowledge. This approach lends itself naturally to application of technological tools such as artificial intelligence. Behavior change is a rapidly evolving science with sufficient rigorous and structured underpinnings to support more holistic design of complex projects where human behaviors are critical to sustainability and long-term success. We invite the reader to see this chapter as a practical introduction and to use the accompanying references to explore the literature around this fascinating subject. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2020,,"Analytics for the Sharing Economy: Mathematics, Engineering and Business Perspectives",,,173-187,,10.1007/978-3-030-35032-1_11,,#5911,Deleris 2020,,,0
Mind the (persuasion) gap: Contrasting predictions of intelligent DSS with user beliefs to improve interpretability,"Chromik, M.; Fincke, F.; Butz, A.","Decision support systems (DSS) help users to make more informed and more effective decisions. In recent years, many intelligent DSS (IDSS) in business contexts involve machine learning (ML) methods, which make them inherently hard to explain and comprehend logically. Incomprehensible predictions, however, might violate the users' expectations. While explanations can help with this, prior research also shows that providing explanations in all situations may negatively impact trust and adherence, especially for users experienced in the decision task at hand. We used a human-centered design approach with domain experts to design a DSS for funds management in the construction industry and identified a strong need for control, personal involvement, and adequate data. To create an adequate level of trust and reliance, we contrasted the system's predictions with the values derived from an analytic hierarchical process (AHP), which makes the relative importance of our users' decision-making criteria explicit. We developed a prototype and evaluated its acceptance with 7 construction industry experts. By identifying situations in which the ML prediction and the domain expert potentially disagree, the DSS can identify a persuasion gap and use explanations more selectively. Our evaluation showed promising results and we plan to generalize our approach to a wider range of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) problems, e.g., to provide explanations with arguments tailored to the user. © 2020 ACM.",2020,,"EICS 2020 - 12th ACM SIG CHI Symposium on Engineering Interactive Computing Systems, Proceedings",,,,,10.1145/3393672.3398491,,#5913,Chromik 2020,,,0
Cultural challenges of the malicious use of artificial intelligence in Latin American regional balance,"Batista, R.; Villar, O.; González, H.; Milián, V.","This paper surveys the landscape of potential security threats from malicious use of artificial intelligence technologies (MUAI) in Latin America. This study is based on scenario analysis to identify the MUAI-related cultural threats for region geopolitical balance. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities stimulates the transition to a new technological order. These technologies with indeed many social applications benefits also transform nations power relations and lead to the new threats and vulnerabilities in the field of international psychological security (IPS), turning artificial intelligence and geopolitics more closer and challenging democracy and national security traditional models. AI-based technologies interact with peoples cognitive assumptions and provide any individual, group, organisation or nation-state to influence on public consciousness as a new kind of weapon in the global system. Research results look at how behavior, self-efficacy and privacy attitude are affected by culture compared to other psychological and demographics variables. It also examines what kind of data people tend to share online and how culture affects these choices. This study presents a multi-cultural view of MUAI for regional balance in Latin America, supports the idea of cultural competency as a mechanism of social influence and sets the distribution of power from the notion of security as a socio-cultural phenomenon. AI is highly likely to have different social impacts for region geopolitical balance depending on people cultural settings traced by customs, values and behaviours. This paper confirms that MUAI elevates threats to IPS to a qualitatively new level, which requires an adequate assessment and reaction from society. The comprehension of cross-cultural new threats of MUAI lead to formulate large-scale strategies to protect the sovereignty and enforce regional roles for building consensus, engagement and international collaboration, and forced experts to assume the ethic implications of surveillance, persuasion, and physical target identification for region balance. © ECIAIR 2020.All right reserved.",2020,,"Proceedings of the European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2020",,,Jul-13,,10.34190/EAIR.20.029,,#5915,Batista 2020,,,0
My therapist: A cognitive approach towards natural language processing,"Briskilal, J.; Singh, A.; Ojha, D.","Talk therapy (which is also known as psychotherapy) is an important and growing field to a range of treatment for depression, bipolar disorder or other mood disorders. A good therapist can help a person to cope with his or her feelings and thought patterns and adapt to their sentiments by problem solving and changing behavior patterns that may contribute to the cognitive distortions or the disorder’s symptoms.While Conversational AI is the study of techniques and strategies for software agents that can engage in natural conversational interactions with humans. As of late, many conversational interfaces/assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, J.A.R.V.I.S and others have become a focal point in both academic and industrial research because of their rapid market uptake and rapidly increasing range and scope of capabilities. The first generation of these Conversational assistants have been focused on short errand situated discourse as opposed to longer freestyle discussions and task-oriented dialog rather than longer free-form conversations that occur naturally in social, emotional and professional human interaction using human language. Achieving sustained, coherent, intelligible and engaging dialog are the next frontiers for conversational AI. Adding to these features of a conversational AI using NLP, introduction of a conversational therapeutic assistant which will help in these various procedures of psychotherapy and treatment of these mental disorders using Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) which is a short-term therapy technique approach that can help people find new ways to induce behavioral changes by changing their thought patterns. © 2020 SERSC.",2020,,International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology,29,6,2510-2522,,,,#5916,Briskilal 2020,,,0
Looking beneath the tip of the iceberg: The two-sided nature of chatbots and their roles for digital feedback exchange,"Lechler, R.; Stöckli, E.; Rietsche, R.; Uebernickel, F.","Enterprises are forecasted to spend more on chatbots than on mobile app development by 2021. Up to today little is known on the roles chatbots play in facilitating feedback exchange. However, digitization and automation put pressure on companies to setup digital work environments that enable reskilling of employees. Therefore, a structured analysis of feedback-related chatbots for Slack was conducted. Our results propose six archetypes that reveal the roles of chatbots in facilitating feedback exchange on performance, culture and ideas. We show that chatbots do not only consist of conversational agents integrated into instant messenger but are tightly linked to complementary front-end systems such as mobile and web apps. Like the upper part of an iceberg, the conversational agent is above water and visible within the chat, whereas many user interactions of feedback-related chatbots are only possible outside of the instant messenger. Further, we extract six design principles for chatbots as digital feedback systems. We do this by analyzing chatbots and linking empirically observed design features to (meta-)requirements derived from explanatory theory on feedback, self-determination and persuasive systems. The results suggest that chatbots benefit the social environment of conversation agents and the richness of the graphical user interface of external applications. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

SDN-Enabled IoT Anomaly Detection Using Ensemble Learning,"Tsogbaatar, E.; Bhuyan, M.H.; Taenaka, Y.; Fall, D.; Gonchigsumlaa, K.; Elmroth, E.; Kadobayashi, Y.","Internet of Things (IoT) devices are inherently vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. Aggressive behavior change, due to increased attacker’s sophistication, and the heterogeneity of the data in IoT have proven that securing IoT devices is a making challenge. To detect intensive attacks and increase device uptime, we propose a novel ensemble learning model for IoT anomaly detection using software-defined networks (SDN). We use a deep auto-encoder to extract handy features for stacking into an ensemble learning model. The learned model is deployed in the SDN controller to detect anomalies or dynamic attacks in IoT by addressing the class imbalance problem. We validate the model with real-time testbed and benchmark datasets. The initial results show that our model has a better and more reliable performance than the competing models showcased in the relevant related work. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",2020,,IFIP Advances in Information and Communication Technology,584 IFIP,,268-280,,10.1007/978-3-030-49186-4_23,,#5918,Tsogbaatar 2020,,,0

Hypnotic computer interface (hypCI) using GEORGIE: An approach to design discrete voice user interfaces,"Ramadas, R.; Chowdhury, A.","Voice User Interfaces have become popular with the advent of Alexa, Google Home, Cortana and other commercial speech recognition interfaces; however, the privacy of the end users is compromised while using these interfaces in public. In addition, users can feel a bit awkward while using these interfaces with loud voice while they are outside their homes. Contextually, 'Hypnosis' and 'Hypnotherapy' have not been frequently applied as a way of human communications although the principle of suggestion induced behavior changes in an interesting approach to interact with machines. In this paper, GEORGIE a prototype AI was used to achieve a novel means of interaction inspired from the principles of hypnotherapy, which is a discrete interface ensuring that end-users' privacy is not compromised. It is envisaged that people who prefer secret communication and interaction might love to use this hypnotic computer interface (hypCI).

From intelligent energy management to value economy through a digital energy currency: Bahrain city case study,"Marinakis, V.; Doukas, H.; Koasidis, K.; Albuflasa, H.","The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans. © 2020 by the authors.

Detecting node behaviour changes in subgraphs,"Gibson, M.S.","Most interactions or relationships among objects or entities can be modelled as graphs. Some classes of entity relationships have their own name due to their popularity; social graphs look at people’s relationships, computer networks show how computers (devices) communicate with each other and molecules represent the chemical bonds between atoms. Some graphs can also be dynamic in the sense that, over time, relationships change. Since the entities can, to a certain extent, manage their relationships, we say any changes in relationships reflect a change in entity behaviour. By comparing the relationships of an entity at different points in time, we can say there has been a change in behaviour. In this paper, we attempt to detect malicious devices in a network by showing a significant change in behaviour through analysing traffic data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",2020,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),12498 LNAI,,152-158,,10.1007/978-3-030-63799-6_12,,#5925,Gibson 2020,,,0
Persuasion meets AI: Ethical considerations for the design of social engineering countermeasures,"Díaz Ferreyra, N.E.; Aímeur, E.; Hage, H.; Heisel, M.; Van Hoogstraten, C.G.","Privacy in Social Network Sites (SNSs) like Facebook or Instagram is closely related to people's selfdisclosure decisions and their ability to foresee the consequences of sharing personal information with large and diverse audiences. Nonetheless, online privacy decisions are often based on spurious risk judgements that make people liable to reveal sensitive data to untrusted recipients and become victims of social engineering attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combination with persuasive mechanisms like nudging is a promising approach for promoting preventative privacy behaviour among the users of SNSs. Nevertheless, combining behavioural interventions with high levels of personalization can be a potential threat to people's agency and autonomy even when applied to the design of social engineering countermeasures. This paper elaborates on the ethical challenges that nudging mechanisms can introduce to the development of AI-based countermeasures, particularly to those addressing unsafe self-disclosure practices in SNSs. Overall, it endorses the elaboration of personalized risk awareness solutions as i) an ethical approach to counteract social engineering, and ii) as an effective means for promoting reflective privacy decisions.

Does the psychopathology of the parents predict the developmental-emotional problems of the toddlers?,"Usta, M.B.; Karabekiroğlu, K.","Introduction: Parental psychopathology has been defined in respect of psychopathological development in early childhood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of parental psychopathologies on social and emotional problems in the age range of 1–3 years and to determine children at risk. Methods: The study data were obtained from the 2009 Early Childhood Mental Health Profile taking population distribution into consideration with the properties representing Turkey. The primary caregiver of the child completed the Psychiatric Evaluation Form for 1–3 years, the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) for themselves. Machine learning models used for prediction. The performance of prediction models was evaluated with the ten-fold cross-validation method. Area Under Curve (AUC) values were calculated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the performance of each model. Results: The evaluation was made of the data of 2775 children, comprising 1507 (54.3%) males and 1268 (45.7%) females with a mean age of 26.19±9.11 months (range, 10–48 months). A total of 106 children were identified as at risk, as they were above the clinical cut-off point (1.5 standard deviations) of the BITSEA points and below the cut-off points of any one of the developmental areas of the ASQ. Modeling was applied to the data of these 106 children. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was selected for prediction with the automatically optimized highest AUC value. Weighting for the SVM algorithm showed mothers’ BSI scores, fathers’ education and health problems, duration of breastfeeding, unplanned pregnancy are significant for predicting BITSEA-problem scores in the model. Conclusion: To be able to understand the complex relationship with parental psychopathology and behavioral problems, machine learning methods were used successfully in this study. Further studies with more massive data sets, more extended follow-up periods, and stronger algorithms will be able to identify risk groups earlier and allow early interventions to be implemented. © 2020 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.",2020,,Noropsikiyatri Arsivi,57,4,265-269,,10.29399/npa.25074,,#5928,Usta 2020,,,0

Acceptability of artificial intelligence (AI)-led chatbot services in healthcare: A mixed-methods study,"Nadarzynski, T.; Miles, O.; Cowie, A.; Ridge, D.","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants’ willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods: The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results: Three broad themes: ‘Understanding of chatbots’, ‘AI hesitancy’ and ‘Motivations for health chatbots’ were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13–3.25]. Conclusion: Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients’ concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients’ perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots. © The Author(s) 2019.",2019,,Digital Health,5,,,,10.1177/2055207619871808,,#5931,Nadarzynski 2019,,,0
Involving students in the learning process: Using team competition to teach gas turbine cycle design,"van Treuren, K.","Active learning is an important part of modern engineering education. It directly engages students in the learning process, helping them think and creatively solve problems. Often this is done in the context of a team project involving group activities both inside and outside the classroom. Analysis and Design of Propulsion Systems is an elective course that has been a traditional lecture course at Baylor University, teaching gas turbine engines using cycle design. In an effort to involve the students more in the learning process, active learning modules were introduced to make the course more interactive. The active learning modules involved assigning students into teams of four that were formed using the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) software. Each team was to operate as a commercial company which included picking a name, developing a logo, and writing a mission statement similar to actual commercial companies. The point of having each team become a commercial company was to foster competition. The companies were tasked to eventually design the lowest cost, most efficient high bypass turbofan engine to replace the existing engines on the B-52H bomber. Each company wrote a persuasive position paper on whether or not the B-52H should be re-engined and a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the re-engined B-52H. Gas turbine cycle design occurred using a three part design project. The engine cycle of choice for this re-design was the high bypass turbofan. Phase one was a detailed mission analysis incorporating the requirements from the RFP and leading to the selection of a design point, the calculation of the required installed thrust for each leg (and consequently the uninstalled thrust for each leg), as well as an average uninstalled specific fuel consumption for the mission. On-design, the next phase in the design process, used an on-design analysis at the design point which resulted in a selection of a fan pressure ratio, an overall pressure ratio, and a bypass ratio. The last phase examined the chosen engine at off-design mission points and the final fuel was calculated using actual uninstalled specific fuel consumption values to assure the fuel reserve was met. All phases were incorporated into a final report. To conclude the process, each team presented their engine as if they were a company seeking to sell their product to a customer. The customer, the professor, then picked an overall winner based on the information presented. Assessment of the course showed that the students appreciated the competitive environment giving them insight into how a gas turbine company might operate. In conclusion, the active learning modules and team competition with the design project were effective in challenging and exciting the students about the design of gas turbine engines. The company context for teams prepares students for what to expect should they work in the gas turbine industry.

Demonstrating the Distinctions Between Persuasion and Deliberation Dialogues,"Kirchev, Y.; Atkinson, K.; Bench-Capon, T.","A successful dialogue requires that the participants have a shared understanding of what they are trying to achieve, individually and collectively. This coordination can be achieved if both recognise the type of dialogue in which they are engaged. We focus on two particular dialogue types, action persuasion and deliberation dialogues, which are often conflated because they share similar speech acts. Previously, a clear distinction was made between the two in terms of the different pre- and post-conditions used for the speech acts within these dialogues. This prior work gave formal specifications of the dialogue moves within the dialogues but offered no evaluation through implementation. In this paper, we present an implementation to demonstrate that the two dialogue types described in this way can be realised in software to support focussed communication between autonomous agents. We provide the design and implementation details of our new tool along with an evaluation of the software. The tool we have produced captures the distinctive features of each of the two dialogue types, to make plain their differences and to validate the speech acts for use in practical scenarios. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11927 LNAI,,93-106,,10.1007/978-3-030-34885-4_7,,#5933,Kirchev 2019,,,0
"An expandable approach for design and personalization of digital, just-in-time adaptive interventions","Gonul, S.; Namli, T.; Huisman, S.; Erturkmen, G.B.L.; Toroslu, I.H.; Cosar, A.","Objective: We aim to deliver a framework with 2 main objectives: 1) facilitating the design of theory-driven, adaptive, digital interventions addressing chronic illnesses or health problems and 2) producing personalized intervention delivery strategies to support self-management by optimizing various intervention components tailored to people's individual needs, momentary contexts, and psychosocial variables. Materials and Methods: We propose a template-based digital intervention design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based, just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions. Results: We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns. Conclusion: While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery strategies for simulated real-life conditions. © 2018 The Author(s).",2019,,Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association,26,3,198-210,,10.1093/jamia/ocy160,,#5934,Gonul 2019,,,0
Combining behavior change intentions and user types to select suitable gamification elements for persuasive fitness systems,"Altmeyer, M.; Lessel, P.; Muller, L.; Krüger, A.","The motivational impact of gamification elements differs substantially across users. To account for these differences, we investigate Hexad user types and behavior change intentions as factors to personalize gamifed, persuasive fitness systems. We conducted an online study (N = 179), measuring the perceived persuasiveness of twelve gamification elements using storyboards. Results show the applicability of the Hexad user type in the Physical Activity domain. Besides replicating correlations between gamification elements and user types, we also found correlations which were hypothesized in literature, but not yet shown. Our main contribution is to show that behavior change intentions influence the perception of gamification elements in general and affect the set of relevant elements for each user type. Since a static set of elements has been suggested for each user type so far, this is an important finding, leading to potentially more effective personalization approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11433 LNCS,,337-349,,10.1007/978-3-030-17287-9_27,,#5935,Altmeyer 2019,,,0
Modelling therapeutic alliance using a user-aware explainable embodied conversational agent to promote treatment adherence,"Abdulrahman, A.; Richards, D.","Non-adherence? to a treatment plan recommended by the therapist is a key cause of the increasing rate of chronic medical conditions globally. The therapist-patient therapeutic alliance is regarded as a successful intervention and a good predictor of treatment adherence. Similar to the human scenario, embodied conversational agents (ECAs) showed evidence of their ability to build an agent-patient therapeutic alliance, which motivates the effort to advance ECAs as a potential solution to improve treatment adherence and consequently the health outcome. Building therapeutic alliance implies the need for a positive environment where the ECA and the patient can share their knowledge and discuss their goals, preferences and tasks towards building a shared plan, which is commonly done using explanations. However, explainable agents commonly rely on their own knowledge and goals in providing explanations, rather than the beliefs, plans or goals of the user. It is not clear whether such explanations, in individual-specific contexts such as personal health assistance, are perceived by the user as relevant in decision-making towards their own behavior change. Therefore, in this research, we are developing a user-aware explainable ECA by embedding the cognitive agent architecture with a user model, explanation engine and modified planner to implement the concept of SharedPlans. The developed agent will be deployed and evaluated with real patients and the therapeutic alliance will be measured using standard measurements. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",2019,,IVA 2019 - Proceedings of the 19th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents,,,248-251,,10.1145/3308532.3329413,,#5936,Abdulrahman 2019,,,0
Personality Traits and Business Intelligence: A Model to Improve Direct Selling Systems,"Tornillo, J.E.; Pascal, G.; Moguerza, J.M.; Redchuk, A.","Direct selling is a business model that presents opportunities for personal, professional and economic development for all those people who wish to obtain income through the generation of their own business, based on the formation of sales networks. For that reason, direct sellers have objectives that transcend the sales activities themselves, such as establishing sustainable interpersonal relationships with their clients in the medium and long term and being able to run their own business. In this work, we study personality traits and personal profiles of sellers who operate under this modality through the DISC test, studying the twelve main combinations. These results are subjected to statistical analysis and then incorporated into a business intelligence platform which contains traditional data such as sales, billing, personal data and seniority. The results, in the first place, validate those desirable traits for a traditional seller, referenced in the bibliography, such as kindness and persuasiveness. Nevertheless, this research highlight other personality traits that contribute to the success of the direct sellers and that are especially desirable for this business, for example, long-term reliability, self-motivation, proactivity and the ability to make decisions under pressure. The incorporation of this type of data supposes an added value for the management of direct selling businesses. Besides, the integration with business intelligence platform contributes to the efficiency of the information management. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"5th International Conference on Information Management, ICIM 2019",,,202-206,,10.1109/INFOMAN.2019.8714704,,#5937,Tornillo 2019,,,0
When people are problematically attached to social media: How would the design matter?,"Altuwairiqi, M.; Arden-Close, E.; Bolat, E.; Renshaw-Vuillier, L.; Ali, R.","Social technology, in particular, social media has increasingly become part of individual's life. People rely on social media interaction to relate with other people and satisfy their leisure or behavioural support purposes. Features such as those presented in the Honeycomb ecology, e.g. sharing, profiling and reputation, are used as means to that end. Recent designs of technology embed social features in them, enabling people to talk to the machine and interact with it as a sentient being, e.g. chatbot and robots, or use it as a mediator for social interaction, e.g. Social Internet of Things (SIoT). However, we argue that over-reliance on social media may result in a problematic attachment to it leading to a negative impact on users' wellbeing. We conduct a multi-stages study to explore the negative psychological states that social media features can trigger. We mainly employ diary studies trying to increase the ecological validity of our data. We also discuss the enrichment of social media with tools to aid people in staying in control of their attachment and the risks such tools can introduce to user experience as well as their behaviour change process. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"Conference Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",2019-October,,4211-4218,,10.1109/SMC.2019.8913856,,#5938,Altuwairiqi 2019,,,0
A Personalized Model for Driver Lane-Changing Behavior Prediction Using Deep Neural Network,"Gao, J.; Zhu, H.; Murphey, Y.L.","Lane changes are stressful maneuvers for drivers, particularly during high-speed traffic flows. Modeling driver's lane-changing decision and implementation process is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving behaviors. To address this issue, this paper presents a personalized Model, LCPM, for Lane-Changing Behavior Prediction based on the Root Residual Network (Root-ResNet) backbone from vehicle dynamics data and driver physiological data. Firstly, with abundant inputs of Root-ResNet, LCPM is able to exploit more local information from two differing modality data. Secondly, LCPM has an ability of using global information to selectively emphasise informative features and suppress less useful ones with a special regularization method, Weighted Channel Dropout (WCD). The experimental results show that the LCPM is capable of learning the latent features of lane-changing behaviors and achieving significantly better performance than other popular networks on a real-world driving dataset. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"2019 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Big Data, ICAIBD 2019",,,90-96,,10.1109/ICAIBD.2019.8837013,,#5939,Gao 2019,,,0
Anthropomorphic virtual assistant to support self-care of type 2 diabetes in older people: A perspective on the role of artificial intelligence,"Magyar, G.; Balsa, J.; Cláudio, A.P.; Carmo, M.B.; Neves, P.; Alves, P.; Félix, I.B.; Pimenta, N.; Guerreiro, M.P.","The global prevalence of diabetes is escalating. Attributable deaths and avoidable health costs related to diabetes represent a substantial burden and threaten the sustainability of contemporary healthcare systems. Information technologies are an encouraging avenue to tackle the challenge of diabetes management. Anthropomorphic virtual assistants designed as relational agents have demonstrated acceptability to older people and may promote long-term engagement. The VASelfCare project aims to develop and test a virtual assistant software prototype to facilitate the self-care of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present position paper describes key aspects of the VASelfCare prototype and discusses the potential use of artificial intelligence. Machine learning techniques represent promising approaches to provide a more personalised user experience with the prototype, by means of behaviour adaptation of the virtual assistant to users’ preferences or emotions or to develop chatbots. The effect of these sophisticated approaches on relevant endpoints, such as users’ engagement and motivation, needs to be established in comparison to less responsive options.

Towards a persuasive recommender for bike sharing systems: A defeasible argumentation approach,"Diez, C.; Palanca, J.; Sanchez-Anguix, V.; Heras, S.; Giret, A.; Julián, V.","This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users’ characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,,Energies,12,4,,,10.3390/en12040662,,#5941,Diez 2019,,,0

Belief in reasoning,"Sarbo, J.J.; Cozijn, R.","Reasoning has three types, deduction, induction, and abduction, of which we perceive deduction to be necessarily true, induction plausibly true, and abduction only hypothetically true. Syllogistic is a theory of deductive reasoning, introducing three figures of inferencing, of which figure-1 is obviously true, figure-3 and figure-2 are increasingly less transparent. We argue that the three figures of syllogistic and the three types of reasoning are related and their truth perceptions can be explained as different degrees of belief.

Sustained improvements in cancer care in recent years have resulted in increased numbers of people living with and beyond cancer, with increased attention being placed on improving quality of life for those individuals. Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. This paper provides an overview of important areas for the foundations of the creation of a new Connected Health paradigm in cancer care. Here we discuss the capabilities of mobile and wearable technologies; we also discuss pervasive and persuasive strategies and device systems to provide multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches for cancer patients for mental well-being, physical activity promotion, and rehabilitation. Several examples already show that there is enthusiasm in strengthening the possibilities offered by Connected Health in persuasive and pervasive technology in cancer care. Developments harnessing the Internet of Things, personalization, patient-centered design, and artificial intelligence help to monitor and assess the health status of cancer patients. Furthermore, this paper analyses the data infrastructure ecosystem for Connected Health and its semantic interoperability with the Connected Health economy ecosystem and its associated barriers. Interoperability is essential when developing Connected Health solutions that integrate with health systems and electronic health records. Given the exponential business growth of the Connected Health economy, there is an urgent need to develop mHealth (mobile health) exponentially, making it both an attractive and challenging market. In conclusion, there is a need for user-centered and multidisciplinary standards of practice to the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of Connected Health interventions in cancer care to ensure their acceptability, practicality, feasibility, effectiveness, affordability, safety, and equity. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Persuasion and Incentives Through the Lens of Duality,"Dughmi, S.; Niazadeh, R.; Psomas, A.; Weinberg, S.M.","Lagrangian duality underlies both classical and modern mechanism design. In particular, the dual perspective often permits simple and detail-free characterizations of optimal and approximately optimal mechanisms. This paper applies this same methodology to a close cousin of traditional mechanism design, one which shares conceptual and technical elements with its more mature relative: the burgeoning field of persuasion. The dual perspective permits us to analyze optimal persuasion schemes both in settings which have been analyzed in prior work, as well as for natural generalizations which we are the first to explore in depth. Most notably, we permit combining persuasion policies with payments, which serve to augment the persuasion power of the scheme.

First encounter with robot Alpha: How individual differences interact with vocal and kinetic cues in users’ social responses,"Xu, K.","The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm was proposed more than two decades ago to understand humans’ interaction with computer technologies. Today, as emerging technologies like social robots become more personal and persuasive, questions of how users respond to them socially, what individual factors leverage the relationship, and what constitutes the social influence of these technologies need to be addressed. A lab experiment was conducted to examine the interactions between individual differences and social robots’ vocal and kinetic cues. Results suggested that users developed more trust in a social robot with a human voice than with a synthetic voice. Users also developed more intimacy and interest in the social robot when it was paired with humanlike gestures. Moreover, individual differences including users’ gender, attitudes toward robots, and robot exposure affected their psychological responses.

Agent-based emotional persuasive cooperative subject selection model,"Jing-Hua, W.; Chen-Ying, X.; Fu-Juan, Z.","With the rapid development of the Internet and e-commerce, automatic negotiation has become a hot research topic. Due to its unique intelligence and interaction, agent can realize complex negotiation and has great advantages in the field of automatic negotiation. Agent-based debate negotiation can send information other than the proposal by making the negotiation more efficient. Persuasion debates consider more persuasion factors and make the negotiation process more rational. In order to adapt to the development of artificial intelligence efficiently, the emotion is introduced into the field of agent persuasion, which makes the agent's behavior more in line with human thinking and better simulates human emotional decisions. In consequence, the negotiation results are easier to understand and interpret. At this moment, agent has not only emotional ability, but also logical computing ability, which improves agent's adaptability in dynamic and complex environments, and achieves the goal of automatic negotiation effectively. In related research, different scholars and experts have studied agent-based persuasion and agent-based emotion from different perspectives. However, the following problems exist. First, the research on emotion is not comprehensive, especially the quantification of emotion. Second, the current research about the application of emotional theory in the agent persuasive field is not enough. Third, most of agent persuasion study is about interaction mechanism, and there is little research on the choice of cooperative subjects, especially the selection of cooperative subjects considering emotional factor. In the study of the selection of cooperative subjects, the selection model is more important, and the construction of the model is based on an effective cooperative subject evaluation model. Therefore, aiming at the shortcomings of the existing research, we classify the emotion-based emotion persuasion based on agent. According to the classification, we propose a corresponding formal model of emotion generation, and combine the first law of emotion intensity of psychology to quantify the emotion of agent. The agent's emotion intensity calculation method is proposed. Secondly, the evaluation of agent-based emotional persuasion is summarized as the evaluation of the agent's proposal and reliability. Subsequently, the multi-attribute utility function is used to establish the corresponding agent's proposal evaluation model, and the fuzzy membership function is used to establish the corresponding agent's reliability evaluation model. On the basis of the above two evaluation models, emotion is used as a new evaluation factor to establish an evaluation model of the subject's emotions. Three evaluation models are put forward comprehensively to construct a corresponding Agent-based emotional persuasive cooperation subject selection model. To illustrate the effectiveness of the above model, an example was designed and simulated. The simulation results show that emotion in emotional persuasion has an important influence on the choice of cooperative subjects. Among them, positive emotion enhances the comprehensive evaluation value in emotional persuasion and negative emotion weakens the comprehensive evaluation value. In the end, due to the influence of emotion, there are obvious differences between comprehensive evaluation values, which can significantly affect the ultimate selection of cooperative subjects. Based on this, the rationality and effectiveness of the model are verified. At the same time, it also illustrates the important influence of emotion on agent-based persuasiveness © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.",2019,,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management,33,1,230-237,,10.13587/j.cnki.jieem.2019.01.024,,#5951,Jing-Hua 2019,,,0
Reinforcing the attitude-behavior relationship in persuasive game design: Four design recommendations for persuasive games for societal interventions,"Erdbrink, A.; Kortmann, R.; Verbraeck, A.","Persuasive games for societal interventions aim to shape, reinforce or change players’ attitudes and behavior to help solving complex societal issues. In earlier work, we explored how persuasive game mechanics may contribute to the formation of attitudes in persuasive games. As a follow-up, this paper presents four design recommendations that could increase the chance that these attitudes will actually lead to the desired behavior shown by players after the game: viz., these attitudes require the right conditions to become a predictor of the desired, post-game behavior. In order to arrive at these recommendations we looked at relevant work from the field of social psychology. Next we linked our insights to the context of persuasive game design. This yielded four conceptual design recommendations for maximizing the likelihood for an attitude influenced by a persuasive game to result in the desired behavior in the real world; 1. aligning the degree of specification of a game’s message and the desired behavior 2. emphasizing the function of the attitude to be influenced 3. enabling players to reflect on their internal states 4. emphasizing personal relevance of an attitude to a behavioral choice So far, these recommendations are still theoretical in nature. We therefore discuss how future work should empirically examine these, including their implications for the effective use of persuasive game mechanics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11899 LNCS,,83-91,,10.1007/978-3-030-34350-7_9,,#5953,Erdbrink 2019,,,0
"Driving evaluation based on acceleration, speed and road signs","Gota, D.-I.; Fanca, A.; Puscasiu, A.; Valean, H.; Miclea, L.","New technologies are emerging in all fields of science. Being the case of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), these new technologies are affecting all fields of science, weather improving them or helping the end user into extracting new data, or analyzing data coming from these fields. One of the main focus area of IoT is on the Automotive side. The connected cars, self-driving cars, have been developed using the IoT concepts. New functionalities such as Semi-automatic selfdriving, finding of parking spaces, automatic self-parking vehicles, sending of data to servers via special services, all have been done with the help of IoT. The paper presents a new way of evaluating the car drivers based on data related to speed, acceleration, combined with the existing road signs. The end results will not only bring enhancement into the driving abilities, but also will bring great value to the maintenance of the vehicle and to the overall safety of the driving process. To obtain a better solution the system makes use of 3 algorithms for determining acceleration, breaking, speeding and lane changing behavior of the driver. By using IoT we aim to correct reckless driving, determine the causes of a defect, all based on statistical data collected over a period of time. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"2019 23rd International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing, ICSTCC 2019 - Proceedings",,,554-559,,10.1109/ICSTCC.2019.8885678,,#5954,Gota 2019,,,0
Behavioral modeling in weight loss interventions,"Aswani, A.; Kaminsky, P.; Mintz, Y.; Flowers, E.; Fukuoka, Y.","Designing systems with human agents is difficult because it often requires models that characterize agents’ responses to changes in the system's states and inputs. An example of this scenario occurs when designing treatments for obesity. While weight loss interventions through increasing physical activity and modifying diet have found success in reducing individuals’ weight, such programs are difficult to maintain over long periods of time due to lack of patient adherence. A promising approach to increase adherence is through the personalization of treatments to each patient. In this paper, we make a contribution toward treatment personalization by developing a framework for predictive modeling using utility functions that depend upon both time-varying system states and motivational states evolving according to some modeled process corresponding to qualitative social science models of behavior change. Computing the predictive model requires solving a bilevel program, which we reformulate as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This reformulation provides the first (to our knowledge) formulation for Bayesian inference that uses empirical histograms as prior distributions. We study the predictive ability of our framework using a data set from a weight loss intervention, and our predictive model is validated by comparison to standard machine learning approaches. We conclude by describing how our predictive model could be used for optimization, unlike standard machine learning approaches that cannot. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",2019,,European Journal of Operational Research,272,3,1058-1072,,10.1016/j.ejor.2018.07.011,,#5955,Aswani 2019,,,0
Experiences from using gamification and IoT-based educational tools in high schools towards energy savings,"Paganelli, F.; Mylonas, G.; Cuffaro, G.; Nesi, I.","Raising awareness among young people, and especially students, on the relevance of behavior change for achieving energy savings is increasingly being considered as a key enabler towards long-term and cost-effective energy efficiency policies. However, the way to successfully apply educational interventions focused on such targets inside schools is still an open question. In this paper, we present our approach for enabling IoT-based energy savings and sustainability awareness lectures and promoting data-driven energy-saving behaviors focused on a high school audience. We present our experiences toward the successful application of sets of educational tools and software over a real-world Internet of Things (IoT) deployment.

Applying psychology of persuasion to conversational agents through reinforcement learning: An exploratory study,"Massimo, F.D.; Carfora, V.; Catellani, P.; Piastra, M.","This study is set in the framework of task-oriented conversational agents in which dialogue management is obtained via Reinforcement Learning. The aim is to explore the possibility to overcome the typical end-to-end training approach through the integration of a quantitative model developed in the field of persuasion psychology. Such integration is expected to accelerate the training phase and improve the quality of the dialogue obtained. In this way, the resulting agent would take advantage of some subtle psychological aspects of the interaction that would be difficult to elicit via end-to-end training. We propose a theoretical architecture in which the psychological model above is translated into a probabilistic predictor and then integrated in the reinforcement learning process, intended in its partially observable variant. The experimental validation of the architecture proposed is currently ongoing. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.",2019,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2481,,,,,,#5957,Massimo 2019,,,0
EHealth Initiatives for the Promotion of Healthy Lifestyle and Allied Implementation Difficulties,"Chatterjee, A.; Gerdes, M.W.; Martinez, S.","Research in eHealth has opened a new dimension to improve personal healthcare with the help of information and communication technologies (ICT). eHealth is an 'umbrella term' for the use of ICT for health. Remote care-giving technologies (mHealth, Telehealth, Telemedicine) are an extended branch of eHealth initiatives. The concept of health e-Coaching is another promising initiative of eHealth research for real-Time personalized lifestyle support. The focus of eHealth initiatives is to deliver high quality, evidence-based, secure, cost-effective, timely care to support people for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. However, the practical implementation of different eHealth initiatives has often been challenging to establish prophesied benefit. Health monitoring and fitness coaching with artificial intelligence will rule the coming decades. The pillars of e-Coaching initiatives are data collection, analysis of data, recommendation (sending the right message to the right people in the right context) and data security. An optimized system for health e-Coaching, management of a huge amount of health data, ensuring data protection are some big challenges to the eHealth researchers. Prediction of human psychology for effective e-Coaching recommendation is another level of difficulty to overcome as human behavior is constantly changing. Different eHealth initiatives for the promotion of healthy lifestyle and its implementation difficulties have been our primary focus of the review in this paper. This paper is a result of our early stage research related to 'Health e-Coaching recommendation system generation'. This paper will help young eHealth researchers to have a holistic idea on different eHealth technologies, initiatives till date for the promotion of healthy lifestyle and associated implementation challenges to overcome in the future. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications",2019-October,,Jul-14,,10.1109/WiMOB.2019.8923324,,#5958,Chatterjee 2019,,,0
Engaging bystanders using persuasive technology: A meta-analysis of influencing factors on moral courage,"Röderer, K.; Himmelsbach, J.; Schwarz, S.; Tscheligi, M.","Interventions in emergency situations with an aggressor are characterized by potentially high costs but no or very little direct reward for an intervening person. In such moral courage situations, the willingness to act is critical for the safety and well-being of others. Persuasive technology has a high potential for changing attitudes and behavior and thus, supporting such a behavior for the greater good. Aiming at identifying promising persuasive strategies, a meta-analysis to identify factors relevant for moral courage was conducted. Findings highlight seven attitude and competence factors with high potential for attitude and behavior change towards morally courageous behavior.

Text optimization using interactive evolutionary computation techniques,"Madera, Q.; Garcia, M.; Castillo, O.","The description of a product or an ad's text can be rewritten in many ways if other text fragments which are similar in meaning substitute different words or phrases. A good selection of words or phrases, composing an ad, is very important for the creation of a good advertisement text, as the meaning of the text depends on this and it affects in a positive or a negative way the interest of the possible consumers towards the advertised product. In this paper we present a method for the optimization of advertisement texts through the use of interactive evolutionary computing techniques and fuzzy logic. The use of Fuzzy Logic enables to manage the uncertainty in the process of evolution.

Engaging the audience with biased news: An exploratory study on prejudice and engagement,"Ciancone Chama, A.G.; Monaro, M.; Piccoli, E.; Gamberini, L.; Spagnolli, A.","The persuasiveness of a narrative is increased by the audience’s engagement with it, which in turn depends on the extent to which its needs and goals are served by the narrative. This study considers whether indulging the audience’s prejudice might be a way to serve their needs and increase engagement. Two different versions of a news videoclip, one neutral and one prejudiced, were displayed in a between-participants design (N = 44). The participants’ familiarity with the topic and prejudice against it were measured, and their effect on the engagement with the two types of video was tested. The analysis shows an indifference for biased content, equally engaging than nonbiased; they also show an effect of familiarity.

Cross-lingual low-resource set-to-description retrieval for global e-commerce,"Li, J.; Liu, C.; Wang, J.; Bing, L.; Li, H.; Liu, X.; Zhao, D.; Yan, R.","With the prosperous of cross-border e-commerce, there is an urgent demand for designing intelligent approaches for assisting e-commerce sellers to offer local products for consumers from all over the world. In this paper, we explore a new task of cross-lingual information retrieval, i.e., cross-lingual set-to-description retrieval in cross-border e-commerce, which involves matching product attribute sets in the source language with persuasive product descriptions in the target language. We manually collect a new and high-quality paired dataset, where each pair contains an unordered product attribute set in the source language and an informative product description in the target language. As the dataset construction process is both time-consuming and costly, the new dataset only comprises of 13.5k pairs, which is a low-resource setting and can be viewed as a challenging testbed for model development and evaluation in cross-border e-commerce. To tackle this cross-lingual set-to-description retrieval task, we propose a novel cross-lingual matching network (CLMN) with the enhancement of context-dependent cross-lingual mapping upon the pre-trained monolingual BERT representations. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CLMN yields impressive results on the challenging task and the context-dependent cross-lingual mapping on BERT yields noticeable improvement over the pre-trained multi-lingual BERT model.

Usable mobile app for community education on colorectal cancer: Development process and usability study,"Mohamad Marzuki, M.F.; Yaacob, N.A.; Majdi bin Yaacob, N.; Abu Hassan, M.R.; Ahmad, S.B.","Background: Participation in colorectal cancer screening is still low among Malaysians despite the increasing trend of incidence, with more than half of the new cases being detected in the advanced stages. Knowledge improvement might increase screening participation and thus improve the chances of disease detection. With the advancement of communication technology, people nowadays prefer to read from their mobile phone using a Web browser or mobile apps compared with the traditional printed material. Therefore, health education and promotion should adapt this behavior change in educating the community. Objective: This study aimed to document the process of designing and developing a mobile app for community education on colorectal cancer and assess the usability of the prototype. Methods: The nominal group technique (NGT) was used for the content development of the mobile app. NGT involving community educationists and clinicians combined with community representatives as the target users identified relevant health information and communication strategies including features for a user-friendly mobile app. The prototype was developed using framework Ionic 1, based on the Apache Cordova and Angular JS (Google). It was published in the Google Play store. In total, 50 mobile phone users aged 50 years and above and who had never been diagnosed with any type of cancer were invited to download and use the app. They were asked to assess the usability of the app using the validated Malay version of System Usability Scale Questionnaire for the Assessment of Mobile Apps questionnaire. The One-sample t test was used to assess the usability score with a cut-off value of 68 for the usable mobile app. Results: The Colorectal Cancer Awareness Application (ColorApp) was successfully developed in the local Malay language. The NGT discussion had suggested 6 main menus in the ColorApp prototype, which are Introduction, Sign and Symptoms, Risk Factors, Preventive Measures, Colorectal Cancer Screening Program, and immunochemical fecal occult blood test kit. A total of 2 additional artificial intelligence properties menus were added to allow user-ColorApp interaction: Analyze Your Status and ColorApp Calculator.

Decision making simulation of autonomous driving combined with state machine and dynamic target path,"Fan, X.; He, W.; Zhang, Z.","Objective Driverless technology is an essential part of intelligent transportation systems, such as environmental information perception, intelligent planning, and multilevel auxiliary driving. This technology reduces driver's work inten- sification and prevents accidents. With the development of artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles have attracted con- siderable attention in the industry and academia in recent years. In addition, a decision-making system is a core research of driverless technology. The reduction on the number of road accidents is of paramount societal importance, and increasing research efforts have been devoted to decision-making systems within the past few years. Conducting human-like decisions with other encountered vehicles in complex traffic scenarios causes great challenges to autonomous vehicles. The research on autonomous driving decision systems has important theoretical and practical values to improve the level of intelligent vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. However, the current decision-making system has several limitations, such as unrea- sonable logic, large computational complexity, and limited application scene, due to the uncertainty and randomness of the driving behavior of surrounding vehicles. To solve these problems, this study constructs a finite-state machine-based deci- sion-making system for the safety driving of autonomous vehicles in dynamic urban traffic environments. This study mainly investigates the passage of vehicles through intersections and their changing of lanes, which are the core issues of decision-making systems. Method The driver's behavior at a certain period of time is determined based on the current traffic condi- tion and risk perception. We define the primary state of the vehicle based on the driving range of the autonomous vehicle, such as driving at the intersection, driving in the driveway, and approaching the crossroads. Each primary state includes many secondary states. For example, a vehicle at crossroads may turn or keep straight. Combined with the original finite- state machine theory, a suitable traffic state machine (TSM) for intelligent systems is proposed. Considering the complexity and diversity of traffic environment, a dynamic target path (DTP) algorithm is proposed to improve the feasibility of the decision system. Combined with the TSM and DTP algorithm, we propose a DTP model based on finite-state machine for the decision system and analyze the importance of the model. For complex and diverse traffic environment, intelligent vehicles only focus on their own driving information and ignore the state of other vehicles, which cause considerable risks. Thus, we divide the awareness and conflict areas for each autonomous vehicle. The perceived range of autonomous vehicles at the crossroads is defined as the awareness area, and the reachable range of autonomous vehicles is called the conflict area. The perception area of vehicles in the driveway is defined as the consciousness area, and the range of interaction between auton- omous and surrounding vehicles is defined as the conflict area. A reasonable decision can effectively reduce the probability of accidents in conflict areas. We use the DTP algorithm to calculate the risk of decision making in restricting vehicle behavior. A fixed follow-up distance cannot consider the influence of speed. Thus, this study proposes a dynamic critical follow-up distance, which reduces the collision with preceding vehicle while following the vehicle. Furthermore, a full velocity difference model is used to avoid collision with the front vehicle of the target lane during lane change under different scenarios. Results We repeatedly perform experiments in different scenarios through the Unity 3D engine to verify the effec- tiveness of the model and algorithm. In the first experiment, we simulate a scene of an autonomous vehicle driven at a crossroad. The second experiment simulates the responses of autonomous vehicles to emergencies. The third experiment simulates the changing of lanes of autonomous vehicles in reaching their destinations. The fourth experiment simulates the changing of lanes of autonomous vehicles in increasing their speed. We simulate the lane changing behavior of autonomous vehicles during foggy days to verify that the experimental results are unaffected by poor weather conditions. Experiments show that autonomous vehicles not only can meet the driving expectation but also ensure driving safety during poor weather conditions. Experimental results show that the driving intentions of other vehicles can be obtained and autonomous vehicles can make correct decisions based on the potential risk of intersection and current traffic environment. Autonomous vehicles can change lanes based on their driving demand when driving on the driveway. In case of emergencies, the autonomous vehicle considers the special vehicle as a dynamic obstacle. After yielding the right-of-way to emergency vehicles, the autonomous vehicle returns to the original lane to continue driving. To prove that the proposed method can improve the traf fic flow efficiency, the proposed model is compared with other models. Results demonstrate that the difference among the three models is uncertain when the vehicle density is small. However, the average speed of the model is increased at most by 32 km/h and 22 km/h when the vehicle density is greater than 0. 2 and less than 0.5, respectively. The success rate of lane changing in this model is approximately increased at most by 37 percentage points and 25 percentage points when the density of vehicles is less than 0.65, respectively. Conclusions The proposed algorithm not only improves the safety and accuracy of decision making in dynamic urban traffic environment but also helps improve traffic flow saturation and reduces traffic flow. In addition, various traffic environments can be modeled by our simulation framework. Although the proposed model and algorithm are relatively simple, the assessment of potential risks can meet the planning time of autonomous driv ing. Our work provides the rules for the decision making in autonomous driving and several references for the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, the influence of vehicle types, trajectory, and road width on decision making are ignored. In the future, we will improve the current work and provide a complete and reasonable framework for automatic driving decision systems. © 2019 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

Do ethics matter in persuasive technology?,"Kight, R.; Gram-Hansen, S.B.","This paper aims to discuss how ethics has been addressed within the persuasive technology field and to explore whether ethics is generally applied in persuasive technology (PT) or simply recognized by academics as an important perspective. The paper is based on a literature review of the past 13 years of Persuasive Technology conference papers. The themes identified from the literature review are presented along with summaries of defining works within the field which have contributed to the discussion of ethics. This is followed by a discussion and reflection on the findings of the literature review. Finally, we conclude that ethics does matter but we argue that ethics has not been adequately addressed in the field of PT and that ethical considerations regarding the rights of the designers need to be researched. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11433 LNCS,,143-155,,10.1007/978-3-030-17287-9_12,,#5979,Kight 2019,,,0
AI-supported health coaching model for patients with chronic diseases,"Sqalli, M.T.; Al-Thani, D.","The global expenditure of healthcare systems on the management of chronic diseases is exhausting costs and efforts. This is due to the delicate nature of patients needing care constantly, as well as the chronic nature of the diseases. These two causes force patients to pay visits to their healthcare providers more frequently. Repetitive visits are countless, short in time, unmanageable and ineffective. The state of the art for managing chronic diseases focus on a shared effort between the patient and the physician in an ongoing process of collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and finally adapting the management program by the physician and the patient. Technology along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) made these processes easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to introduce models that integrated AI in health coaching plans for patients with chronic diseases. As health coaching is an integral part of some countries public health strategy. It is now used as a complementary medical intervention to shape healthy behavior change. In this paper we propose a model that puts health coaching along with AI in its core to 1. empower patients to effectively manage their chronic conditions 2. as well as to persuade them to adhere to their care management program for extended periods of time. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,Proceedings of the International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems,2019-August,,452-456,,10.1109/ISWCS.2019.8877113,,#5980,Sqalli 2019,,,0

"Use of artificial intelligence to measure gas flow rate, Bongkot asset","Ketmalee, T.; Sirisawadwattana, J.; Piyajunya, T.; Ngamkamollert, K.; Bandyopadhyay, P.; Whangkitjamorn, J.","Greater Bongkot North is a gas field located in Gulf of Thailand and on production since 1993. Most of the old wellhead platforms (30%) lack remote well test facilities which requires personnel visits for any well test measurement. Often, well testing in these platforms get lower priority compared to other operations in a matured field. This project implemented artificial intelligent (AI) technique to estimate gas rate from other available engineering and geological parameters. A new approach using machine learning was applied to estimate gas production rate where actual measurements are not available. Actual production well test data was used to train the model. Input parameters used were: 1. Surface facility information 2. Fluid properties 3. Production condition 4. Geological setup A blind test on the subset of historical data showed a level of confidence (R2) value of 0.93. This provided confidence to proceed with a full field pilot. A pilot was conducted during January to May 2018. The area of pilot was spread across various geological, operating and surface condition setups to reduce sampling bias. The pilot demonstrated the following use cases: 1. Improved prediction accuracy in wells with no recent test, achieving primary object of model. 2. Detection of well behavior changes: The model could detect changes in well behavior without human intervention much before the trends become obvious for engineers to detect. 3. Improved potential estimation in wells with leaks in wellhead chokes where conventional analysis followed in Bongkot is not possible due to improper wellhead shut-in pressure measurement. 4. Improved efficiency with production allocation: The conventional method requires significant time (40-80 person hours per month) to make the data available for production allocation. This can be shortened significantly by use of this method In essence, this project demonstrated the potential use of artificial intelligent to improve efficiency in a matured gas field operating under marginal conditions. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",2019,,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2019, ADIP 2019",,,,,10.2118/197454-ms,,#5982,Ketmalee 2019,,,0

Impact of social media advertising on consumer’s health,"Pabalkar, V.; Chanda, R.; Tayal, P.; Singh, R.","If the message on the social media message isn’t clear and focused, it’s unlikely to be effective, resulting in wastage of time and resources. This leads to failure of the advertisement. This leaves an impact on the health dimensions of a customer. An ideal social media message must convey the message to the audience about the product and should not give an impression to one that it is an overtly like advertising. As per Global Digital report, 2019, the number of internet users worldwide in 2019 is 4.388 billion, up 9.1% year-on-year. The number of social media users worldwide in 2019 is 3.484 billion, up 9% year-on-year. The number of mobile phone users in 2019 is 5.112 billion, up 2% year-on-year. 40% of people read and refer to articles on social media platforms to procure information on how does a patient cope up with the chronic conditions when affected with a disease.(Health Care Finance News)1 More than 1,500 hospitals across the country have their presence online. The popular social media sites used by them include Facebook and Linkedin. (WHPRMS-Wisconsin Healthcare Public Relations & Marketing Society. Wisconsin)2 Social media users are in a state where there is plethora of information on various topics. With the rise of social media platforms there has been an increasing need for research in this field as it creates more platforms for the marketers but it also faces challenges of creating unnecessary noise which leads to avoidance behaviour on the consumer’s part. In this study an attempt is made to understand the different noise creating factors such as irrelevant content, cluttered content, no emotional connect, excessive advertising etcetera to find out what exactly drives the customer to avoid a product or brand. The purpose of this study is to measure and evaluate the ways in which a consumers buying behaviour changes due to the noise created by advertisements and find prominent factors which cause such behaviour. The key observations from the study state that when a particular advertisement is placed repetitively in different platforms the customer tends to ignore the ad and subconsciously ignore the brand or product. When an Advertisement is too cluttered, customer might miss the actual part of the ad and the visual appeal also drops due to clutter. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

The experiment was conducted for nine days under three conditions; nothing projected, projecting a circular light, and projecting a magic circle. We observed the behavior of pedestrians and found that the magic circle had no effect on changing the direction of movement, but it did have an effect on path; pedestrians avoided the projected circle, though not the circular light. Using the idea of semiotics, we concluded that the behavioral changes could have been caused by pedestrians' interpretations of the message of the magic circle. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"Proceedings - 2019 International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence, TAAI 2019",,,,,10.1109/TAAI48200.2019.8959864,,#5988,Tsubaki 2019,,,0

Patient-centric structural determinants of adherence rates among asthma populations: Exploring the potential of patient activation and encouragement tool TRUSTR to improve adherence,"Zia, A.; Brassart, A.; Thomas, S.; Ye, F.; Stephenson, J.J.; Daniel Mullins, C.; Jones, C.A.","Background: Lack of adherence with prescribed medications among the asthma populations exacerbates health outcomes and increases social and economic costs. Objectives: The proposed study aims to model patient-centric structural determinants of adherence rates among asthma patients and explore the potential of mobile health apps such as the TRUSTR platform to improve adherence using its power of monetary and non-monetary chatbotting and non-monetary nudges. Following specific hypotheses are tested: (1) Patient attributes, such as their age and medical condition, have significant effect on their adherence with the prescribed treatment plans. (2) Behavioral nudging with rewards and engagement via mobile health apps will increase adherence rates. Methods: The patient population (N = 37 359) consists of commercially insured patients with asthma who have been identified from administrative claims in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019. Two Structural Equation Models (SEMs) are estimated to quantify direct, indirect, and total effect sizes of age and medical condition on proportion of days covered (PDC) and medical possession ratio (MPR), mediated by patient medical and pharmacy visits. Fourteen additional SEMs were estimated to lateralize TRUSTR findings and conduct sensitivity analysis. Results: HIRD data reveal mean adherence rate of 59% (standard deviation (SD) 29%) for PDC and 58% for MPR (SD 36%). Key structural findings from SEMs derived from the HIRD dataset indicate that each additional year in the age of the patient has a positive total effect on the adherence rate. Patients with poor medical condition are likely to have lower adherence rate, but this direct effect is countered by mediating variables. Further, each additional reward and higher engagement with a mobile app is likely to have a positive total effect on increasing the adherence rate. Conclusions: HIRD data reveal mean adherence rate of 59% (SD 29%), providing the evidence for the opportunity to increase adherence rate by around 40%. Statistical modeling results reveal structural determinants, such as the opportunity to nudge, are higher among younger patients, as they have higher probability of being non-adherent. Methodologically, lateralization approach demonstrates the potential to capture real-world evidence beyond clinical data and merge it with clinical data. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

Medical ethics considerations on artificial intelligence,"Keskinbora, K.H.","Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently one of the mostly controversial matters of the world. This article discusses AI in terms of the medical ethics issues involved, both existing and potential. Once artificial intelligence is fully developed within electronic systems, it will afford many useful applications in many sectors ranging from banking, agriculture, medical procedures to military operations, especially by decreasing the involvement of humans in critically dangerous activities. Robots as well as computers themselves are embodiments of values inasmuch as they entail actions and choices, but their practical applications are modelled or programmed by the engineers building the systems. AI will need algorithmic procedures to ensure safety in the implementation of such systems. The AI algorithms written could naturally contain errors that may result in unforeseen consequences and unfair outcomes along economic and racial class lines. It is crucial that measures be taken to monitor technological developments ensuring preventative and precautionary safeguards are in place to safeguard the rights of those involved against direct or indirect coercion. While it is the responsibility of AI researchers to ensure that the future impact is more positive than negative, ethicists and philosophers need to be deeply involved in the development of such technologies from the beginning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Journal of Clinical Neuroscience,64,,277-282,,10.1016/j.jocn.2019.03.001,,#5991,Keskinbora 2019,,,0
"Imagination, creativity and spirituality in psychotherapy: Welcome to wonderland","Domash, L.","The aim of this book is to awaken creative desire and expand the imagination of the psychotherapist and, in turn, her patient. Each chapter is meant to surprise the reader and help him see the world in a new way. Many varieties of imagination are explored -- the spiritual, the relational, the dreamworld, the aesthetic and the adaptive. The author offers space to reflect, to daydream, to remember; space to pursue goals, to make new connections; space to take risks and space to be wrong. The psychotherapist is encouraged to find her own voice, be poetic, dare to create, converse with other disciplines and, most especially, enter the world of dreams. This is all passed onto the patient as the dyad enters the intersubjective field. Both scholarly and practical, this volume elegantly and persuasively synthesizes for the first time research in many fields, including spirituality and Kabbalah, neuroscience, the arts, biology and artificial intelligence, to give an in depth and original understanding of the current pressing problems in the rapidly changing field of psychotherapy: how do we work with unconscious processes and early memories to help our patients become more imaginative, creative, hopeful and resilient, and in so doing, heal. The relationship between the body and creative imagination is fully explored as well as the disruptive effect of trauma on the imagination and how to address this. The emphasis on surprise, uncanny communication, interdisciplinary inquiry, use of dreamwork and the imagination of the body - how it spontaneously meets new challenges- all stimulate the creativity of the reader. Through numerous case studies, the author illustrates the practical implications of how this exploration allows for deeper understanding and more effective treatment. With the innovative synthesis and specific techniques the author provides, the clinician has tools to carry on the work of moving the field of psychotherapy forward as well as work ever more effectively with patients. © 2021 Leanne Domash.",2020,,"Imagination, Creativity and Spirituality in Psychotherapy: Welcome to Wonderland",,,1-187,,10.4324/9780429299148,,#5992,Domash 2020,,,0

Knowledge Complacency and Decision Support Systems,"Rodriguez, S.S.; Schaffer, J.A.; O'Donovan, J.; Höllerer, T.","Decision support systems (DSS), which are often based on complex statistical, machine learning, and AI models, have increasingly become a core part of data analytics and sensemaking processes. Automation complacency - a state characterized by over-trust in intelligent systems - has the potential to result in catastrophic performance failure.

In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of two studies of users interacting with decision aids to understand how knowledge retention is affected by the competence and presentation of a DSS. Our results indicate that while humans have the opportunity to learn and internalize domain concepts while being supported by a DSS, features that make the DSS appear more competent, persuasive, or customizable may lead a user to form incorrect beliefs about a domain. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"Proceedings - 2019 IEEE Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management, CogSIMA 2019",,,43-51,,10.1109/COGSIMA.2019.8724175,,#5995,Rodriguez 2019,,,0
"Strategic opportunities for leveraging low-cos t, high-impact technolo gical innovations to promote cardiovascular health in India","Prabhakaran, D.; Ajay, V.S.; Tandon, N.","Accelerated epidemiological transition in India over the last 40 years has resulted in a dramatic increase in the burden of cardiovascular diseases and the related risk factors of diabetes and hypertension. This increase in disease burden has been accompanied by pervasive health disparities associated with low disease detection rates, inadequate awareness, poor use of evidence-based interventions, and low adherence rates among patients in rural regions in India and those with low socioeconomic status. Several research groups in India have developed innovative technologies and care-delivery models for screening, diagnosis, clinical management, remote-monitoring, self-management, and rehabilitation for a range of chronic conditions. These innovations can leverage advances in sensor technology, genomic tools, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, and so on, for improving access to and delivering quality and affordable personalized medicine in primary care. In addition, several health technology start-ups are entering this booming market that is set to grow rapidly. Innovations outside biomedical space (eg, protection of traditional wisdom in diet, lifestyle, yoga) are equally important and are part of a comprehensive solution. Such low-cost, culturally tailored, robust innovations to promote health and reduce disparities require partnership among multi-sectors including academia, industry, civil society, and health systems operating in a conducive policy environment that fosters adequate public and private investments. In this article, we present the unique opportunity for India to use culturally tailored, low-cost, high-impact technological innovations and strategies to ameliorate the perennial challenges of social, policy, and environmental challenges including poverty, low educational attainment, culture, and other socioeconomic factors to promote cardiovascular health and advance health equity. © 2019 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

Delegated updates in epistemic graphs for opponent modelling,"Hunter, A.; Polberg, S.; Potyka, N.","In an epistemic graph, belief in arguments is represented by probability distributions. Furthermore, the influence that belief in arguments can have on the belief in other arguments is represented by constraints on the probability distributions. Different agents may choose different constraints to describe their reasoning, thus making epistemic graphs extremely flexible tools. A key application for epistemic graphs is modelling participants in persuasion dialogues, with the aim of modelling the change in beliefs as each move in the dialogue is made. This requires mechanisms for updating the model throughout the dialogue. In this paper, we introduce the class of delegated update methods, which harness existing, simpler update methods in order to produce more realistic outputs. In particular, we focus on hypothesized updates, which capture agent's reluctance or susceptibility to belief updates that can be caused by certain factors, such as time of the day, fatigue, dialogue length, and more.

This paper explores a method of improving the delivery process of push-notifications by extracting scrutable persuasive features and refining prediction of notification outcomes. Additionally, a method is proposed for generating recommended notifications, based on the extracted persuasive features, to maximise potential engagement for scenarios such as behavioural interventions. The results illustrate that the persuasive features extracted contributed toward improved push-notification action prediction and that the personalised persuasive notifications recommended vastly increased the Click Through Rate (CTR) of notifications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11433 LNCS,,67-73,,10.1007/978-3-030-17287-9_6,,#5998,Fraser 2019,,,0
Generating persuasive visual storylines for promotional videos,"Liu, C.; Dong, Y.; Yu, H.; Shen, Z.; Cui, L.; Gao, Z.; Wang, P.; Zhang, C.; Ren, P.; Xie, X.; Miao, C.","Video contents have become a critical tool for promoting products in E-commerce. However, the lack of automatic promotional video generation solutions makes large-scale video-based promotion campaigns infeasible. The first step of automatically producing promotional videos is to generate visual storylines, which is to select the building block footage and place them in an appropriate order. This task is related to the subjective viewing experience. It is hitherto performed by human experts and thus, hard to scale. To address this problem, we propose WundtBackpack, an algorithmic approach to generate storylines based on available visual materials, which can be video clips or images. It consists of two main parts, 1) the Learnable Wundt Curve to evaluate the perceived persuasiveness based on the stimulus intensity of a sequence of visual materials, which only requires a small volume of data to train; and 2) a clustering-based backpacking algorithm to generate persuasive sequences of visual materials while considering video length constraints. In this way, the proposed approach provides a dynamic structure to empower artificial intelligence (AI) to organize video footage in order to construct a sequence of visual stimuli with persuasive power. Extensive real-world experiments show that our approach achieves close to 10% higher perceived persuasiveness scores by human testers, and 12.5% higher expected revenue compared to the best performing state-of-the-art approach. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",2019,,"International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, Proceedings",,,901-910,,10.1145/3357384.3357906,,#5999,Liu 2019,,,0
The Gamer Types of Seniors and Gamification Strategies Toward Physical Activity,"Kuo, C.-M.; Chen, H.-J.","Gamification strategies were utilized as persuasive designs for promoting physical activities in recent years. However, the “one-size-fits-all” design approach cannot be employed effectively to convince all users to engage in targeted behaviors. Consequently, personalized gamified interactions which require an adaptation of gameful experiences to the user’s preferences were applied to drive users more effectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the gamer types among the seniors, and which gamification strategies are affected by the same gamer types, thereby engaging in more physical activities. We conducted an online questionnaire to investigate the gamer types of seniors. Based on the results, seniors can be divided into three categories of gamers: Easygoing, Socializer and Achiever. For the Easygoing, they showed little preference for gamification strategies and were more difficult to drive by specific strategies. The Socializer tends to be driven by socially oriented gamification strategies, but disliked punishment in games. Furthermore, the Achiever preferred to pursue personal achievements rather than interacting with others in games. The findings of this study contribute to HCI Community with the preliminary investigations on the gamer types of seniors, arriving at a better understanding of how persuasive technology can be designed to meet the needs of seniors. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11593 LNCS,,177-188,,10.1007/978-3-030-22015-0_14,,#6000,Kuo 2019,,,0
Checking it twice: Does adding spelling and grammar checkers improve essay quality in an automated writing tutor?,"McCarthy, K.S.; Roscoe, R.D.; Likens, A.D.; McNamara, D.S.","This study investigated the effect of incorporating spelling and grammar checking tools within an automated writing tutoring system, Writing Pal. High school students (n = 119) wrote and revised six persuasive essays. After initial drafts, all students received formative feedback about writing strategies. Half of the participants were also given access to spelling and grammar checking tools during the writing and revision periods. Linear mixed effects models revealed that essay quality for students in both conditions improved from initial draft to revision in terms of all aspects except essay unity. The availability of spelling and grammar checking yielded added improvements from initial draft to revision for several aspects of essay quality (i.e., conclusion, organization, voice, grammar/mechanics, and word choice), but other aspects were unaffected (i.e., introduction, body, unity, and sentence structure). The availability of spelling and grammar checking tools had no effect on holistic essay scores. These results indicate that automated spelling and grammar feedback contribute to modest, incremental improvements in writing quality that may complement automated strategy feedback. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11625 LNAI,,270-282,,10.1007/978-3-030-23204-7_23,,#6001,McCarthy 2019,,,0

Prognostication of waste water treatment plant performance using efficient soft computing models: An environmental evaluation,"Najafzadeh, M.; Zeinolabedini, M.","The chief purpose of designing the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is to provide a suitable system which is capable of eliminating the excessive impurities or pollutants found in the influent to the desired level. In this way, daily flow rates is one of the most crucial components to contribute in order to design wastewater treatment processes and plant units. So, in the present research work, various soft computing approaches including feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to predict daily flow rates for the WWTP. To develop artificial intelligence models, flow rates datasets has been used over a five-year period. The performance of the proposed models were assessed for training and testing stages using statistical error indicators. Performance of techniques indicated that SVM (RMSE = 1435.4 and MAE = 1031.1) and FFBP-NN (RMSE = 1445.9 and MAE = 1036.7) techniques have provided more precise prediction of flow rates compared to the ANFIS (RMSE = 1515.6 and MAE = 1075.4) and RBF-NN (RMSE = 1501 and MAE = 1048.7). This study was proven that soft computing techniques, as robust tools, can be efficiently applied to design the flow rates in the WWTP with a persuasive degree of accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Measurement: Journal of the International Measurement Confederation,138,,690-701,,10.1016/j.measurement.2019.02.014,,#6003,Najafzadeh 2019,,,0
"""What is the best method of family planning for me?"": A text mining analysis of messages between users and agents of a digital health service in Kenya","Green, E.P.; Whitcomb, A.; Kahumbura, C.; Rosen, J.G.; Goyal, S.; Achieng, D.; Bellows, B.","Background: Text message-based interventions have been shown to have consistently positive effects on health improvement and behavior change. Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of askNivi, a free sexual and reproductive health information service. Methods: We tokenized and processed more than 179,000 anonymized messages that users exchanged with live agents, enabling us to count word frequency overall, by sex, and by age/sex cohorts. We also conducted two manual coding exercises: (1) We manually classified the intent of 3,834 user messages in a training dataset; and (2) We manually coded all conversations between a random subset of 100 users who engaged in extended chats. Results: Between September 2017 and January 2019, 28,021 users (mean age 22.5 years, 63% female) sent 87,180 messages to askNivi, and 18 agents sent 92,429 replies. Users wrote most often about family planning methods, contraception, side effects, pregnancy, menstruation, and sex, but we observed different patterns by sex and age. User intents largely reflected the marketing focus on reproductive health, but other topics emerged. Most users sought factual information, but requests for advice and symptom reports were common. Conclusions: Young people in Kenya have a great desire for accurate and reliable information on health and wellbeing, which is easy to access and trustworthy. Text mining is one way to better understand how users engage with interventions like askNivi and maximize what artificial intelligence has to offer. © 2019 Green EP et al.",2019,,Gates Open Research,3,,,,10.12688/gatesopenres.12914.1,,#6004,Green 2019,,,0
Active learning for conversational interfaces in healthcare applications,"Härmä, A.; Polyakov, A.; Artemova, E.","In automated health services based on text and voice interfaces, there is a need to be able to understand what the user is talking about, and what is the attitude of the user towards a subject.

"Actual persuasiveness: Impact of personality, age and gender on message type susceptibility","Ciocarlan, A.; Masthoff, J.; Oren, N.","Persuasive technologies use a variety of strategies and principles to encourage people to adopt and maintain beneficial behaviours and attitudes. In this paper we investigate the influence of Cialdini’s seven persuasive principles on people’s choices, actions and behaviour. In contrast to related work investigating perceived persusaion, this study analyses actual persuasion. We also investigate the impact of personality, age and gender on people’s susceptibility to different message types. Furthermore, we investigate if people’s susceptibility to different persuasive messages is consistent over time. The findings suggest that certain persuasive principles have a greater influence on a person’s actions than others, with Reciprocity and Liking being the most effective. Our results differ from work investigating perceived persuasiveness, suggesting that what people perceive to be more persuasive is not necessarily what will persuade them to perform an action. Moreover, the study showed that people’s susceptibility to different principles is dependent on their personality traits, and it remains constant with time. The findings from this study have implications for future work on personalising persuasive strategies and designing digital behaviour change interventions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11433 LNCS,,283-294,,10.1007/978-3-030-17287-9_23,,#6008,Ciocarlan 2019,,,0
Health Behaviour Theory in Health Informatics: Support for Positive Change,"Medlock, S.; Wyatt, J.C.","The rising use of the Internet and information technology has made computerized interventions an attractive channel for providing advice and support for behaviour change. Health behaviour and behaviour change theories are a family of theories which aim to explain the mechanisms by which human behaviours change and use that knowledge to promote change. Among the best-known of these theories are the Social Learning and Social Cognitive theories, the Health Belief Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action and its successors the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Reasoned Action Approach, and the Transtheoretical model. We discuss three examples of how behaviour change theories have been applied in computer-based interventions: a system to aid users to quit smoking, a decision aid for choice of breast cancer therapy, and an internet-based exercise program for reducing cardiovascular risk. We also discuss misapplication of theory, and reflect on how these theories can best be used. Behaviour change theory can be applied in health informatics interventions in several ways; for example, to select participants for a particular intervention, to shape the content of the intervention to effectively influence behaviour, or to tailor content to individual needs. Application of these theories to provide personalized advice ('decision support') is a young but promising area of research, and could inform other decision support interventions, including those that provide support for clinicians. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.",2019,,Studies in Health Technology and Informatics,263,,146-158,,10.3233/SHTI190119,,#6009,Medlock 2019,,,0
Goal setting for persuasive information systems: Five reference checklists,"Cham, S.; Algashami, A.; McAlaney, J.; Stefanidis, A.; Phalp, K.; Ali, R.","The concept of goals is prominent in information systems and also artificial intelligence literature such as goal-oriented requirements engineering and self-adaptive systems. Digital motivation systems, e.g. gamification and persuasive technology, utilise the concept of behavioural goals which require a different mind-set on how to elicit and set them up, how to monitor deviation from such goals and how to ensure their completion. Behavioural goals are characterised by a range of factors which are not the main focus in classic information systems and AI literature such as self-efficacy, perceived usefulness. To engineer software supporting goal setting, a concretised taxonomy of goals would help a better-managed analysis and design process. In this paper, we provide a detailed classification of behavioural goals and their associated properties and elements (types, sources, monitoring, feedback, deviation and countermeasures). As a method, we review the literature on goal setting theory and its application in different disciplines. We subsequently develop five reference checklists which would act as a reference point for researchers and practitioners in persuasive and motivational systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11433 LNCS,,237-253,,10.1007/978-3-030-17287-9_20,,#6010,Cham 2019,,,0
Theoretical Domain Framework to Identify Cybersecurity Behaviour Constructs,"Mashiane, T.; Kritzinger, E.","Humans are still the weakest link in the cyber security system. In order to correct cybersecurity behaviour, it is important to understand both the behaviour as well as the cause of the behaviour. In an effort towards the latter, researchers have conducted empirical studies that investigate the constructs of cybersecurity behaviour. This approach has led to a plethora of constructs being proposed as the determinates of cybersecurity behavior. The large number of constructs make it difficult to decide which constructs to focus on when designing cybersecurity behavior interventions. This problem is not unique to cybersecurity behaviour. A similar problem exists in the medical domain. One proposed solution, that achieved good results in the medical domain, is the use of the Theoretical Domain Framework. The contribution of the current paper is a mapping of the constructs found in cybersecurity behaviour, to the Theoretical Domain Framework. This has been achieved by a systematic literature survey. The significance of the study is the identification and of the main behavioural constructs used in the cybersecurity domain. The findings of this research are aimed at being used as a basis when planning theory-based interventions for cybersecurity behaviour change. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",2019,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11937 LNCS,,320-329,,10.1007/978-3-030-35343-8_34,,#6012,Mashiane 2019,,,0
Considering patient safety in autonomous e-mental health systems - Detecting risk situations and referring patients back to human care,"Tielman, M.L.; Neerincx, M.A.; Pagliari, C.; Rizzo, A.; Brinkman, W.-P.","Background: Digital health interventions can fill gaps in mental healthcare provision. However, autonomous e-mental health (AEMH) systems also present challenges for effective risk management. To balance autonomy and safety, AEMH systems need to detect risk situations and act on these appropriately. One option is sending automatic alerts to carers, but such 'auto-referral' could lead to missed cases or false alerts. Requiring users to actively self-refer offers an alternative, but this can also be risky as it relies on their motivation to do so. This study set out with two objectives. Firstly, to develop guidelines for risk detection and auto-referral systems. Secondly, to understand how persuasive techniques, mediated by a virtual agent, can facilitate self-referral. Methods: In a formative phase, interviews with experts, alongside a literature review, were used to develop a risk detection protocol. Two referral protocols were developed - one involving auto-referral, the other motivating users to self-refer. This latter was tested via crowd-sourcing (n = 160). Participants were asked to imagine they had sleeping problems with differing severity and user stance on seeking help. They then chatted with a virtual agent, who either directly facilitated referral, tried to persuade the user, or accepted that they did not want help. After the conversation, participants rated their intention to self-refer, to chat with the agent again, and their feeling of being heard by the agent. Results: Whether the virtual agent facilitated, persuaded or accepted, influenced all of these measures. Users who were initially negative or doubtful about self-referral could be persuaded. For users who were initially positive about seeking human care, this persuasion did not affect their intentions, indicating that a simply facilitating referral without persuasion was sufficient. Conclusion: This paper presents a protocol that elucidates the steps and decisions involved in risk detection, something that is relevant for all types of AEMH systems. In the case of self-referral, our study shows that a virtual agent can increase users' intention to self-refer. Moreover, the strategy of the agent influenced the intentions of the user afterwards. This highlights the importance of a personalised approach to promote the user's access to appropriate care. © 2019 The Author(s).",2019,,BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making,19,1,,,10.1186/s12911-019-0796-x,,#6013,Tielman 2019,,,0
Understanding persuasion cascades in online product rating systems,"Xie, H.; Li, Y.; Lui, J.C.S.","Online product rating systems have become an indispensable component for numerous web services such as Amazon, eBay, Google play store and TripAdvisor. One functionality of such systems is to uncover the product quality via product ratings (or reviews) contributed by consumers. However, a well-known psychological phenomenon called “message-based persuasion” lead to “biased” product ratings in a cascading manner (we call this the persuasion cascade). This paper investigates: (1) How does the persuasion cascade influence the product quality estimation accuracy? (2) Given a real-world product rating dataset, how to infer the persuasion cascade and analyze it to draw practical insights? We first develop a mathematical model to capture key factors of a persuasion cascade. We formulate a high-order Markov chain to characterize the opinion dynamics of a persuasion cascade and prove the convergence of opinions. We further bound the product quality estimation error for a class of rating aggregation rules including the averaging scoring rule, via the matrix perturbation theory and the Chernoff bound. We also design a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer parameters of the persuasion cascade. We conduct experiments on the data from Amazon and TripAdvisor, and show that persuasion cascades notably exist, but the average scoring rule has a small product quality estimation error under practical scenarios.

Redefining the Approach to Cybersecurity,"Corradini, I.","One of the most critical issues in cybersecurity is represented by social engineering attacks. These threats have been known for years, but it is very difficult to handle them effectively, because they are strictly related to human nature. Social engineering is not just a phishing email; indeed, it is possible to distinguish several forms of attack which combine different elements, from human to social to physical and technological. According to a psychological point of view, social engineering is a powerful means of gaining information exploiting individuals’ weaknesses. Moreover, due to the mechanisms of persuasion, widely studied in literature, it is easy to imagine how complicated the management of this threat is. Appropriate training of employees, especially of key roles of the company, can be an effective antidote to social engineering. Given the current scenario and the future perspective in cybersecurity, it is clear that the approach used to manage cybersecurity requires a radical change. Currently, the preferred cybersecurity strategy is still based on technological solutions, without brilliant results, since cyberthreats keep growing. Many are convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be an opportunity for managing cybersecurity; whether true or not, it is however evident that AI has also the power to generate new threats and to strengthen the existing ones. Therefore, we should be very prudent when technologies are presented as a miracle solution for cybersecurity problems. The starting point is that technology has to be deployed under full human control. Then, critical thinking is needed to develop alternatives to improve the current approach to cybersecurity. In short, we need to develop a multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity, involving other disciplines and assuming different perspectives. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",2020,,"Studies in Systems, Decision and Control",284,,49-62,,10.1007/978-3-030-43999-6_3,,#6015,Corradini 2020,,,0

A study of integrative bargaining model with argumentation-based negotiation,"Park, J.; Rahman, H.A.; Suh, J.; Hussin, H.","E-commerce is increasingly competitive and there is a constant need for new approaches and technology to facilitate exchange. Emerging techniques include the use of artificial intelligence (AI). One AI tool that has sparked interest in e-commerce is the automated negotiation agent (negotiation-agent). This study examines such agents, and proposes an offer strategy model of integrative negotiation for a negotiation-agent with a focus on negotiation agent-to-human interaction. More specifically, a new offer strategy was developed based on the integrative bargaining model, which emphasizes the importance of exchanging information among negotiators and multi-issue negotiation that includes package offers to achieve an integrative (win-win) outcome. This study incorporated an argumentation-based negotiation and the negotiation tactic of multiple equivalent simultaneous offers, which was programmed into the negotiation-agent. An experiment was conducted performing 49 negotiation-agent-to-human negotiations over three issues in online purchase tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results indicated that the proposed offer strategy with agent negotiation can enhance the persuasiveness of an offer and the performance of negotiation outcome (human counterpart's perception toward negotiation process, opponent-agent and desire for future negotiation). The findings confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrated an innovative approach to e-commerce transactions. © 2019 by the authors.",2019,,Sustainability (Switzerland),11,23,,,10.3390/su11236832,,#6018,Park 2019,,,0

Gamification and Behavior Change Techniques in Diabetes Self-Management Apps,"Priesterroth, L.; Grammes, J.; Holtz, K.; Reinwarth, A.; Kubiak, T.","Background: Diabetes management apps may have positive effects on diabetes self-management. It remains unclear, however, which app features are particularly effective and encourage sustained app usage. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) and gamification are promising approaches to improve user engagement. However, little is known about the frequency BCTs and gamification techniques (GTs) are actually used. This app review aims to provide an overview of BCTs and GTs in current diabetes management apps. Methods: Google’s Play Store was searched for applications using a broad search strategy (keyword: “diabetes”). We limited our research to freely available apps. A total of 56 apps matched the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in terms of the features they offer to support self-management. We used a taxonomy comprising 29 BCTs and 17 GTs to evaluate the applications. Two independent raters tested and evaluated each app. Results: Interrater agreement was high (ICC =.75 for BCTs; ICC =.90 for GTs). An average of 7.4 BCTs (SD = 3.1) and an average of 1.4 out of 17 GTs (SD = 1.6) were implemented in each app. Five out of 29 BCTs accounted for 55.8% of the BCTs identified in total. The GT most often identified was “feedback” and accounted for 50% of the GTs. Conclusions: The potential of BCTs and GTs in diabetes management apps has not been fully exploited yet. Only very restricted sets of BCTs and gamification features were implemented. Systematic research on the efficacy of specific BCTs and GTs is needed to provide further guidance for app design. © 2019 Diabetes Technology Society.",2019,,Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology,13,5,954-958,,10.1177/1932296818822998,,#6024,Priesterroth 2019,,,0

However, to achieve this, there is a need to develop methods for acquiring appropriate arguments and counterargument that reflect both sides of the discussion. For instance, to persuade someone to do regular exercise, the chatbot needs to know counterarguments that the user might have for not doing exercise. To address this need, we present methods for acquiring arguments and counterarguments, and importantly, meta-level information that can be useful for deciding when arguments can be used during an argumentation dialogue. We evaluate these methods in studies with participants and show how harnessing these methods in a chatbot can make it more persuasive. © 2019 IEEE.",2019,,"Proceedings - International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI",2019-November,,1557-1562,,10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00224,,#6026,Chalaguine 2019,,,0
Study Protocol for the Effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Supported Automated Nutritional Intervention on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus,"Oka, R.; Nomura, A.; Yasugi, A.; Kometani, M.; Gondoh, Y.; Yoshimura, K.; Yoneda, T.","Introduction: Nutritional intervention is effective in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes but requires large inputs of manpower. Recent improvements in photo analysis technology facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and remote communication technologies have enabled automated evaluations of nutrient intakes. AI- and mobile-supported nutritional intervention is expected to be an alternative approach to conventional in-person nutritional intervention, but with less human resources, although supporting evidence is not yet complete. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that AI-supported nutritional intervention is as efficacious as the in-person, face-to-face method in terms of improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: This is a multicenter, unblinded, parallel, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of AI-supported automated nutrition therapy with that of conventional human nutrition therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes mainly controlled with diet are to be recruited and randomly assigned to AI-supported nutrition therapy (n = 50) and to human nutrition therapy (n = 50). Asken, a mobile application whose nutritional evaluation has been already validated to that by the classical method of weighted dietary records, has been specially modified for this study so that it follows the recommendations of Japan Diabetes Society (total energy restriction with proportion of carbohydrates to fat to protein of 50–60, 20, and 20–30%, respectively). Planned Outcomes: The primary outcome is the change in glycated hemoglobin levels from baseline to 12 months, and this outcome is to be compared between the two groups. The secondary outcomes are changes in fasting plasma glucose, plasma lipid profile, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressures, and urinary albumin excretion. The results of this randomized controlled trial will fill the gap between the demand for support of AI in nutritional interventions and the scientific evidence on its efficacy.

Crude oil price prediction model with long short term memory deep learning based on prior knowledge data transfer,"Cen, Z.; Wang, J.","Energy resources have acquired a strategic significance for economic growth and social welfare of any country throughout the history. Therefore, the prediction of crude oil price fluctuation is a significant issue. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, deep learning has attracted wide attention in various industrial fields. Some scientific research about using the deep learning model to fit and predict time series has been developed. In an attempt to increase the accuracy of oil market price prediction, Long Short Term Memory, a representative model of deep learning, is applied to fit crude oil prices in this paper. In the traditional application field of long short term memory, such as natural language processing, large amount of data is a consensus to improve training accuracy of long short term memory. In order to improve the prediction accuracy by extending the size of training set, transfer learning provides a heuristic data extension approach. Moreover, considering the equivalent of each historical data to train the long short term memory is difficult to reflect the changeable behaviors of crude oil markets, a very creative algorithm named data transfer with prior knowledge which provides a more availability data extension approach (three data types) is proposed. For comparing the predicting performance of initial data and data transfer deeply, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition is applied to decompose time series into several intrinsic mode functions, and these intrinsic mode functions are utilized to train the models. Further, the empirical research is performed in testing the prediction effect of West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil by evaluating the predicting ability of the proposed model, and the corresponding superiority is also demonstrated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2019,,Energy,169,,160-171,,10.1016/j.energy.2018.12.016,,#6029,Cen 2019,,,0
Long-term energy peak load forecasting models: A hybrid statistical approach,"Khorsheed, E.","Electricity demand forecasting is an essential process for electricity planning, designing strategies and recommending future energy policies. The changing behavior of the socio-economic growth beside the incomplete coverage of the environmental impacts can make a long-term energy demand forecasting process for a specific energy network challenging.

Time series analysis of seven years monthly load data was conducted. The method was hybridized with Machine-learning tools to find suitable forecasting linear and non-linear models for Bahrain electricity network. Residual analysis was adopted to find the model that best fit the Peak load data. Cross validation aims to evaluate the efficiency of a predictive model. For this purpose, a new peak load data set for an eight year was gathered and tested. Results are reported to guide Bahrain electricity network forecasting needs for the next future years.

Experiences of a motivational interview delivered by a robot: Qualitative study,"Da Silva, J.G.G.; Kavanagh, D.J.; Belpaeme, T.; Taylor, L.; Beeson, K.; Andrade, J.","Background: Motivational interviewing is an effective intervention for supporting behavior change but traditionally depends on face-to-face dialogue with a human counselor. This study addressed a key challenge for the goal of developing social robotic motivational interviewers: creating an interview protocol, within the constraints of current artificial intelligence, which participants will find engaging and helpful. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore participants' qualitative experiences of a motivational interview delivered by a social robot, including their evaluation of usability of the robot during the interaction and its impact on their motivation. Methods: NAO robots are humanoid, child-sized social robots. We programmed a NAO robot with Choregraphe software to deliver a scripted motivational interview focused on increasing physical activity. The interview was designed to be comprehensible even without an empathetic response from the robot. Robot breathing and face-tracking functions were used to give an impression of attentiveness. A total of 20 participants took part in the robot-delivered motivational interview and evaluated it after 1 week by responding to a series of written open-ended questions. Each participant was left alone to speak aloud with the robot, advancing through a series of questions by tapping the robot's head sensor. Evaluations were content-analyzed utilizing Boyatzis' steps: (1) sampling and design, (2) developing themes and codes, and (3) validating and applying the codes. Results: Themes focused on interaction with the robot, motivation, change in physical activity, and overall evaluation of the intervention. Participants found the instructions clear and the navigation easy to use. Most enjoyed the interaction but also found it was restricted by the lack of individualized response from the robot. Many positively appraised the nonjudgmental aspect of the interview and how it gave space to articulate their motivation for change. Some participants felt that the intervention increased their physical activity levels. Conclusions: Social robots can achieve a fundamental objective of motivational interviewing, encouraging participants to articulate their goals and dilemmas aloud. Because they are perceived as nonjudgmental, robots may have advantages over more humanoid avatars for delivering virtual support for behavioral change. © Joana Galvão Gomes da Silva, David J Kavanagh, Tony Belpaeme, Lloyd Taylor, Konna Beeson, Jackie Andrade.",2018,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,20,5,,,10.2196/jmir.7737,,#6032,DaSilva 2018,,,0

This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. The major objective of this 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial is to test the comparative effectiveness of two linguistically and culturally adapted, community-based physical activity interventions with the potential for broad reach and translation. Ten local community centers serving a sizable number of Latino residents were randomized to receive one of two physical activity interventions. The Virtual Advisor program employs a computer-based embodied conversational agent named “Carmen” to deliver interactive, individually tailored physical activity advice and support. A similar intervention program is delivered by trained Peer Advisors. The target population consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 50 years and older living within proximity to a designated community center. The major outcomes are changes in walking and other forms of physical activity measured via self-report and accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include physical function and well-being variables. In addition to these outcome analyses, comparative cost analysis of the two programs, potential mediators of intervention success, and baseline moderators of intervention effects will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention.

Advances and Controversies in Diet and Physical Activity Measurement in Youth,"Spruijt-Metz, D.; Wen, C.K.F.; Bell, B.M.; Intille, S.; Huang, J.S.; Baranowski, T.","Technological advancements in the past decades have improved dietary intake and physical activity measurements. This report reviews current developments in dietary intake and physical activity assessment in youth. Dietary intake assessment has relied predominantly on self-report or image-based methods to measure key aspects of dietary intake (e.g., food types, portion size, eating occasion), which are prone to notable methodologic (e.g., recall bias) and logistic (e.g., participant and researcher burden) challenges. Although there have been improvements in automatic eating detection, artificial intelligence, and sensor-based technologies, participant input is often needed to verify food categories and portions. Current physical activity assessment methods, including self-report, direct observation, and wearable devices, provide researchers with reliable estimations for energy expenditure and bodily movement. Recent developments in algorithms that incorporate signals from multiple sensors and technology-augmented self-reporting methods have shown preliminary efficacy in measuring specific types of activity patterns and relevant contextual information. However, challenges in detecting resistance (e.g., in resistance training, weight lifting), prolonged physical activity monitoring, and algorithm (non)equivalence remain to be addressed. In summary, although dietary intake assessment methods have yet to achieve the same validity and reliability as physical activity measurement, recent developments in wearable technologies in both arenas have the potential to improve current assessment methods.

Modeling tactical lane-change behavior for automated vehicles: A supervised machine learning approach,"Motamedidehkordi, N.; Amini, S.; Hoffmann, S.; Busch, F.; Fitriyanti, M.R.","In recent years, due to growing interest in automated driving, the need for better understanding the humans driving behavior, and particularly the lane changing and car following behavior, has further increased. Despite its great importance, lane changing has not been studied as extensively as longitudinal behavior and remains one of the most challenging driving behavior maneuvers to understand and to predict. Drivers take into account many factors while making a tactical decision, which cannot be precisely represented by the conventional rule-based models. In this paper, we compare the results of different supervised machine learning classifiers to better understand the lane change decision of drivers using the NGSIM database. For this aim, after choosing the relevant features, the ones which contribute the most to the model were chosen with the help of feature importance analysis. Afterward, the training dataset was used to train the model with naive Bayes, support vector machines, logic regression, nearest neighborhoods, decision trees, extra trees and random forest classifiers.

Intelligent Conversational Agent for Online Sales,"Jusoh, S.","A conversational agent is one of emerging technologies that will take place in several of life domains, including e-commerce. The common features of any conversational agent in any domain is its ability to have a dialog with a human user and 24/7 available.

However, a conversational agent for online sales may have a different feature than a conversational agent in other domain such as health care. The main task of a conversational agent in an online sales domain is to engage and persuade e-commerce customers to buy a product. In a real life, persuasion is considered as an abstract process, which only can be achieved through a series of dialogs. In a virtual world, a conversational agent for online sales is considered intelligent if it is able to demonstrate this feature.

An Analysis of the Interaction Between Intelligent Software Agents and Human Users,"Burr, C.; Cristianini, N.; Ladyman, J.","Interactions between an intelligent software agent (ISA) and a human user are ubiquitous in everyday situations such as access to information, entertainment, and purchases. In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user’s access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user’s behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA’s utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour. We discuss some of the ethical, social and legal implications of this technology and argue that it can sometimes exploit and reinforce weaknesses in human beings. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,,Minds and Machines,28,4,735-774,,10.1007/s11023-018-9479-0,,#6044,Burr 2018,,,0

Towards finding windows of opportunity for ubiquitous healthy eating interventions,"Terzimehić, N.; Schneegass, C.; Hussmann, H.","Persuasion towards healthier eating decisions is a challenging field of research, depending on various internal and external factors. Recent advances in sensor-enriched mobile devices and wearables enable persuasive techniques to predict and influence people’s food decisions. One such technique, just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), provide users with personalized and situation-related content and thus, exploit windows of high user receptiveness for persuasion. This work’s aim is to shed light on context characteristics of such windows by analyzing 469 meal decisions as well as relating in-depth interviews on eating behaviour. We derive and describe four interesting windows in which JITAI’s could be effective: (1) Lack of Alternatives, (2) Unawareness of Alternatives, (3) Evening Cravings, and (4) Social Pressure. On the basis of these situations, we postulate recommendations for timing and content of JITAIs for healthy eating.

The portrayal of quit emotions: Content-sensitive analysis of peer interactions in an online community for smoking cessation,"Sridharan, V.; Cohen, T.; Cobb, N.; Myneni, S.","Tobacco use causes serious emotional harm among smokers and it manifests in the form of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. The effects of smoking cessation on quality of life are well documented. However, our understanding of emotional well-being of an individual in the window of quit and relapse period to provide just in time support is quite limited. In this study, we focus on social engagement, communication attributes, and emotional landscape of successful quitters as manifested in peer interactions of an online health community for smoking cessation. Further, we employed Word Embedding techniques to analyze the content-specific communication attributes in a given quit episode at scale. Results indicate users were highly engaged after a quit. The emotional index of successful quitters highlighted the fragile and complex nature of sentiments associated with a quit episode. The behavior change techniques popular before quit were ‘goals and planning’ and ‘self-belief’ and after quit were ‘feedback and monitoring’ and ‘goals and planning’. Communication genres popular before quit were ‘family and friends’ and ‘quit readiness’, whereas focus on ‘traditions’, ‘quit progress’ and ‘quit obstacles’ was high after quit.

BMES and BM’s (Lindgren in J Multi Bus Model Innov Technol 4:1, 2016; Lindgren and Rasmussen in J Multi Bus Model Innov Technol 1: 135, 2013) have for a longtime been based and built up with mainly human bond communication, but new technologies very much based on machine to human communication and machine to machine communication evolves and change the game of BMI with exponential speed. How will this change the game of Business Model Innovation (BMI) between humans, humans and machines and machines to machines. How will this evolvement influence businesses ability to “download”, “see”, “sense”, “relate” and “receive” and relate BM’s with their AS IS and TO BE BM’s. The paper addresses the exponential development of artificial intelligence technologies, persuasive technologies, virtual technologies and thereby increase the potential to create, capture, deliver, receive and consume physical, digital, persuasive and virtual BMs in Business model innovation and introduce a conceptual model to future business model innovation and operation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2018,,Wireless Personal Communications,100,1,97-111,,10.1007/s11277-018-5612-x,,#6050,Valter 2018,,,0
Argument harvesting using chatbots,"Chalaguine, L.A.; Hamilton, F.L.; Hunter, A.; Potts, H.W.W.","Much research in computational argumentation assumes that arguments can be obtained in some way. Yet, to improve and apply models of argument, we need methods for acquiring them. Current approaches include argument mining from text, hand coding of arguments by researchers, or generating arguments from knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call argument harvesting, that uses a chatbot to enter into a dialogue with a participant to get arguments and counterarguments from him or her. Because it is automated, the chatbot can be used repeatedly in many dialogues, and thereby it can generate a large corpus. We describe the architecture of the chatbot, provide methods for clustering arguments by their similarity and value, and an evaluation of our approach in a case study concerning attitudes of women to participation in sport. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.",2018,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,305,,149-160,,10.3233/978-1-61499-906-5-149,,#6051,Chalaguine 2018,,,0

Intend to analyze Social Media feeds to detect behavioral trends of individuals to proactively act against Social Threats,"Jindal, S.; Sharma, K.","Just few years ago, many of us and rest of the world believed that social media was just fun, unproductive and pointless technical whim. But today, the use of social media has become a necessity and needless to mention, the crucial part of everyone's life, career & business. Today with the use of social media, people connect with people from whole world, express themselves, advertise their stuff & brands, and in many other forms. Although, Social Media is not just a business tool or a tool for self-promotion, it can surely contribute in a much larger spectrum and intensity to the society. Social media can help predict a Crime and its prevention too! To prevent events of crime by analyzing the behavioral changes and sentiment analysis of a person by predicting his/her thought process and line of thoughts through his/her social media is possible with the use of readily available and reliable techniques like Iterative Clustering. It can be used to provide immediate help and solution (with a collaborate team of Law Enforcement Agencies and Mental Health professionals/ Psychoanalysts) to a person who is going to risk his own life (suicide), or who is going to be a part of such criminal act. As a proactive measure, it can help provide immediate services/information to the victims and people in danger too. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to find the person who are deviating from their normal behavior using unsupervised learning(clustering) and further classifying them in predefined categories. If the behavior change is within first threshold, it shows the change in behavior is normal and may not harm anyone. If the change is above first threshold, it shows noticeable change in behavior and need some attention by friends and family. But if the change is above second threshold value, that shows drastic change in behavior and may require immediate action. Profile of this person could also be verified by data provided with the police if any previous crime record is available with them. © 2018 The Authors.

Evaluation of dishonest argumentation based on an opponent model: A preliminary report,"Kokusho, K.; Takahashi, K.","This paper discusses persuasive dialogue in a case where dishonesty is permitted. We have previously proposed a dialogue model based on a predicted opponent model using an abstract argumentation framework, and discussed the conditions under which a dishonest argument could be accepted without being detected. However, it is hard to estimate the outcome of a dialogue, or identify causality between agents' knowledge and the result. In this paper, we implement our dialogue model and execute argumentations between agents under different conditions. We analyze the results of these experiments and discuss about them. In brief, our results show that the use of dishonest arguments affects the likelihood of successfully persuading the opponent, or winning a debate game, but we could not identify a relationship between the results of a dialogue and the initial argumentation frameworks of the agents. © 2018 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Machine learning for personalized challenges in a gamified sustainable mobility scenario,"Khoshkangini, R.; Marconi, A.; Valleto, G.","Gamification has been successfully applied in several application domains to persuade people to reach to a certain goal. However, such persuasive technologies have concerns to keep players engaged and to sustain newly acquired behaviors for a long term. One option to tackle this issue is personalizing the gamified experience for each individual player. To this end, we developed a framework that can personalize the game content by proposing to players challenges that are tailored to their profiles and game histories.

"Designing and developing lifelike, engaging lifestyle coaching agents and scenarios for multiparty coaching interaction","Huizing, G.; Klaassen, R.; Heylen, D.","The use of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) in the domain of lifestyle coaching has been the subject of many studies in the last decades. With ageing populations in many countries, the pressure on healthcare systems is increasing. ECAs can be a potential tool to help combat this pressure through the promotion of a healthier lifestyle among older adults, as well as through coaching and counselling of older adults on how to manage their health. Designing more lifelike and engaging ECAs is of key importance to further this goal, as this could help encourage self-disclosure by the users towards the ECAs, could make the ECAs more persuasive, and could increase engagement and enjoyment of the interactions by the users, among other things. The Council of Coaches project aims to provide users with virtual coaching done by several lifestyle coaching agents with different domains of expertise as well as varying backstories, personalities, mannerisms, motivations and looks, among other things. To work towards this goal, work has been done on character and personality design for an initial set of lifestyle coaching agents and defined initial interaction scenarios. These were inspired by literature on coaching and ECAs, videos of interactions between healthcare professionals and patient actors, conversations with healthcare professionals, and brainstorming sessions. This paper presents the work done within the project thus far and closes out by presenting our plans to address the question: What are the possible advantages and disadvantages of a multiple agent approach as compared to a single agent approach to coaching interactions with older adults? © 2018 CEUR-WS.

Predicting confidence and doubt in accented speakers: Human perception and machine learning experiments,"Jiang, X.; Pell, M.D.","Speech prosody provides salient and reliable cues to facilitate social communication. What computational mechanism underlies social judgment towards “out-group” speakers is unclear. This paper focused on Speaker Confidence, a factor affecting one’s trustworthiness, persuasiveness and feeling of (un)knowing, and Speaker Accent, a factor marking one’s identity. We demonstrate that native Canadian-English listeners can recognize confident and doubtful expressions in foreign-and regional-accented speakers. A stronger impression of confidence was shown towards the native speakers. The acoustic analysis demonstrated that speakers systematically varied the mean fundamental frequency to indicate confident and doubt regardless of accent. The outgroup speakers varied more on intensity height and variation to achieve certain level of confidence. Machine learning experiments showed above-chance accuracies in all accents to classify vocal expression based on global acoustic cues, highlighting the role of acoustic regularities at utterance level in confidence encoding. Moreover, the classification rate was higher when the model trained in native accent was tested on the native than the regional accent, highlighting an in-group bias of predicting novel vocal expression of confidence from acoustic cues. These findings lend support to the dialect theory of vocal expression recognition while demonstrating a computational mechanism underlying inter-cultural/intergroup confidence perception via speech prosody. © 2018, International Speech Communications Association.

Behavioral-Based Classification and Identification of Ransomware Variants Using Machine Learning,"Daku, H.; Zavarsky, P.; Malik, Y.","Due to the changing behavior of ransomware, traditional classification and detection techniques do not accurately detect new variants of ransomware. Attackers use polymorphic and metamorphic techniques to avoid detection of signature-based systems. We use machine learning classification to identify modified variants of ransomware based on their behavior. To conduct our study, we used behavioral reports of 150 ransomware samples from 10 different ransomware families. Our data-set includes some of the newest ransomware samples available, providing an evaluation of the classification accuracy of machine learning algorithms on the current evolving status of ransomware. An iterative approach is used to identify optimum behavioral attributes used to achieve best classification accuracy. Two main parts of this study are identification of the behavioral attributes which can be used for optimal classification accuracy and classification of ransomware using machine learning algorithms. We have evaluated classification accuracy of three machine learning classification algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.",2018,,"Proceedings - 17th IEEE International Conference on Trust, Security and Privacy in Computing and Communications and 12th IEEE International Conference on Big Data Science and Engineering, Trustcom/BigDataSE 2018",,,1560-1564,,10.1109/TrustCom/BigDataSE.2018.00224,,#6063,Daku 2018,,,0
Assuring explainability on demand response targeting via credit scoring,"Lee, K.; Lee, H.; Yoon, Y.; Lee, E.; Rhee, W.","As data-driven innovation becomes a main trend in the energy sector, explainability of data-driven actions is becoming a major fairness issue for the residential applications, and it is expected to become a requirement for regulatory compliance. Explainability, however, often demands a sacrifice in prediction performance and affects the effectiveness of data-driven actions. In this study, we consider data-driven customer targeting in an incentive-based residential demand response program, and investigate the explainability-performance tradeoff when using simple-rule based, machine learning, and credit scoring methods. Credit scoring, that has been a popular solution in the finance discipline for over 60 years, is a scorecard based modeling method that can surely provide explainability. We first provide the detailed steps of applying credit scoring to the demand response problem. Then, we use a dataset of 14,525 households obtained from a real demand response program and analyze two prediction problems – participation prediction and behavior change prediction. The results show that credit scoring can achieve a comparable performance as the best-performing machine learning methods while providing full explainability. Our results suggest that credit scoring can be a promising explainability option for broader energy sector problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",2018,,Energy,161,,670-679,,10.1016/j.energy.2018.07.179,,#6064,Lee 2018,,,0
Failure Cause Extraction of Railway Switches Based on Text Mining,"Lin, C.; Wang, G.","Text mining is useful for knowledge extraction. As an effective textual data analysis technology, it has been widely promoted in many fields. In railway domain, millions of repair verbatims are recorded in the form of text. These ample but unexploited textual data can provide abundant knowledge for us to guarantee the normal operation of railway transportation and relieve maintainers’ labor intensity. However, railway switches with different number of operation times, types, in different areas and climates will have various failure cause. Hence, in order to diagnose and predict failures of railway switches quickly and precisely, it is necessary to know all failure cause of the batch of equipment in advance. In this paper, we use text mining technology to extract fault cause using a real-world dataset. To our best knowledge, it is the first research which focuses on failure cause extraction of railway switches based on text mining, and CHI method is used for selecingt features.

Supporting diverse challenges of ageing with digital enhanced living solutions,"Grundy, J.; Mouzakis, K.; Vasa, R.; Cain, A.; Curumsing, M.; Abdelrazek, M.; Fernando, N.","By the 2050, it is estimated that the proportion of people over the age of 80 will have risen from 3.9% to 9.1% of population of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A large proportion of these people will need significant help to manage various chronic illnesses, including dementia, heart disease, diabetes, limited physical movement and many others. Current approaches typically focus on acute episodes of illness and are not well designed to provide adequately for daily living care support. In our rapidly ageing society, a critical need exists for effective, affordable, scalable and safe in- home and in-residential care solutions leveraging a range of current and emerging sensor, interaction and integration technologies. Key aims are to support the ageing to live longer in their own homes; make daily challenges associated with ageing less limiting through use of technology supports; better support carers - both professional and family - in providing monitoring, proactive intervention, and community connectedness; enable in-home and in-residential care organisations to scale their support services and better use their workforces; and ultimately provide better quality of life. Deakin University researchers have been investigating a range of emerging technologies and platforms to realise this vision, which we in broad terms coin Digital Enhanced Living, in the ageing space but also supporting those with anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, various chronic diseases, recovery from injury, and various predictive analytics. A Smart Home solution, carried out in conjunction with a local start-up, has produced and trialled a novel sensor, interaction, and AI- based technology. Virtual Reality (VR) solutions have been used to support carers in the set-up of dementia-friendly homes, in conjunction with Alzheimers Australia. Activity and nutrition solutions, including the use of conversational agents, have been used to build dialogue to engage and change behaviour. Predictive analytics, in conjunction with major hospitals, have been applied to large medical datasets to better support professionals making judgements around discharge outcomes. A set of lessons have been learned from the design, deployment and trialing of these diverse solutions and new development approaches have been crafted to address the challenges faced. In particular, we found that there is a need to consider user emotional expectations as first-class citizens and create methodologies that consider the user needs during the creation of the software solutions. We find that quality and emotional aspects have to be engineered into the solution, rather than added after a technical solution is deployed. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

Conversational agents to suppress customer anger in text-based customer-support conversations,"Kuramoto, I.; Yoshikawa, Y.; Baba, J.; Kawabata, T.; Ogawa, K.; Ishiguro, H.","Emotional labor in text-based chat environments will be widespread in the near future. It is difficult for novice workers to make smooth conversation with an angry customer in a customer-support working environment, one of the stressful emotional labors. In this paper, we propose a method to suppress the customer’s anger based on a communication agent introduced into customer-support work in order to facilitate smooth communication. The agent first establishes a positive relationship with the customer, and then the attitude changes to be sympathetic to the customer-support worker in order for the customer to follow sympathy and reduce anger. From the experimental evaluation, it is found that there is the possibility of suppressing the participants’ anger by this method, but the anger itself is at a higher level than in the common environment without the agent. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Reflection through gaming: Reinforcing health message response through gamified rehearsal,"Tikka, P.; Laitinen, M.; Manninen, I.; Oinas-Kukkonen, H.","Reflection is generally considered an effective means of achieving behavior change. A gamified approach to promoting rehearsal and reflection in a healthy eating context was studied. The game was based on the principles of the Implicit Attitude Test: by categorizing food items under positive or negative associations the players would gain points according to how fast they categorized foods under positive or negative associations. Game scores constituted feedback for reflection, and repeated playing constituted rehearsal of target responses. Experiment participants (N = 58) played the game over a five-day period.

The Human Behaviour-Change Project: Harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning for evidence synthesis and interpretation,"Michie, S.; Thomas, J.; Johnston, M.; Aonghusa, P.M.; Shawe-Taylor, J.; Kelly, M.P.; Deleris, L.A.; Finnerty, A.N.; Marques, M.M.; Norris, E.; O'Mara-Eves, A.; West, R.","Background: Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges facing human health and wellbeing and to promoting the uptake of research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better use of the vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the uptake of that evidence into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of synthesising and interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer support. The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and evaluate a 'Knowledge System' that automatically extracts, synthesises and interprets findings from BCI evaluation reports to generate new insights about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention effectiveness and (ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get answers to variants of the question 'What works, compared with what, how well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what settings and why?'. Methods: The HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and their reports linking effect sizes for given target behaviours with intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated by exposure, populations and settings; b) develop and train an automated feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports to predict effect sizes for particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and settings; d) build user and machine interfaces for interrogating and updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of performance and utility. Discussion: The HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise, interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour change interventions that is up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the usefulness, and support the implementation of, that evidence. © 2017 The Author(s).",2017,,Implementation Science,12,1,,,10.1186/s13012-017-0641-5,,#6073,Michie 2017,,,0
Toward personalized and adaptive QoS assessments via context awareness,"Barakat, L.; Taylor, P.; Griffiths, N.; Taweel, A.; Luck, M.; Miles, S.","Quality of Service (QoS) properties play an important role in distinguishing between functionally equivalent services and accommodating the different expectations of users. However, the subjective nature of some properties and the dynamic and unreliable nature of service environments may result in cases where the quality values advertised by the service provider are either missing or untrustworthy. To tackle this, a number of QoS estimation approaches have been proposed, using the observation history available on a service to predict its performance. Although the context underlying such previous observations (and corresponding to both user and service related factors) could provide an important source of information for the QoS estimation process, it has only been used to a limited extent by existing approaches. In response, we propose a context-aware quality learning model, realized via a learning-enabled service agent, exploiting the contextual characteristics of the domain to provide more personalized, accurate, and relevant quality estimations for the situation at hand. The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing promising results (in terms of prediction accuracy) in different types of changing service environments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",2018,,Computational Intelligence,34,2,468-494,,10.1111/coin.12129,,#6074,Barakat 2018,,,0

Team persuasion,"Kohan Marzagão, D.; Murphy, J.; Young, A.P.; Gauy, M.M.; Luck, M.; McBurney, P.; Black, E.","We consider two teams of agents engaging in a debate to persuade an audience of the acceptability of a central argument. This is modelled by a bipartite abstract argumentation framework with a distinguished topic argument, where each argument is asserted by a distinct agent. One partition defends the topic argument and the other partition attacks the topic argument. The dynamics are based on flag coordination games: in each round, each agent decides whether to assert its argument based on local knowledge. The audience can see the induced sub-framework of all asserted arguments in a given round, and thus the audience can determine whether the topic argument is acceptable, and therefore which team is winning. We derive an analytical expression for the probability of either team winning given the initially asserted arguments, where in each round, each agent probabilistically decides whether to assert or withdraw its argument given the number of attackers. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10757 LNAI,,159-174,,10.1007/978-3-319-75553-3_12,,#6077,KohanMarzagão 2018,,,0

Time to be “smart”—opportunities arising from smartphone-based behavioral analysis in daily patient care,"Akeret, K.; Vasella, F.; Geisseler, O.; Dannecker, N.; Ghosh, A.; Brugger, P.; Regli, L.; Stienen, M.N.","While pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS) are often associated with neuropsychological deficits, adequate quantification and monitoring of such deficits remains challenging. Due to their complex nature, comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations are needed, which are time-consuming, resource-intensive and do not adequately account for daily or hourly fluctuations of a patient’s condition. Innovative approaches are required to improve the diagnostics and continuous monitoring of brain function, ideally in the form of a simple, objective, time-saving and inexpensive tool that overcomes the aforementioned weaknesses of conventional assessments. As smartphones are widely used and integrated in virtually every aspect of our lives, their potential regarding the acquisition of data representing an individual’s behavior and health is enormous. Alterations in a patient’s physical or mental health state may be recognized as behavioral deviation from the physiological range of the normal population, but also in comparison to the patient’s individual baseline assessment. As smartphone-based assessment allows for continuous monitoring and therefore accounts for possible fluctuations or transiently occurring abnormalities in a patient’s neurologic state, it may serve as a surveillance tool in the acute setting for early recognition of complications, or in the long-term outpatient setting to quantify rehabilitation or disease progress. This may be particularly interesting for regions of the world where healthcare resources for comprehensive clinical/neuropsychological examinations are insufficient or distances to healthcare providers are long. Here, we highlight the potential of smartphone-based behavioral monitoring in healthcare.

A massive sarcastic robot: What a great idea! two approaches to the computational generation of irony,"Veale, T.","Irony is a versatile seasoning for language that is just as useful for sugaring insults as for salting compliments. It is a flavoring that adds bite to much of our online interaction, making its computational analysis – recognition and understanding – a necessity for affective language processing. If the computational generation of irony is a harder sell, it is perhaps because this mode of communication is so often vexing for humans too. However, an artificial fluency with irony is as desirable as fluency in any form of creative language, from metaphor and analogy to humour and persuasive argumentation. We explore two distinct approaches to irony generation in this paper: knowledge-based generation ab initio, and a more shallow approach we name ‘mere re-generation.’ We consider the relative merits of each, conduct a user evaluation, and demonstrate some practical uses. © ICCC 2018.All rights reserved.",2018,,"Proceedings of the 9th International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC 2018",,,120-127,,,,#6081,Veale 2018,,,0

Detecting behaviour changes in accelerometer data,"Diaz, C.; Yacef, K.","How can the impact of Health Education programs promoting physical activity be analysed? One common way with learning programs is to conduct pre- and post-tests and measure whether/how target knowledge has evolved. In the case of physical activity, unobtrusive accelerometers can capture detailed data about people’s movements, but the challenge is to extract information from these raw data to investigate whether/how physical activity behaviours have evolved. This paper presents a methodology to do so, by extracting bouts of physical activity of specific intensity levels and of various lengths, and by using these as features to cluster students’ daily behaviours before and after intervention. This approach enables a more insightful analysis of the physical activity behaviours of the participants, and point to the nature of behaviour changes, if present. We illustrate this methodology with pre- and post-test data collected in the context of an e-learning program aimed at educating school children about healthy behaviours, with a focus on reaching recommended levels of daily physical activity: the pre- and post-tests were carried out by measuring unobtrusively and continuously their physical activity for five consecutive school days using research-grade accelerometers (GENEActiv).",2018,,CEUR Workshop Proceedings,2148,,21-26,,,,#6083,Diaz 2018,,,0

Towards a general framework for dialogues that accommodate reasoning about preferences,"Modgil, S.","Argumentation theory provides foundations for distributed non- monotonic reasoning in the form of inter-agent dialogues. However current dialogue models do not accommodate reasoning about possibly conflicting preferences used in arbitrating amongst attacking arguments. We provide a framework for persuasion dialogues that accommodates such reasoning. Agents exchange locutions that implicitly define an ASPIC+ theory consisting of rules and premises. The theory’s defined arguments instantiate an extended argumentation framework (EAF) that accommodates arguments claiming preferences over other arguments, so that evaluation of the EAF’s justified arguments determines the outcome of the dialogue. We also evaluate the outcome of a dialogue based on the dialectical status of moves in the dialogue, propose restrictions on dialogue moves and conjecture correspondences between the two outcome definitions. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10757 LNAI,,175-191,,10.1007/978-3-319-75553-3_13,,#6085,Modgil 2018,,,0

Persuasive dialog system using emotional expressions,"Ishikawa, Y.; Mizukami, M.; Yoshino, K.; Sakti, S.; Suzuki, Y.; Nakamura, S.","Using emotional expressions in a conversation is an efficient way to convey one’s thoughts. Emotional expressions of the persuader have a strong impact to the recipient’s attitude in a negotiation. Studies for a persuasive dialog system, which tries to lead users to the system’s specific goals, show that incorporating users’ emotional factors can enhance the system to persuade users. However, in a human-human negotiation, the persuader can have better outcomes not only through considering the emotion of the other person but also through expressing his or her own emotions. In this paper, we propose an example-based persuasive dialog system with expressive emotion capability. The proposed dialog system is trained by newly collected corpus with statistical learning. Emotional states and the user’s acceptance rate of the persuasion are annotated.

Culturally-aware healthcare systems,"Yin, L.; Bickmore, T.","Cultural congruity between patients and healthcare providers has been demonstrated to be an important factor in maximizing the efficacy of healthcare. Similarly, the targeting and tailoring of health messages for a particular culture has been shown to increase their impact on patients, compared to generic messages. These findings indicate the importance of culture in designing messages, interventions, and care protocols intended to increase population health, especially for minority cultures for which generic messages and interventions represent a cultural mismatch. As our healthcare processes become automated—to increase access, decrease cost, and improve care—attention to cultural cues and their effects becomes more and more important. While cultural cues can be encoded in very subtle ways in any computer interface, embodied conversational agents provide a health communication medium in which culture can be explicitly encoded in order to achieve the same benefits of cultural congruity and tailoring seen in human-human interactions. In this chapter we review research on cultural congruity and tailoring in traditional medicine, and how these effects can be achieved with conversational agents. We present the results of an empirical study of the effects of cultural and linguistic tailoring of an animated exercise coach on user ratings of the coach’s trustworthiness and persuasiveness. We then review two large-scale systems for longitudinal health behavior change intervention which feature conversational agent-based health coaches tailored for specific minority cultures: Latinos in Northern California and those in the Boston area.

Interacting with motivational virtual agent: The effects of message framing and regulatory fit in an E-learning environment,"Liew, T.W.; Tan, S.-M.; Gan, C.L.","Virtual agents can be integrated in e-learning environments to encourage learning behavior through persuasive and motivational messages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of agent's message-frame, i.e., gainframe and loss-frame on cognitive load and intrinsic motivation of learners interacting with motivational virtual agent in an e-learning environment. Based on regulatory fit theory, this study also investigated if matching a learner's regulatory focus orientation i.e., promotion-focus or prevention-focus to compatible agent's message-frame i.e., gain-frame or loss-frame would produce cognitive and motivational benefits. The results of our experiment (n=210) revealed that the motivational virtual agent that utilized lossframe message to encourage learning behavior induced significantly higher germane cognitive load and intrinsic motivation in learners, as compared to the gain-frame motivational virtual agent.

Changing stigmatizing attitudes to mental health via education and contact with embodied conversational agents,"Sebastian, J.; Richards, D.","Educating society concerning stigmatized conditions, such as the eating disorder Anorexia Nervosa (AN), aims to change attitudes that will encourage individuals with AN to recognize their condition and decide to seek help. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",2017,,Computers in Human Behavior,73,,479-488,,10.1016/j.chb.2017.03.071,,#6101,Sebastian 2017,,,0

Words in freedom: A manifesto machine as critical design,"Ashby, S.; Hanna, J.; Matos, S.; Rodrigues, R.","Words in Freedom is a design project aimed at artists, activists, and others that draws from research on the manifesto to create a studio environment or ‘Manifesto Machine’. Drawing primarily on the sub-disciplines of Design for Good and Critical Design, this project seeks to enhance conscious self-expression and empowerment while questioning design’s inbuilt optimism and the effects of automation on human agency. When we automate for improved performance, what do we lose in the process? Do the benefits outweigh the loss of agency? How can technology aid expression without over determining it? Ultimately, Words in Freedom seeks to create a collaborative writing environment that strikes the right balance between freedom and constraint, agency and inspiration. We trace the manifesto’s return to prominence in digital form, arguing for its usefulness as a potent discursive artifact. We then describe the Manifesto Machine as a set of tools to help write and disseminate persuasive manifestos, introducing our initial prototype (or probe, as in Reflective Design) as a means of conducting our primary research, engaging with groups and understanding social practices around declaring principles and beliefs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10714 LNCS,,557-566,,10.1007/978-3-319-76270-8_38,,#6105,Ashby 2018,,,0

Cardiovascular reactions during exposure to persuasion principles,"Spelt, H.; Westerink, J.; Ham, J.; IJsselsteijn, W.","To optimize effectiveness of persuasive technology, understanding also psychophysiological processes of persuasion is crucial. The current research explored cardiovascular reactions to persuasive messages using four persuasion principles proposed by Cialdini (authority, scarcity, consensus, and commitment) in a laboratory experiment. The study had a randomized within-subject design. Participants (N = 56) were presented with 4 × 14 persuasive messages while cardiovascular reactions were measured with electrocardiography. Findings showed significantly different cardiovascular arousal regarding inter-beat interval and standard deviations of normal-to-normal heart rate peaks during persuasive principles compared to baseline or startle reflex. Results show no relation between cardiovascular arousal and self-reported susceptibility to persuasion. However, during the presentation of authority-based persuasion messages, data of the first stimulus condition showed a negative correlation between self-reported susceptibility and inter-beat interval reactivity. This explorative study advances our knowledge of psychophysiological processes underlying persuasion and suggested that at least certain persuasive principles may relate to physiological changes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10809 LNCS,,267-278,,10.1007/978-3-319-78978-1_22,,#6108,Spelt 2018,,,0

Using argumentative structure to grade persuasive essays,"Stiegelmayr, A.; Mieskes, M.","In this work we analyse a set of persuasive essays, which were marked and graded with respect to their overall quality. Additionally, we performed a small-scale machine learning experiment incorporating features from the argumentative analysis in order to automatically classify good and bad essays on a four-point scale. Our results indicate that bad essays suffer from more than just incomplete argument structures, which is already visible using simple surface features. We show that good essays distinguish themselves in terms of the amount of argumentative elements (such as major claims, premises, etc.) they use. The results, which have been obtained using a small corpus of essays in German, indicate that information about the argumentative structure of a text is helpful in distinguishing good and bad essays. © 2018, The Author(s).",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10713 LNAI,,301-308,,10.1007/978-3-319-73706-5_26,,#6110,Stiegelmayr 2018,,,0
A fully automated conversational artificial intelligence for weight loss: Longitudinal observational study among overweight and obese adults,"Stein, N.; Brooks, K.","Background: Type 2 diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the United States. Two-thirds of US adults have prediabetes or are overweight and at risk for type 2 diabetes. Intensive in-person behavioral counseling can help patients lose weight and make healthy behavior changes to improve their health outcomes. However, with the shortage of health care providers and associated costs, such programs do not adequately service all patients who could benefit. The health care system needs effective and cost-effective interventions that can lead to positive health outcomes as scale. This study investigated the ability of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of a standalone, fully automated text-based mobile coaching service, to promote weight loss and other health behaviors related to diabetes prevention. This study also measured user acceptability of AI coaches as alternatives to live health care professionals. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate weight loss, changes in meal quality, and app acceptability among users of the Lark Weight Loss Health Coach AI (HCAI), with the overarching goal of increasing access to compassionate health care via mobile health. Lessons learned in this study can be applied when planning future clinical trials to evaluate HCAI and when designing AI to promote weight loss, healthy behavior change, and prevention and self-management of chronic diseases. Methods: This was a longitudinal observational study among overweight and obese (body mass index ≥25) participants who used HCAI, which encourages weight loss and healthy diet choices through elements of cognitive behavioral therapy. Weight loss, meal quality, physical activity, and sleep data were collected through user input and, for sleep and physical activity, partly through automatic detection by the user's mobile phone. User engagement was assessed by duration and amount of app use. A 4-question in-app user trust survey assessed app usability and acceptability. Results: Data were analyzed for participants (N=70) who met engagement standards set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for Diabetes Prevention Program, a clinically proven weight loss program focused on preventing diabetes. Weight loss (standard error of the mean) was 2.38% (0.69%) of baseline weight. The average duration of app use was 15 (SD 1.0) weeks, and users averaged 103 sessions each. Predictors of weight loss included duration of AI use, number of counseling sessions, and number of meals logged. Percentage of healthy meals increased by 31%. The in-app user trust survey had a 100% response rate and positive results, with a satisfaction score of 87 out of 100 and net promoter score of 47. Conclusions: This study showed that use of an AI health coach is associated with weight loss comparable to in-person lifestyle interventions. It can also encourage behavior changes and have high user acceptability. Research into AI and its application in telemedicine should be pursued, with clinical trials investigating effects on weight, health behaviors, and user engagement and acceptability. © Natalie Stein, Kevin Brooks.

How can digital technology and information provided by digital technology make cities playful, allow citizens to engage in playful and entertaining activities that help to enjoy their daily and sometimes boring activities such as travelling, working, child care, house-keeping? This paper investigates how sensors and actuators in an urban environment can be introduced and used to design playful applications. We observe how ideas about playable cities emerge and develop.

"Prediction, persuasion, and the jurisprudence of behaviourism","Pasquale, F.; Cashwell, G.","There is a growing literature critiquing the unreflective application of big data, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine-learning techniques to social problems. Such methods may reflect biases rather than reasoned decision making. They also may leave those affected by automated sorting and categorizing unable to understand the basis of the decisions affecting them. Despite these problems, machinelearning experts are feeding judicial opinions to algorithms to predict how future cases will be decided. We call the use of such predictive analytics in judicial contexts a jurisprudence of behaviourism as it rests on a fundamentally Skinnerian model of cognition as a black-boxed transformation of inputs into outputs. In this model, persuasion is passé; what matters is prediction. After describing and critiquing a recent study that has advanced this jurisprudence of behaviourism, we question the value of such research. Widespread deployment of prediction models not based on the meaning of important precedents and facts may endanger the core rule-of-law values. © 2018 University Of Toronto Press.",2018,,University of Toronto Law Journal,68,,63-81,,10.3138/utlj.2017-0056,,#6115,Pasquale 2018,,,0
SIGIR 2018 workshop on ExplainAble Recommendation and Search (EARS 2018),"Zhang, Y.; Zhang, M.","Explainable recommendation and search attempt to develop models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also intuitive explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help to improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc. This is even more important in personalized search and recommendation scenarios, where users would like to know why a particular product, web page, news report, or friend suggestion exists in his or her own search and recommendation lists. The motivation of the workshop is to promote the research and application of Explainable Recommendation and Search, under the background of Explainable AI in a more general sense. Early recommendation and search systems adopted intuitive yet easily explainable models to generate recommendation and search lists, such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering for recommendation, which provide recommendations based on similar users or items, or TF-IDF based retrieval models for search, which provide document ranking lists according to word similarity between different documents. However, state-of-the-art recommendation and search models extensively rely on complex machine learning and latent representation models such as matrix factorization or even deep neural networks, and they work with various types of information sources such as ratings, text, images, audio or video signals. The complexity nature of state-of-the-art models make search and recommendation systems as blank-boxes for end users, and the lack of explainability weakens the persuasiveness and trustworthiness of the system for users, making explainable recommendation and search important research issues to the IR community. In a broader sense, researchers in the whole artificial intelligence community have also realized the importance of Explainable AI, which aims to address a wide range of AI explainability problems in deep learning, computer vision, automatic driving systems, and natural language processing tasks. As an important branch of AI research, this further highlights the importance and urgency for our IR/RecSys community to address the explainability issues of various recommendation and search systems. © 2018 ACM.",2018,,"41st International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2018",,,1411-1413,,10.1145/3209978.3210193,,#6116,Zhang 2018,,,0
"Whately on authority, deference, presumption and burden of proof","Walton, D.; Koszowy, M.","This paper shows how Whately’s view of presumption as a preoccupation of the ground plays an indispensable role in the study of persuasive aspects of appeals to authority and deference. This is done by showing how important connections among arguments from authority, presumption, burden of proof, and deference can be precisely defined, combined, and fitted into a formal argumentation framework for responding to arguments from expert opinion and analyzing the ad verecundiam fallacy. As the inquiry into Whately’s ideas also reveals links between Aristotelian topics and dialectic later brought out by Perelman, it constitutes an illustration showing how the study of various historically important rhetorical ideas allows us to develop contemporary models of arguments. © 2018 by The International Society for the History of Rhetoric.

Physical activity contagion and homophily in an adaptive social network model,"van Dijk, M.; Treur, J.","Regular physical activity contributes to higher levels of well-being, healthy aging and prevention of several chronic diseases such as depression. To establish or change behaviours concerning physical activity, social contagion may play a role. The aim of this study was to model the contagion of physical activity based on empirical Twitter data and to assess the role of homophily within this contagion. To model the contagion of physical activity, an adaptive temporal-causal network model was designed, and accordingly, the parameters of the model were tuned using empirical data obtained from Twitter. Two variants of the adaptive temporal-causal network model were created, in which one calculated the weights of the connections between the nodes based on follow relations on Twitter, while in the other the connection weights were modulated by the homophily principle. The results indicate that within the considered social network of already active persons homophily does not play an important role in the physical activity behaviour. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),11055 LNAI,,87-98,,10.1007/978-3-319-98443-8_9,,#6119,vanDijk 2018,,,0
The use of pseudoscience and experimentation as a persuasive resource in new advertising communication trends,"Moreno López, B.","Over the years, advertising communication has sought to use creativity to differentiate products and brands; using all possible resources available and with no hesitation in absorbing techniques and methods from different disciplines for the symbolic creation of values and perceptions. With the technological changes and developments in the last 15 years, advertising communication has evolved substantially to adapt to the new media arising in the digital environment. Thus not only the media have transformed but, consubstantially, the means of communicating, objectives and ways have evolved. This scenario has led to the emergence of various, apparently antagonistic, advertising trends. We can see the rise in new vintage trends that recover what is artisan and handmade, while campaigns are developed with increasingly technological applications (bots and new artificial intelligence, for example). These include a great tendency towards scientific and pseudoscientific justification. This not only involves applying neuromarketing to sales environments, but rather recovering old product demonstrations with brand values or understanding the insights applied to a creative concept. Advertising creativity recovered old psychological experiments used in the '60s and '70s, such as the marshmallow experiment, applying them to new creative proposals in special actions. In this way, psychological and sociological advertising experiments find a new way of using the product “demonstration”, or a “scientific” argument for the purchase, creating a brand image or promoting a change in attitude. This text analyses the most representative examples of this recently extended practice in order to analyze their characteristics, conceptualization and audiovisual production, so as to better understand the mechanisms used by the advertising sector to persuade and convince about certain changes in attitude. © 2018, University of La Laguna.

Addressing challenges in promoting healthy lifestyles: The Ai-Chatbot approach,"Fadhil, A.; Gabrielli, S.","Healthy lifestyles promotion is the main objective of primary care interventions, starting from the pediatric age, were overweight is nowadays exposing about one third of children to the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Recent years have seen a blast of mHealth apps for health promotion, targeting in particular nutrition and dietary behaviour change. However, reviews show difficulties in the adoption and effective usage of these applications in telemedicine and by the population in general, due to a lack of evidence-based content and strategies provided (e.g., by commercial apps) or lack of sufficient user engagement with the apps. Nutrition apps typically require self-reporting of food intake by the user which is often seen as a burden and a cause of abandonment of the app. However, current wave of research has taken up the challenge of promoting healthy lifestyles with advances in artificial intelligence (AI). This paper focus on AI chatbots as an innovative approach offering more simplicity and facilitating long-Term adherence to health promotion interventions. Conversational assistants provide the advantage of being deployed in smartphones and laptops within a wide variety of applications. We will particularly focus on harnessing the power of intelligent chatbot systems to provide behaviour change interventions in telemedicine for healthy lifestyle promotion. We describe an application scenario for an AI-chatbot delivering support to nutrition education that could help to overcome current limitations of similar mHealth solutions provided for healthy lifestyles and contribute to more effective public health interventions in this application domain. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",2017,,ACM International Conference Proceeding Series,,,261-265,,10.1145/3154862.3154914,,#6121,Fadhil 2017,,,0

Persuasive technology to support chronic health conditions: Investigating the optimal persuasive strategies for persons with COPD,"Wais-Zechmann, B.; Gattol, V.; Neureiter, K.; Orji, R.; Tscheligi, M.","Persuasive technology can support persons with chronic conditions to comply with their treatment plan. For persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), staying physically active is crucial to prevent deteriorations of their health status. However, most persons with COPD do not reach and maintain recommended levels of physical activity goals. Although COPD is expected to become the third most common cause of death worldwide, research on how to design persuasive systems for motivating specifically persons with COPD to engage in regular physical activity is still scarce. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study involving persons with COPD (n = 115) to investigate the perceived persuasiveness of 17 strategies (i.e., ratings of their concrete implementation) and individual susceptibility to persuasion (i.e., an underlying disposition to be more receptive to certain persuasive strategies). Based on our analysis, the following strategies were perceived as most persuasive: personalization, reminder, commitment, self-monitoring, rewards, customization, authority, and scarcity. Interestingly, the data revealed differences between perceived persuasiveness and individual susceptibility to persuasion, indicating that both constructs measure distinct aspects of persuasiveness. Our results are relevant to designers and developers of persuasive systems by providing valuable insights about the most promising persuasive strategies and their practical implementation when designing for persons with COPD. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",2018,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10809 LNCS,,255-266,,10.1007/978-3-319-78978-1_21,,#6125,Wais-Zechmann 2018,,,0
Argumentation Mining,"Stede, M.; Schneider, J.","Argumentation mining is an application of natural language processing (NLP) that emerged a few years ago and has recently enjoyed considerable popularity, as demonstrated by a series of international workshops and by a rising number of publications at the major conferences and journals of the field. Its goals are to identify argumentation in text or dialogue; to construct representations of the constellation of claims, supporting and attacking moves (in different levels of detail); and to characterize the patterns of reasoning that appear to license the argumentation. Furthermore, recent work also addresses the difficult tasks of evaluating the persuasiveness and quality of arguments. Some of the linguistic genres that are being studied include legal text, student essays, political discourse and debate, newspaper editorials, scientific writing, and others. The book starts with a discussion of the linguistic perspective, characteristics of argumentative language, and their relationship to certain other notions such as subjectivity. Besides the connection to linguistics, argumentation has for a long time been a topic in Artificial Intelligence, where the focus is on devising adequate representations and reasoning formalisms that capture the properties of argumentative exchange. It is generally very difficult to connect the two realms of reasoning and text analysis, but we are convinced that it should be attempted in the long term, and therefore we also touch upon some fundamentals of reasoning approaches. Then the book turns to its focus, the computational side of mining argumentation in text. We first introduce a number of annotated corpora that have been used in the research. From the NLP perspective, argumentation mining shares subtasks with research fields such as subjectivity and sentiment analysis, semantic relation extraction, and discourse parsing. Therefore, many technical approaches are being borrowed from those (and other) fields. We break argumentation mining into a series of subtasks, starting with the preparatory steps of classifying text as argumentative (or not) and segmenting it into elementary units. Then, central steps are the automatic identification of claims, and finding statements that support or oppose the claim. For certain applications, it is also of interest to compute a full structure of an argumentative constellation of statements. Next, we discuss a few steps that try to 'dig deeper': to infer the underlying reasoning pattern for a textual argument, to reconstruct unstated premises (so-called 'enthymemes'), and to evaluate the quality of the argumentation. We also take a brief look at 'the other side' of mining, i.e., the generation or synthesis of argumentative text. The book finishes with a summary of the argumentation mining tasks, a sketch of potential applications, and a-necessarily subjective-outlook for the field. © 2019 by Morgan & Claypool.",2018,,Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies,11,2,1-191,,10.2200/S00883ED1V01Y201811HLT040,,#6126,Stede 2018,,,0
The difficult legacy of Turing’s wager,"Thwaites, A.; Soltan, A.; Wieser, E.; Nimmo-Smith, I.","Describing the human brain in mathematical terms is an important ambition of neuroscience research, yet the challenges remain considerable. It was Alan Turing, writing in 1950, who first sought to demonstrate how time-consuming such an undertaking would be. Through analogy to the computer program, Turing argued that arriving at a complete mathematical description of the mind would take well over a thousand years. In this opinion piece, we argue that — despite seventy years of progress in the field — his arguments remain both prescient and persuasive. © 2017, The Author(s).",2017,,Journal of Computational Neuroscience,43,1,01-Apr,,10.1007/s10827-017-0651-y,,#6127,Thwaites 2017,,,0
Argument mining for improving the automated scoring of persuasive essays,"Nguyen, H.V.; Litman, D.J.","End-to-end argument mining has enabled the development of new automated essay scoring (AES) systems that use argumentative features (e.g., number of claims, number of support relations) in addition to traditional legacy features (e.g., grammar, discourse structure) when scoring persuasive essays. While prior research has proposed different argumentative features as well as empirically demonstrated their utility for AES, these studies have all had important limitations. In this paper we identify a set of desiderata for evaluating the use of argument mining for AES, introduce an end-to-end argument mining system and associated argumentative feature sets, and present the results of several studies that both satisfy the desiderata and demonstrate the value-added of argument mining for scoring persuasive essays.

Sustainability disclosure in integrated reporting: Does it matter to investors? A cheap talk approach,"Camodeca, R.; Almici, A.; Sagliaschi, U.","The purpose of this study is to investigate the value-relevance of corporate sustainability disclosure through integrated reporting. Sustainability disclosure is subject to managers' discretion. Besides, it is often hardly verifiable. In this respect, integrated reporting could provide the means for a verifiable disclosure, otherwise, in the jargon of game theory, it could be considered as a cheap talk. This paper investigates which of these hypotheses is most likely to occur in reality. In order to do this, a simple theoretical framework is introduced, where sustainability of corporate performances is modelled as a tail-risk for shareholders. Costless signaling games (cheap talk) and persuasion games are reviewed within this context, in order to derive competing theories of sustainability disclosure's value relevance through integrated reporting. These alternative theories are tested empirically consistent with the theoretical framework presented, in order to identify key-parameters. In this respect, a systematic textual analysis (artificial intelligence) of integrated reports was employed as to build a synthetic measure of sustainability disclosure. The application of this methodology on a sample of European listed companies showed that sustainability disclosure through integrated reporting has no effect on market-valuations, confirming the null hypothesis of integrated reporting resulting in a cheap talk's babbling equilibrium. © 2018 by the authors.",2018,,Sustainability (Switzerland),10,12,,,10.3390/su10124393,,#6129,Camodeca 2018,,,0
Evaluation of ensemble machine learning methods in mobile threat detection,"Kumar, S.; Viinikainen, A.; Hamalainen, T.","The rapid growing trend of mobile devices continues to soar causing massive increase in cyber security threats. Most pervasive threats include ransom-ware, banking malware, premium SMS fraud. The solitary hackers use tailored techniques to avoid detection by the traditional antivirus. The emerging need is to detect these threats by any flow-based network solution. Therefore, we propose and evaluate a network based model which uses ensemble Machine Learning (ML) methods in order to identify the mobile threats, by analyzing the network flows of the malware communication. The ensemble ML methods not only protect over-fitting of the model but also cope with the issues related to the changing behavior of the attackers. The focus of this study is on android based mobile malwares due to its popularity among users. We have used ensemble methods to combine output of 5 supervised ML algorithms such as RF, PART, JRIP, J.48 and Ridor.

"Developing a virtual coach for chronic patients: A user study on the impact of similarity, familiarity and realism","van Wissen, A.; Vinkers, C.; van Halteren, A.","Healthcare costs are increasing dramatically due to disproportional consumption of healthcare resources by chronic patients. Automated forms of health coaching can contribute to improved patient self-management while reducing costs due to increased scalability and availability of the use of human health coaches. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) seem to be good candidates to function as automated coaches, as they introduce a social component to human-computer interactions which makes them particularly suitable to influence a user’s attitude or behavior. To date, there is limited knowledge on the impact of appearance-related characteristics of an ECA as a virtual coach among a chronically ill elderly population. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of three appearance cues on user acceptance: (i) similarity; (ii) familiarity; and (iii) realism. Findings demonstrate that patients (a) preferred the realistic-looking ECA over the more stylized one; (b) showed no preference for the familiar over the unfamiliar ECAs (but did evaluate the unfamiliar ECAs as more positive than the familiar one); and (c) evaluated an ECA as virtual coach for self-management support as useful. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9638,,263-275,,10.1007/978-3-319-31510-2_23,,#6132,vanWissen 2016,,,0
Logical representation and analysis for RC-arguments,"Amgoud, L.; Besnard, P.; Hunter, A.","An argument is seen as reason in favour of a claim. It is made of three parts: a set of premises representing the reason, a conclusion representing the supported claim, and a connection showing how the premises lead to the conclusion. Arguments are frequently exchanged by human agents in natural language (spoken or written) in discussion, debate, negotiation, persuasion, etc. They may be very different in that their three components may have various forms. In this paper, we propose a language for representing such arguments. We show that it is general enough to capture the various forms of arguments encountered in natural language, and that it is possible to represent attack and support relations between arguments as formulas of the same language. © 2015 IEEE.",2016,,"Proceedings - International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI",2016-January,,104-110,,10.1109/ICTAI.2015.28,,#6133,Amgoud 2016,,,0

Why do urban legends go viral?,"Guerini, M.; Strapparava, C.","Urban legends are a genre of modern folklore, consisting of stories about rare and exceptional events, just plausible enough to be believed, which tend to propagate inexorably across communities. In our view, while urban legends represent a form of ""sticky"" deceptive text, they are marked by a tension between the credible and incredible. They should be credible like a news article and incredible like a fairy tale to go viral. In particular we will focus on the idea that urban legends should mimic the details of news (who, where, when) to be credible, while they should be emotional and readable like a fairy tale to be catchy and memorable. Using NLP tools we will provide a quantitative analysis of these prototypical characteristics. We also lay out some machine learning experiments showing that it is possible to recognize an urban legend using just these simple features. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Smartphone based fall detection system,"Madansingh, S.; Thrasher, T.A.; Layne, C.S.; Lee, B.-C.","This paper describes the design of a smartphone based fall detection system and characterizes the preliminary efficacy of the proposed system in activities of daily living (ADLs). Using the embedded sensors available in a smartphone (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), kinematic analysis of movement can be performed in real-time, allowing for continuous monitoring of fall status. Fall sensing thresholds are defined based on angular rate of change (TH1), maximum acceleration (TH2), and maximum attitude change (TH3). TH1 is measured from the resultant pitch and roll angular velocity vector and defined as 3.1 rad/s (∼180°/s). TH2 is measured from the resultant acceleration vector and defined as 1.6 g. TH3 is measured from the resultant vector of the pitch and roll angles, and defined at 0.59 rad (39°). A proof-of-concept study was performed on five ADL tasks: 1) comfortable walking, 2) stand-to-seated posture, 3) seated-to-standing posture, 4) pivoting at the waist to pick up an object, and 5) stand-to-seated-to-laying transition. No trials violated the defined thresholds for fall detection, signifying no false positives.

Knowledge discovery of game design features by mining user-generated feedback,"Gopinath Bharathi, A.K.B.; Singh, A.; Tucker, C.S.; Nembhard, H.B.","The term ""Gamification"" is an emerging paradigm that aims to employ game mechanics and game thinking to change behavior. Gamification offers several effective ways to motivate users into action such as challenges, levels and rewards. However, an open research problem is discovering the set of gamification features that consistently result in a higher probability of success for a given task, game or application. The objective of this paper is to bridge this knowledge gap by quantifying the gamification features that are consistently found in successful applications. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers about the gamification features that lead to higher chances of an application's success, and the gamification features that do not significantly impact the success of an application. The case study presented in this work leverages demographic heterogeneity and scale of applications existing within mobile platforms to evaluate the impact of gamification features on the success or failure of those applications. The successful game design features identified have the potential to be embedded into interactive gamification platforms across various fields such as healthcare, education, military and marketing, in order to maintain or enhance user engagement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Incorporating persuasion into a decision support system: The case of the water user classification function,"Perren, K.; Yang, L.; He, J.; Yang, S.-H.; Shan, Y.","Utility stakeholders often view autonomic feedback systems as valuable tools for moderating consumption of household resources (e.g. electricity).

This function has been designed to harness personal value systems and wider social norms in order to promote water conservation. It uses data on home appliance efficiency, routine water usage and environmental values to attribute DSS users with a water user identity. Where the attributed identity is at odds with a self-defined 'green' identity, users may be prompted to reevaluate their everyday practices. The function also offers 'smart' personalized water saving advice. In these ways, it aims to encourage consumers to adopt sustainable water saving behaviors.

Captology and technology appropriation: Unintended use as a source for designing persuasive technologies,"Krischkowsky, A.; Maurer, B.; Tscheligi, M.","In this paper we theoretically reflect upon persuasive technology usage under the light of technology appropriation. The intended usage of technology often fails, meaning that the designers’ intended use is not always translated into user behavior. This is also true for persuasive technology, since technology will always be used within a context involving users’ own intentions that may not always be anticipated by designers. This clashes with Fogg’s framing of captology, which explicitly focuses on endogenous intent, i.e., a persuasive intent that is designed into a technology. With this paper we open up an initial theoretical discourse around these two concepts, highlighting how the design of persuasive technologies can be informed by existing knowledge around technology appropriation. This is done by reflecting upon three identified ‘action points’: (1) learning from appropriation, (2) designing for appropriation, and (3) designing for personal differences and ambiguity of interaction. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9638,,78-83,,10.1007/978-3-319-31510-2_7,,#6144,Krischkowsky 2016,,,0

The application of data clustering as a preprocessing step is also explored as a way to improve the prediction accuracy of resources whose behavior change over time.

An ontology to support knowledge management in behaviour-based healthcare,"Kingston, J.; Charlton, N.","A Do Something Different (DSD) behaviour change programme consists of a series of digitally delivered behavioural prompts, or “Dos”, for targeted behaviour change designed to aid people to achieve personal goals or to break bad habits. “Dos” may address for example behaviour connected with exercise, smoking, diet, sleep or diabetes self-management, or personal development objectives such as leadership. DSD’s current database contains thousands of such “Dos”, developed by behaviour change experts. We have developed an ontology to organise the large database of behavioural prompts in order to help DSD with its knowledge management. We began by developing an ontology of function, bottom-up; then we expanded this into a multi-perspective ontology covering WHO, WHAT, HOW, WHEN, WHERE and WHY perspectives. The expected benefits from our ontology are: 1. response data from users can be aggregated by ontology category to get insights into users’ behaviour, 2. the ontology enables the implementation of smarter algorithms for selecting which “Dos” to suggest to which users, and 3. the ontology assists in the process of generating new “Dos”, either by domain experts or by crowd-sourcing.

Modeling users' preferences and social links in social networking services: A joint-evolving perspective,"Wu, L.; Ge, Y.; Liu, Q.; Chen, E.; Long, B.; Huang, Z.","Researchers have long converged that the evolution of a Social Networking Service (SNS) platform is driven by the interplay between users' preferences (reflected in user-item consumption behavior) and the social network structure (reflected in user-user interaction behavior), with both kinds of users' behaviors change from time to time. However, traditional approaches either modeled these two kinds of behaviors in an isolated way or relied on a static assumption of a SNS. Thus, it is still unclear how do the roles of users' historical preferences and the dynamic social network structure affect the evolution of SNSs. Furthermore, can jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs benefit both behavior prediction tasks? In this paper, we leverage the underlying social theories (i.e., social influence and the homophily effect) to investigate the interplay and evolution of SNSs. We propose a probabilistic approach to fuse these social theories for jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs. Thus our proposed model has both the explanatory ability and predictive power.

Using dynamical systems tools to detect concept drift in data streams,"Da Costa, F.G.; Rios, R.A.; De Mello, R.F.","Real-world data streams may change their behaviors along time, what is referred to as concept drift. By detecting those changes, researchers obtain relevant information about the phenomena that produced such streams (e.g. temperatures in a region, bacteria population, disease occurrence, etc.). Many concept drift detection algorithms consider supervised or semi-supervised approaches which tend to be unfeasible when data is collected at high frequencies, due to the difficulties involved in labeling. Complementarily, current studies usually assume data as statistically independent and identically distributed, disregarding any temporal relationship among observations and, consequently, risking the quality of data modeling. In order to tackle both aspects, we employ dynamical system modeling to represent the temporal relationships among data observations and how they modify along time in attempt to detect concept drift. This approach considers Taken's immersion theorem to unfold consecutive windows of data observations into the phase space in attempt to represent and compare time dependencies. From this perspective, we proposed four new concept drift detection algorithms based on the unsupervised machine learning paradigm. The first algorithm builds dendrograms of consecutive phase spaces (every phase space represents the time relationships for the observations contained in a particular data window) and compare them out by using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, providing enough guarantees to detect concept drifts. The second algorithm employs the Cross Recurrence Plot and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis to detect relevant changes in consecutive phase spaces and warn about relevant data modifications. We also preprocess data windows by considering the Empirical Mode Decomposition method and Mutual Information in attempt to take only the deterministic stream behavior into account. All algorithms were implemented as plugins for the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) software and then compared to well-known algorithms from literature.

Persuasive practices: Learning from home security advisory services,"Dolata, M.; Comes, T.; Schenk, B.; Schwabe, G.","Research on persuasive technologies (PT) focuses, primarily, on the design and development of IT for inducing change of individual’s behavior and attitude through computer-human and computer-mediated influence. The issue of practices in co-located human-human persuasive encounters remained unattended in the PT community. This study uses the notion of persuasive practices to understand the course of events in face-to-face home security advisory sessions – it specifies and illustrates such practices and discusses their impact on the persuasiveness of the encounter. Furthermore, it presents potential of IT to support such persuasive practices thus opening new research possibilities of PT research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9638,,176-188,,10.1007/978-3-319-31510-2_15,,#6153,Dolata 2016,,,0
Deconstructing Pokémon Go – An empirical study on player personality characteristics,"Mattheiss, E.; Hochleitner, C.; Busch, M.; Orji, R.; Tscheligi, M.","Pokémon Go can be considered a successful persuasive game to promote physical activity. This study provides an in-depth analysis of Pokémon Go players’ characteristics that relate to adoption and continued play of the game. Based on online studies at two different points in time (at the initial release and three months later) we analyzed differences in personality traits between players and non-players, as well as between players who continued playing the game and those who stopped playing. The results show that people who played the game score lower in “Conscientiousness” and higher in “Player Motivation” than non-players. Furthermore, people who continued playing the game three months later have a lower score in “Neuroticism” than those who stopped playing. Insights into player characteristics from our empirical analysis of Pokémon Go contribute to answering the key research question regarding to which personality characteristics the persuasive game experience should be personalized. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10171 LNCS,,83-94,,10.1007/978-3-319-55134-0_7,,#6154,Mattheiss 2017,,,0
Data driven physical modelling for intrusion detection in cyber physical systems,"Junejo, K.N.; Yau, D.","Cyber physical systems are critical to the infrastructure of a country. They are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their use of off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on World Wide Web for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network security, he can affect the operations of the system which may even lead to a catastrophe. Mathematical and formal models try to detect the departure of the system from its expected behaviour but are difficult to build, and are sensitive to noise. Furthermore they take a lot of time to detect the attack. We here propose a behaviour based machine learning intrusion detection approach that quickly detects attacks at the physical process layer. We validate our result on a complete replicate of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment facility. Our approach is fast, scalable, robust to noise, and exhibits a low false positive (FP) rate with high precision and recall. The model can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and environment. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.",2016,,Cryptology and Information Security Series,14,,43-57,,10.3233/978-1-61499-617-0-43,,#6155,Junejo 2016,,,0

Investigating politeness strategies and their persuasiveness for a Robotic Elderly Assistant,"Hammer, S.; Lugrin, B.; Bogomolov, S.; Janowski, K.; André, E.","This work is targeted towards the development of a Robotic Elderly Assistant (REA) system that provides assistance in the form of recommendations to support single-living elderly people in their domestic environment. To avoid potential face threats the REA should be as polite as possible whilst keeping a certain persuasiveness to promote its recommendations. This paper investigates different verbalizations of the REA’s recommendations regarding their perceived politeness as well as their persuasiveness. We present the results of a laboratory study with younger adults and a user study with the inhabitants of a retirement home. Results suggest that the different politeness strategies reflected different levels of politeness in both studies, while their perceived persuasiveness needs further investigation in the domain of elderly care. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9638,,315-326,,10.1007/978-3-319-31510-2_27,,#6157,Hammer 2016,,,0
Improving argument mining in student essays by learning and exploiting argument indicators versus essay topics,"Nguyen, H.; Litman, D.","Argument mining systems for student essays need to be able to reliably identify argument components independently of particular essay topics. Thus in addition to features that model argumentation through topic-independent linguistic indicators such as discourse markers, features that can abstract over lexical signals of particular essay topics might also be helpful to improve performance. Prior argument mining studies have focused on persuasive essays and proposed a variety of largely lexicalized features. Our current study examines the utility of such features, proposes new features to abstract over the domain topics of essays, and conducts evaluations using both 10-fold cross validation as well as cross-topic validation. Experimental results show that our proposed features significantly improve argument mining performance in both types of cross-fold evaluation settings. Feature ablation studies further shed light on relative feature utility. Copyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Analyzing the influence of virtuality on playful social interaction,"Sakamoto, M.; Alexandrova, T.; Nakajima, T.","Ambient intelligence technologies are making our daily life increasingly virtual, and the boundary between the real world and the virtual world is gradually disappearing. Computer games are often played on the Internet, which allows people to enjoy games with others, even when they are not at the same location. This paper analyzes the Trading Card Game (TCG), which has two versions. One version is played with paper-based cards, whereas the other is played on a computer. The computer-based TCG supports remote play and has a number of enhancements, such as providing special fictional effects on virtual cards. The two different versions are useful to analyze the influence of virtuality in making future social interaction more playful. First, we investigate potential pitfalls to introduce virtuality in TCG through the scenario-based analysis, which adopts a player’s personality to exploit potential difficulties. For investigating further insights on the influence of virtuality in TCG, we analyze some experiments with Augmented Trading Card Game, where a real opponent player is replaced with a fictional player. Our findings from the analyses show that the feeling of realness is essential to make incorporated virtuality successful. Recently some games’ concepts can be adopted in order to augment our real world. It is essential to investigate the influence of virtuality introduced with the games. The future social interaction will incorporate virtuality based on a variety of game-like features to make the interaction more playful. Therefore, the insights described in this paper will be useful to help the design of future playful social interaction. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.",2016,,Multimedia Tools and Applications,75,14,8289-8317,,10.1007/s11042-015-2751-x,,#6159,Sakamoto 2016,,,0
Is a holistic criteria-based approach possible in user experience?: Study of the classification of 58 criteria linked to UX,"Urrutia, J.I.G.; Brangier, E.; Cessat, L.","After having produced many criteria to improve accessibility, ease of use, emotions linked to interactions, persuasive design, cultural values attached to systems, socio-organizational contexts, the domain of HCI must conduct a reflection on the structuring of these criteria. The aim of this paper is to advance research in the field of user experience criteria by understanding how UX professionals organize their cognitions around the criteria set. For this, we conducted a study of its classification with 17 experts. The set of 58 cards was presented by explaining that each card represents a criterion. The experts were asked to do an open card sort, to name the groups of cards and, upon completion, to explain the logic they had based their sorting on. On the basis of several statistical analyzes, the results show a categorization into 8 main classes: (1) Utility (task-system suitability, achieving the goal, efficacy) and Pragmatism (ergonomic criteria, efficiency); (2) Hedonism, Pleasure, Emotions; (3) Persuasion, Incitement, Pervasive design; (4) Emotional & Cognitive Stimulation for self-development; (5) Marketing strategy/Customer Relationship Management; (6) Security/Reliability-User’s protection; (7) Organizational factors; and (8) Social, moral and/or cultural factors.

Personal ICT ecosystem to promote habits that improve sleep quality,"Hernández, A.J.L.; Briseño, M.V.","Poor sleep quality can cause diverse deficiencies in mental and physical health. Several information and communication technologies (ICT) systems have been developed to improve sleep quality, most of which monitor patterns in sleep epochs to determine the quality of sleep.

Our work considers the integration of technology (hardware and software) to obtain data related to sleep hygiene habits.

Commitment devices as behavior change support systems: A study of users’ perceived competence and continuance intention,"Oduor, M.; Oinas-Kukkonen, H.","The design principles of persuasive systems and the corresponding software features have been shown to have a positive effect on individuals’ behavior and systems use. This study continues along the same line by analyzing the effects of these design principles on users’ perceived competence and intention to continue to use an online commitment device. A structural equation modelling approach is used to identify the factors that affect the intention to continue to use the system. Data (N = 173) collected from the system’s users is tested against the proposed research model. The results show that 37% of users’ continuance intention is explained by the implemented persuasive software feature categories (computer–human dialogue support, primary task support, perceived credibility, and social support) and perceived competence. Of these categories, primary task support has the strongest effect on perceived competence and continuance intention.

A parametrized ranking-based semantics for persuasion,"Bonzon, E.; Delobelle, J.; Konieczny, S.; Maudet, N.","In this paper we question the ability of the existant ranking semantics for argumentation to capture persuasion settings, emphasizing in particular the phenomena of protocatalepsis (the fact that it is often efficient to anticipate the counter-arguments of the audience), and of fading (the fact that long lines of argumentation become ineffective). It turns out that some widely accepted principles of ranking-based semantics are incompatible with a faithful treatment of these phenomena. We thus propose a parametrized semantics based on propagation of values, which allows to control the scope of arguments to be considered for evaluation. We investigate its properties (identifying in particular threshold values guaranteeing that some properties hold), and report experimental results showing that the family of rankings that may be returned have a high coherence rate. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10564 LNAI,,237-251,,10.1007/978-3-319-67582-4_17,,#6164,Bonzon 2017,,,0
Supporting users in setting effective goals in activity tracking,"Herrmanny, K.; Ziegler, J.; Dogangün, A.","In this paper we present the development of the pedometer app Move My Day which implements goal setting as its main persuasive design principle. Manual goal input as well as two strategies to support users in setting realistic goals, namely reference routes and personal goal recommendation, were implemented. The proposed algorithm for adaptive personal goal recommendation is designed in a way that it recommends short-term goals considering motivational aspects and gradually raises goals in the long term to meet physical activity recommendations. In a 12 week field study, we investigated the potentials of the two support strategies. Results indicate that about half of the users appreciate goal setting support and that especially personal goal recommendation seems to have potential to support users in setting effective physical activity goals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9638,,15-26,,10.1007/978-3-319-31510-2_2,,#6165,Herrmanny 2016,,,0
CoFELS: Conceptual Framework for Electricity Load Shifting System Design,"Kim, J.M.; Jacobsen, R.H.; Brewer, R.S.","The realization of the smart grid depends critically on the successful engagement of consumers in adapting their energy consumption behavior to the intermittent generation of renewable energy. The engaged consumers participate in demand response programs in which they provide a shift of electricity consumption based on incentives provided. However, understanding the concept of load shifting and the decision when to shift consumption is quite complex for most consumers and it may interfere with daily practices leading to inconveniences. Therefore, there is a strong need for efficient decision-support systems to help consumers to shift or not to shift electricity consumption. This paper presents a conceptual framework aimed at system designers and developers of electricity load shifting applications. The framework is validated by implementation of a prototype that provides planning and decision support for consumers. The prototype provides insight into possible load shifting capability by providing feedback on the CO2 emission intensity of energy production, thus encouraging consumers to change behavior and consume energy in a more sustainable way. © 2016 IEEE.",2016,,"Proceedings - 19th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design, DSD 2016",,,268-275,,10.1109/DSD.2016.48,,#6166,Kim 2016,,,0
Strategical argumentative agent for human persuasion,"Rosenfeld, A.; Kraus, S.","Automated agents should be able to persuade people in the same way people persuade each other - via dialogs. Today, automated persuasion modeling and research use unnatural assumptions regarding persuasive interaction, which creates doubt regarding their applicability for real-world deployment with people. In this work we present a novel methodology for persuading people through argumentative dialogs. Our methodology combines theoretical argumentation modeling, machine learning and Markovian optimization techniques that together result in an innovative agent named SPA. Two extensive field experiments, with more than 100 human subjects, show that SPA is able to persuade people significantly more often than a baseline agent and no worse than people are able to persuade each other. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.",2016,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,285,,320-328,,10.3233/978-1-61499-672-9-320,,#6167,Rosenfeld 2016,,,0
Learning to coordinate with deep reinforcement learning in doubles pong game,"Diallo, E.A.O.; Sugiyama, A.; Sugawara, T.","This paper discusses the emergence of cooperative and coordinated behaviors between joint and concurrent learning agents using deep Q-learning. Multi-agent systems (MAS) arise in a variety of domains. The collective effort is one of the main building blocks of many fundamental systems that exist in the world, and thus, sequential decision making under uncertainty for collaborative work is one of the important and challenging issues for intelligent cooperative multiple agents. However, the decisions for cooperation are highly sophisticated and complicated because agents may have a certain shared goal or individual goals to achieve and their behavior is inevitably influenced by each other. Therefore, we attempt to explore whether agents using deep Q-networks (DQN) can learn cooperative behavior. We use doubles pong game as an example and we investigate how they learn to divide their works through iterated game executions. In our approach, agents jointly learn to divide their area of responsibility and each agent uses its own DQN to modify its behavior. We also investigate how learned behavior changes according to environmental characteristics including reward schemes and learning techniques. Our experiments indicate that effective cooperative behaviors with balanced division of workload emerge. These results help us to better understand how agents behave and interact with each other in complex environments and how they coherently choose their individual actions such that the resulting joint actions are optimal. © 2017 IEEE.",2017,,"Proceedings - 16th IEEE International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications, ICMLA 2017",2017-December,,14-19,,10.1109/ICMLA.2017.0-184,,#6168,Diallo 2017,,,0

A Review and Future Perspectives of Arabic Question Answering Systems,"Ray, S.K.; Shaalan, K.","Question Answering Systems (QASs) have emerged as a good alternative for information seekers to retrieve precise information over the Internet. A good amount of research has been done to improve the performance of QASs across several languages, including European and Asian languages. However, Arabic, a morphologically rich Semitic language spoken by over 422 million people, has not seen similar development in the field of question answering. This article reviews the developments taking place in Arabic QASs as well as the challenges faced by researchers in developing Arabic QASs. After conducting an extensive literature survey of a number of English and Arabic QASs, this article classifies them according to several criteria. The most commonly used architecture for the development of an Arabic QAS, known as pipeline architecture, has been presented. In order to encourage and support the new researchers and scholars in conducting research in Arabic QASs, a list of techniques, tools, and computational linguistic resources, required to implement the components of the presented pipelined architecture, are described in this article in a simple and persuasive manner. Finally, the gap analysis between the research in Arabic and English QASs has been performed and accordingly, some future directions for research in Arabic QASs have been proposed. © 1989-2012 IEEE.",2016,,IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering,28,12,3169-3190,,10.1109/TKDE.2016.2607201,,#6170,Ray 2016,,,0
Automatic mapping of motivational text messages into ontological entities for smart coaching applications,"Villalonga, C.; den Akker, H.; Hermens, H.; Herrera, L.J.; Pomares, H.; Rojas, I.; Valenzuela, O.; Banos, O.","Unwholesome lifestyles can reduce lifespan by several years or even decades. Therefore, raising awareness and promoting healthier behaviors prove essential to revert this dramatic panorama. Virtual coaching systems are at the forefront of digital solutions to educate people and procure a more effective health self-management. Despite their increasing popularity, virtual coaching systems are still regarded as entertainment applications with an arguable efficacy for changing behaviors, since messages can be perceived to be boring, unpersonalized and can become repetitive over time. In fact, messages tend to be quite general, repetitive and rarely tailored to the specific needs, preferences and conditions of each user. In the light of these limitations, this work aims at help building a new generation of methods for automatically generating user-tailored motivational messages. While the creation of messages is addressed in a previous work, in this paper the authors rather present a method to automatically extract the semantics of motivational messages and to create the ontological representation of these messages. The method uses first natural language processing to perform a linguistic analysis of the message. The extracted information is then mapped to the concepts of the motivational messages ontology. The proposed method could boost the quantity and diversity of messages by automatically mining and parsing existing messages from the internet or other digitised sources, which can be later tailored according to the specific needs and particularities of each user. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10586 LNCS,,340-351,,10.1007/978-3-319-67585-5_36,,#6171,Villalonga 2017,,,0
Adapting healthy eating messages to personality,"Thomas, R.J.; Masthoff, J.; Oren, N.","This paper considers how persuasive messages – within the healthy eating domain – should be communicated to individuals with different personality types. Following a personality assessment, subjects imagined themselves in a scenario and evaluated the effectiveness of messages constructed using Cialdini’s principles of persuasion. Our results suggest that messages exploiting the principle of authority are the most effective across a range of personality types. In addition, personality had a statistically significant impact on the persuasiveness of messages, with “conscientious” subjects more willing to be persuaded than others. Finally, we found that positively framed messages were more preferred than negatively ones.

Using Artificial Intelligence to Reduce the Risk of Nonadherence in Patients on Anticoagulation Therapy,"Labovitz, D.L.; Shafner, L.; Reyes Gil, M.; Virmani, D.; Hanina, A.","Background and Purpose - This study evaluated the use of an artificial intelligence platform on mobile devices in measuring and increasing medication adherence in stroke patients on anticoagulation therapy. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants, while reducing the need for monitoring, have also placed pressure on patients to self-manage. Suboptimal adherence goes undetected as routine laboratory tests are not reliable indicators of adherence, placing patients at increased risk of stroke and bleeding. Methods - A randomized, parallel-group, 12-week study was conducted in adults (n=28) with recently diagnosed ischemic stroke receiving any anticoagulation. Patients were randomized to daily monitoring by the artificial intelligence platform (intervention) or to no daily monitoring (control). The artificial intelligence application visually identified the patient, the medication, and the confirmed ingestion. Adherence was measured by pill counts and plasma sampling in both groups. Results - For all patients (n=28), mean (SD) age was 57 years (13.2 years) and 53.6% were women. Mean (SD) cumulative adherence based on the artificial intelligence platform was 90.5% (7.5%). Plasma drug concentration levels indicated that adherence was 100% (15 of 15) and 50% (6 of 12) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Conclusions - Patients, some with little experience using a smartphone, successfully used the technology and demonstrated a 50% improvement in adherence based on plasma drug concentration levels. For patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants, absolute improvement increased to 67%. Real-time monitoring has the potential to increase adherence and change behavior, particularly in patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",2017,,Stroke,48,5,1416-1419,,10.1161/STROKEAHA.116.016281,,#6176,Labovitz 2017,,,0
A bare bones particle swarm optimization algorithm with dynamic local search,"Guo, J.; Sato, Y.","Swarm intelligence algorithms are wildly used in different areas. The bare bones particle swarm optimization (BBPSO) is one of them. In the BBPSO, the next position of a particle is chosen from the Gaussian distribution. However, all particles learning from the only global best particle may cause the premature convergence and rapid diversity-losing. Thus, a BBPSO with dynamic local search (DLS-BBPSO) is proposed to solve these problems. Also, because the blind setting of local group may cause the time complexity an unpredictable increase, a dynamic strategy is used in the process of local group creation to avoid this situation. Moreover, to confirm the searching ability of the proposed algorithm, a set of well-known benchmark functions are used in the experiments. Both unimodal and multimodal functions are considered to enhance the persuasion of the test. Meanwhile, the BBPSO and several other evolutionary algorithms are used as the control group. At last, the results of the experiment confirm the searching ability of the proposed algorithm in the test functions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10385 LNCS,,158-165,,10.1007/978-3-319-61824-1_17,,#6177,Guo 2017,,,0

First, linguistic indices derived from automatic text analysis tools were used to predict human categorizations of utterances for humor and persuasion in a corpus of natural dialogue produced during a creative problem-solving and divergent thinking task. Four linguistic indices related to the use of function words, word age-of-acquisition, and spoken word frequency distinguished humor and persuasion with approximately 50% accuracy. These linguistic features, along with incidence scores for humorous and persuasive categories based on human ratings per dialogue were then used to predict human ratings of creativity and elaboration from the same corpus. Less variation in use of function words significantly predicted both creativity and elaboration scores, and lower spoken word frequency and higher incidences of humorous utterances significantly predicted creativity scores. These results demonstrate the potential for linguistic features to explain creativity and elaboration and highlight connections between humor, persuasion, and creativity.

Unsupervised detection of unusual behaviors from smart home energy data,"Pereira, W.; Ferscha, A.; Weigl, K.","In this paper the potentials of identifying unusual user behaviors and changes of behavior from smart home energy meters are investigated. We compare the performance of the classical change detection Page-Hinkley test (PHT) with a new application of a self-adaptive stream clustering algorithm to detect novelties related to the time of use of appliances at home. With the use of annotated data, the true positive rate of the clustering-based method outperformed the PHT by at least 20%. Moreover the method was able to identify behavior changes related to time shifts and replacement of appliances. The motivation for this study is based on the need for identifying and guiding behavior changes that can reduce energy consumption, and use this knowledge in the development of systems that can raise just-in-time warnings to save energy (e.g. avoid stand-by modes), and guide sustainable behavior changes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9693,,523-534,,10.1007/978-3-319-39384-1_46,,#6181,Pereira 2016,,,0
Cognitive cybernetics vs. captology,"Balaž, Z.; Predavec, D.","In acronym Captology - Computers as Persuasive Technology, a persuasive component (lat. persuasibilibus - enticing) refers to the persuasive stimulation by intelligent technologies. Latter being transitive and interactive as intelligent systems, they have imposed, by their persuasivity, a ‘cult of information’, after which information has become a type of goods that as a utilitarian resource must be exploited quickly and efficiently. Such a widely accepted fact resulted as hype, presenting a perspective that the approach to a large amount of information and faster ‘digestion’ of their content will enable users to quickly get desired knowledge. Recent investigations about persuasion processes have shown its dependence on intelligent technology factors (design, interactive computer products, web, desktop and others). Such technologies are also used to influence people's attitudes, beliefs, learning, and behaviour. Development strategies for global computer production and sales head in that direction and confirm latter statement with the promoted 3-P model: persuasive, permissive and pervasive components. Cognitive level of human integrated development is increasingly overshadowed by the contribution of artificial intelligence through its products, i.e. ‘smart’ creations, and by the array of shortcomings and problems that the same interactive technology brings. This paper presents a parallel between captological component of intelligent and interactive technologies on one side and illustrates examples of captological influences proved by confirmed trials within cognitive science through computer simulations of human thinking on the other side. Many studies have shown that the success of persuasion depends on the factors which have been exposed by cognitive cybernetics. Next to it, people’s behavior system is transforming through the very development of society. Therefore, the influence of latter can be either positive or negative, while its extremes are already escalating in direction of a new trans-singularity and post humanism theories based on the principles of extropy. © 2017 ASTES Publishers.

Persuasive technology against public nuisance – Public urination in the urban nightlife district,"Bloeme, R.; de Vries, P.; Galetzka, M.; van Soomeren, P.","Assumptions of the goal framing theory are applied to the specific context of a nightlife environment. Focusing on public urination as specific and often occurring antisocial behaviour in nightlife environments, this research explored how choice behaviour of potential public urinators can be influenced in a positive way. One boundary condition was to intervene in choice behaviour without negatively affecting the widely appreciated attractive and stimulating character of nightlife environments. Five experimental forms of nudging and priming are conducted to facilitate alternative social behaviour and to further stimulate potential public urinators to perform social behaviour. This was done by activating positive emotions, presenting visible and accessible alternatives and influencing subjective norms. Facilitating social behaviour reduced public urination by 41%, while additional interventions reduced public urination up to 67%. The results contribute to an extension of goal framing theory to specific contexts like nightlife environments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10171 LNCS,,187-198,,10.1007/978-3-319-55134-0_15,,#6183,Bloeme 2017,,,0
Driver-Behavior Modeling Using On-Road Driving Data: A new application for behavior signal processing,"Miyajima, C.; Takeda, K.","This article reviews data-centric approaches for statistical modeling of driver behavior. Modeling driver behavior is challenging due to its stochastic nature and the high degree of inter- and intradriver variability. One way to deal with the highly variable nature of driving behavior is to employ a data-centric approach that models driver behavior using large amounts of driving data collected from numerous drivers in a variety of traffic conditions. To obtain large amounts of realistic driving data, several projects have collected real-world driving data. Statistical machine-learning techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning, have been successfully applied to model driver behavior using large amounts of driving data. We have also collected on-road data recording hundreds of drivers over more than 15 years. We have applied statistical signal processing and machine-learning techniques to this data to model various aspects of driver behavior, e.g., driver pedal-operation, car-following, and lane-change behaviors for predicting driver behavior and detecting risky driver behavior and driver frustration. By reviewing related studies and providing concrete examples of our own research, this article is intended to illustrate the usefulness of such data-centric approaches for statistical driver-behavior modeling. © 2016 IEEE.",2016,,IEEE Signal Processing Magazine,33,6,14-21,,10.1109/MSP.2016.2602377,,#6184,Miyajima 2016,,,0

A machine learning based technique for detecting digital image resampling,"Nguyen, H.C.","Digital images can easily be tampered because of the popularity and power editing software. In order to create a persuasive forged image, the image is usually exposed to several geometric transformations, such as rescaling and rotating. Since the manipulations require a resampling step, uncovering traces of resampling became an important approach for detecting image forgeries. In this paper, we propose a new technique to reveal image resampling artifacts. The technique employs specific features of the linear dependencies of neighboring image samples for discriminating resampled images from original images. A machine learning method is utilized for classification. Experimental results in a large dataset show that the proposed technique is good in detecting resampled images, even when the manipulated images were slightly transformed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9622,,75-84,,10.1007/978-3-662-49390-8_7,,#6186,Nguyen 2016,,,0
A Heuristic Strategy for Persuasion Dialogues,"Murphy, J.; Black, E.; Luck, M.","Argument-based persuasion dialogues provide an effective mechanism for agents to communicate their beliefs, and their reasons for those beliefs, in order to convince another agent of some topic argument. In such dialogues, the persuader has strategic considerations, and must decide which of its known arguments should be asserted, and the order in which they should be asserted. Recent works consider mechanisms for determining an optimal strategy for persuading the responder. However, computing such strategies is expensive, swiftly becoming impractical as the number of arguments increases. In response, we present a strategy that uses heuristic information of the domain arguments and can be computed with high numbers of arguments. Our results show that not only is the heuristic strategy fast to compute, it also performs significantly better than a random strategy. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.",2016,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,287,,411-418,,10.3233/978-1-61499-686-6-411,,#6187,Murphy 2016,,,0
"Balancing noise sensitivity, response latency, and posture accuracy for a computer-assisted canine posture training system","Majikes, J.; Brugarolas, R.; Winters, M.; Yuschak, S.; Mealin, S.; Walker, K.; Yang, P.; Sherman, B.; Bozkurt, A.; Roberts, D.L.","This paper describes a canine posture detection system composed of wearable sensors and instrumented devices that detect the postures sit, stand, and eat. The system consists of a customized harness outfitted with wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a base station for processing IMU data to classify canine postures. Research in operant conditioning, the science of behavior change, indicates that successful animal training requires consistent and accurate feedback on behavior. Properly designed computer systems excel at timeliness and accuracy, which are two characteristics most amateur trainers struggle with and professionals strive for. Therefore, in addition to the system being ergonomically designed to ensure the dog׳s comfort and well-being, it is engineered to provide posture detection with timing and accuracy on par with a professional trainer. We contend that providing a system with these characteristics will one day aid dogs in learning from humans by overcoming poor or ineffective timing during training. We present the initial steps in the development and validation of a computer-assisted training system designed to work outside of laboratory environments. The main contributions of this work are (a) to explore the trade-off between low-latency responses to changes in time-series IMU data representative of posture changes while maintaining accuracy and timing similar to a professional trainer, and (b) to provide a model for future ACI technologies by documenting the user-centered approach we followed to create a computer-assisted training system that met the criteria identified in (a). Accordingly, in addition to describing our system, we present the results of three experiments to characterize the performance of the system at capturing sit postures of dogs and providing timely reinforcement. These trade-offs are illustrated through the comparison of two algorithms. The first is Random Forest classification and the second is an algorithm which uses a Variance-based Threshold for classification of postures. Results indicate that with proper parameter tuning, our system can successfully capture and reinforce postures to provide computer-assisted training of dogs. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2017,,International Journal of Human Computer Studies,98,,179-195,,10.1016/j.ijhcs.2016.04.010,,#6188,Majikes 2017,,,0
How should a virtual agent present psychoeducation? Influence of verbal and textual presentation on adherence,"Tielman, M.L.; Neerincx, M.A.; Van Meggelen, M.; Franken, I.; Brinkman, W.-P.","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications, virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness, therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications, it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks, but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation, information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context, this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence. METHODS: This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy, namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample, to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study, we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing, we asked participants (n= 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover, after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection, presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent did. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

A pilot study on personalised coaching to increase older adults’ physical and social activities,"Janols, R.; Guerrero, E.; Lindgren, H.","The aim of this research is to conduct a pilot study of a prototype that provides feedback using theory-based motivating messages developed by older adults, in a context of every day activities that include both physical and social activities. The prototype mobile application integrated the messages, a motivational model, and a personalization module that selects motivational messages based on preferences, motivational profile and the situation. The four participating older adults used the application for planning and following up social and physical activities. They found the messages entertaining and appreciated the dialogues with the application. They used the dialogues primarily to reinforce their satisfaction regarding conducted activities and did not necessarily tell the truth about conduced activities in the interaction with the application.

Computers and people alike investigating the similarity-attraction paradigm in persuasive technology,"Ruijten, P.A.M.; Zhao, T.","A study is presented that tests the relation between the (perceived) personality of an online interactive system and the personality of its user. We expected a system with a dominant interaction style to be more persuasive than a submissive one.

These expectations were tested in a study where participants were provided with automated persuasive messages that had either a dominant or a submissive style. Results support our hypotheses and show that the similarity-attraction paradigm can be extended to persuasive technologies. However, findings also show that the dominant system is perceived as less likable.

It Takes Two to Tango: Modification of Siamese Long Short Term Memory Network with Attention Mechanism in Recognizing Argumentative Relations in Persuasive Essay,"Gema, A.P.; Winton, S.; David, T.; Suhartono, D.; Shodiq, M.; Gazali, W.","We propose a novel approach in a dataset of argumentation relations. This task is intended to analyze the presence of a support relation between two sentences. To be able to identify relations between two sentences or arguments, one is obliged to understand the nuance brought by both sentences. Our models are modification of siamese network architectures, in which we replace the feature extractor into Long Short Term Memory and implement cosine distance as the energy function. Our models take a pair of sentences as their input and try to identify whether there is a support relation between those two sentences or not.The primary motivation of this research is to prove that a high degree of similarity between two sentences correlates to sentences supporting each other. This work will focus more on the modification of siamese network and the implementation of attention mechanism. Due to the difference in dataset setting, we cannot arbitrarily compare our results with the prior research results. Therefore, this work will not highlight the comparison between deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithm per se, but it will be more of an exploratory research.

“Don’t say that!” A survey of persuasive systems in the wild,"Twersky, E.; Davis, J.","Language use is a type of behavior not yet addressed by the academic persuasive technology community. Yet, many existing applications seek to change users’ word choices or writing style. This paper catalogues 32 such applications in common usage or reported in the popular media.

While motivations span the full range of human values, most applications serve values of Achievement, Conformity, or Universalism.

An analysis of individuals’ behavior change in online groups,"Jurgens, D.; McCorriston, J.; Ruths, D.","Many online platforms support social functions that enable their members to communicate, befriend, and join groups with one another. These social engagements are known to shape individuals’ future behavior. However, most work has focused solely on how peers influence behavior and little is known what additional role online groups play in changing behavior. We investigate the capacity for group membership to lead users to change their behavior in three settings: (1) selecting physical activities, (2) responding to help requests, and (3) remaining active on the platform. To do this, we analyze nearly half a million users over five years from a popular fitness-focused social media platform whose unique affordances allow us to precisely control for the effects of social ties, user demographics, and communication. We find that after joining a group, users readily adopt the exercising behavior seen in the group, regardless of whether the group was exercise and non-exercise themed, and this change is not explained by the influence of pre-existing social ties. Further, we find that the group setting equalizes the social status of individuals such that lower status users still receive responses to requests. Finally, we find, surprisingly, that the number of groups one joins is negatively associated with user retention, when controlling for other behavioral and social factors. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10539 LNCS,,473-498,,10.1007/978-3-319-67217-5_29,,#6197,Jurgens 2017,,,0
Alternative reality: An augmented daily urban world inserting virtual scenes temporally,"Ishizawa, F.; Nakajima, T.","In this paper, we propose a new design strategy for integrating fictionality into the real world named Alternative Reality, which makes it possible to connect the daily urban world with the virtual world from a temporal aspect to influence humans to adopt better lifestyles. The worlds also can be seamlessly integrated because the virtual world consists of real landscapes, objects and persons. This means that it may be possible to enhance the real world by showing fictional events among real events: people experience the enhanced hybrid world as in the real world rather than in a fictional world such as a movie. To demonstrate the design strategy of Alternative Reality, we have developed two case studies. The first case study investigates whether a user can sense the improbable behavior of a moving object as realistic, where the user can interact with the object. The second case study investigates whether a user can experience fictional occurrences in the virtual world as they are experienced in the real world. In both case studies, a user wears a head-mounted display to increase the immersion in the hybrid world created by Alternative Reality, in which the virtual world is created by capturing the real world with a 360-degree camera. The insights of the experiments with the case studies show that Alternative Reality effectively augments the real world without losing touch with reality. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10069 LNCS,,353-364,,10.1007/978-3-319-48746-5_36,,#6198,Ishizawa 2016,,,0
Investigation of social predictors of competitive behavior in persuasive technology,"Oyibo, K.; Vassileva, J.","Research has shown that Competition is one of the most powerful persuasive strategies to intrinsically motivate users in a social context towards performing a target behavior. However, in persuasive technology research, studies showing the predictors of the “persuasiveness of Competition” as a motivational strategy are scarce. Consequently, based on a sample size of 213 Canadians, we tested a model using three socially influential strategies (Social Learning, Social Comparison and Reward) as predictors of Competition. Our model accounts for 42% of the variation in Competition and reveals that Reward is the strongest predictor of Competition, followed by Social Comparison, but Social Learning is not a predictor. Moreover, it reveals that Social Comparison mediates the influence of Reward on Social Learning and Competition. Our findings provide designers of persuasive applications with insight into the possibility of implementing Reward, Social Comparison and Competition as effective co-strategies for stimulating user engagement in gamified applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10171 LNCS,,279-291,,10.1007/978-3-319-55134-0_22,,#6199,Oyibo 2017,,,0
Designing intelligent sleep analysis systems for automated contextual exploration on personal sleep-tracking data,"Liang, Z.; Liu, W.; Ploderer, B.; Bailey, J.; Kulik, L.; Li, Y.","There are many sleep tracking technologies in the consumer market nowadays. These technologies offer rich functions ranging from sleep pattern tracking to smart alarm clock.

Mobile health devices as tools for worldwide cardiovascular risk reduction and disease management,"Piette, J.D.; List, J.; Rana, G.K.; Townsend, W.; Striplin, D.; Heisler, M.","We examined evidence on whether mobile health (mHealth) tools, including interactive voice response calls, short message service, or text messaging, and smartphones, can improve lifestyle behaviors and management related to cardiovascular diseases throughout the world. We conducted a state-of-the-art review and literature synthesis of peer-reviewed and gray literature published since 2004. The review prioritized randomized trials and studies focused on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, but included other reports when they represented the best available evidence. The search emphasized reports on the potential benefits of mHealth interventions implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Interactive voice response and short message service interventions can improve cardiovascular preventive care in developed countries by addressing risk factors including weight, smoking, and physical activity. Interactive voice response and short message service-based interventions for cardiovascular disease management also have shown benefits with respect to hypertension management, hospital readmissions, and diabetic glycemic control. Multimodal interventions including Web-based communication with clinicians and mHealth-enabled clinical monitoring with feedback also have shown benefits. The evidence regarding the potential benefits of interventions using smartphones and social media is still developing. Studies of mHealth interventions have been conducted in >30 low- and middle-income countries, and evidence to date suggests that programs are feasible and may improve medication adherence and disease outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that mHealth interventions may improve cardiovascular-related lifestyle behaviors and disease management.

Strategic sequences of arguments for persuasion using decision trees,"Hadoux, E.; Hunter, A.","Persuasion is an activity that involves one party (the persuader) trying to induce another party (the persuadee) to believe or do something. For this, it can be advantageous for the persuader to have a model of the persuadee. Recently, some proposals in the field of computational models of argument have been made for probabilistic models of what the persuadee knows about, or believes. However, these developments have not systematically harnessed established notions in decision theory for maximizing the outcome of a dialogue. To address this, we present a general framework for representing persuasion dialogues as a decision tree, and for using decision rules for selecting moves. Furthermore, we provide some empirical results showing how some well-known decision rules perform, and make observations about their general behaviour in the context of dialogues where there is uncertainty about the accuracy of the user model.

The cognitive role of analogical abduction in skill acquisition,"Furukawa, K.; Kinjo, K.; Ozaki, T.; Haraguchi, M.","In this paper, we discuss the cognitive role of analogical abduction in skill acquisition. Abductive inference makes it possible to find missing links that explain a given knack in achieving a skillful task. We introduced meta level abduction to realize rule abduction which is mandatory in finding intermediate missing links to be added in knack explanation. Analogical abduction can be achieved by adding analogical inference rules to causality rules within meta level abduction. We have applied our analogical abduction method to the problem of explaining the difficult cello playing techniques of spiccato and rapid cross strings of the bow movement. Our method has constructed persuasive analogical explanations about how to play them. We have used a model of forced vibration mechanics as the analogy base world for spiccato, and the specification of the skeletal structure of the hand as the basis for the cross string bowing technique. We also have applied analogical abduction to show the effectiveness of a metaphorical expression of “eating pancake on the sly” to achieve forte-piano dynamics, and successfully identified an analogical explanation of how it works. Through these examples, we show the effectiveness of analogical abduction in skill acquisition. Furthermore we discuss the importance of meta level representation as a basis for providing rich human cognitive paradigm such as causality, analogy and metaphor. Finally we propose a cognitive architecture which gives a possible structure for realizing accommodation on our analogical abduction schema. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10091 LNCS,,499-513,,10.1007/978-3-319-50953-2_37,,#6204,Furukawa 2017,,,0
Identification of a standard AI based technique for credit risk analysis,"Punniyamoorthy, M.; Sridevi, P.","Purpose – Credit risk assessment has gained importance in recent years due to global financial crisis and credit crunch. Financial institutions therefore seek the support of credit rating agencies to predict the ability of creditors to meet financial persuasions. The purpose of this paper is to construct neural network (NN) and fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) classifiers to discriminate good creditors from bad ones and identify a best classifier for credit risk assessment. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses artificial neural network, the most popular AI technique used in the field of financial applications for classification and prediction and the new machine learning classification algorithm, FSVM to differentiate good creditors from bad. As membership value on data points influence the classification problem, this paper presents the new FSVM model. The instances membership is computed using fuzzy c-means by evolving a new membership. The FSVM model is also tested on different kernels and compared and the classifier with highest classification accuracy for a kernel is identified. Findings – The paper identifies a standard AI model by comparing the performances of the NN model and FSVM model for a credit risk data set. This work proves that that FSVM model performs better than back propagation-neural network. Practical implications – The proposed model can be used by financial institutions to accurately assess the credit risk pattern of customers and make better decisions. Originality/value – This paper has developed a new membership for data points and has proposed a new FCM-based FSVM model for more accurate predictions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",2016,,Benchmarking,23,5,1381-1390,,10.1108/BIJ-09-2014-0094,,#6205,Punniyamoorthy 2016,,,0
Computationally viable handling of beliefs in arguments for persuasion,"Hadoux, E.; Hunter, A.","Computational models of argument are being developed to capture aspects of how persuasion is undertaken. Recent proposals suggest that in a persuasion dialogue between some agents, it is valuable for each agent to model how arguments are believed by the other agents. Beliefs in arguments can be captured by a joint belief distribution over the arguments and updated as the dialogue progresses. This information can be used by the agent to make more intelligent choices of move in the dialogue. Whilst these proposals indicate the value of modelling the beliefs of other agents, there is a question of the computational viability of using a belief distribution over all the arguments. We address this problem in this paper by presenting how probabilistic independence can be leveraged to split this joint distribution into an equivalent set of distributions of smaller size. Experiments show that updating the belief on the split distribution is more efficient than performing updates on the joint distribution. © 2016 IEEE.",2017,,"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE 28th International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI 2016",,,319-326,,10.1109/ICTAI.2016.53,,#6206,Hadoux 2017,,,0
"Exploring the links between persuasion, personality and mobility types in personalized mobility applications","Anagnostopoulou, E.; Magoutas, B.; Bothos, E.; Schrammel, J.; Orji, R.; Mentzas, G.","Recent approaches on tackling the problem of sustainable transportation involve persuasive systems and applications. These systems focus on changing citizens’ behavior towards adopting transportation habits that rely more on the use of public transportation, bicycles and walking and less on private cars. A main drawback of existing applications is the limited use or lack of personalization aspects that consider differences in users’ susceptibility to persuasive strategies. In this paper, we explore two user traits that can be used for personalizing the persuasive strategies applied to end users: personality and mobility type. More specifically, we present the results of a study where we examined the perceived persuadability of eight persuasive strategies on users of five personality types and three mobility types. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10171 LNCS,,107-118,,10.1007/978-3-319-55134-0_9,,#6207,Anagnostopoulou 2017,,,0
Why is stack overflow failing? Preserving sustainability in community question answering,"Srba, I.; Bielikova, M.","Enormous amounts of knowledge sharing occur every day in community question answering (CQA) sites, some of which (for example, Stack Overflow or Ask Ubuntu) have become popular with software developers and users. In spite of these systems' overall success, problems are emerging in some of them - increased failure and churn rates. To investigate this trend, researchers conducted a case study of Stack Overflow. First, they evaluated the community perception that the emerging problems are heavily related to the growing amount of low-quality content created by undesired groups of users (help vampires, noobs, and reputation collectors). Reproducible data analyses of content and community evolution supported these findings. Suggestions to deal with the emerging problems include providing users with responder-oriented adaptive support that involves a whole community in QA. Such approaches represent an eminent attitude change regarding QA support, with the aim to preserve CQA ecosystems' long-term sustainability. © 1984-2012 IEEE.",2016,,IEEE Software,33,4,80-89,,10.1109/MS.2016.34,,#6208,Srba 2016,,,0
Construction and Strength Calculation of Threats,"Morveli-Espinoza, M.; Possebom, A.T.; Tacla, C.A.","Threats make part of the set of rhetorical arguments, which are used in negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to persuade his opponent to accept a proposal more readily. When more than one threat is generated, the proponent must evaluate each and select the most adequate. One way of evaluation is calculating the strength of threats, since a strong threat may quickly convince an opponent. The contribution of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we present a mechanism of generation of threats and, on the other hand, we propose a model for calculating the strength of threats, which is based on the goal processing inside the mental state of the opponent. We propose two ways for calculating the strength of threats depending on the kind of negotiation the agent is participating. The first proposal is to be used when the agent negotiates only with one opponent, and the second when the agent negotiates with more than one opponent. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.",2016,,Frontiers in Artificial Intelligence and Applications,287,,403-410,,10.3233/978-1-61499-686-6-403,,#6209,Morveli-Espinoza 2016,,,0
Persuasion dialogues via restricted interfaces using probabilistic argumentation,"Hunter, A.","For persuasion dialogues between a software system and user, a user should be able to present arguments. Unfortunately, this would involve natural language processing which is not viable for this task in the short-term. A compromise is to allow the system to present potential counterarguments to the user, and the user expresses his/her degree of belief in each of them. In this paper, we present a protocol for persuasion that supports this type of move, and show how the system can use the epistemic approach to probabilistic argumentation to model the user, and thereby optimize the choice of moves. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9858 LNAI,,184-198,,10.1007/978-3-319-45856-4_13,,#6210,Hunter 2016,,,0
More than sex: The role of femininity and masculinity in the design of personalized persuasive games,"Busch, M.; Mattheiss, E.; Reisinger, M.; Orji, R.; Fröhlich, P.; Tscheligi, M.","The goal of persuasive games is to change behavior and attitudes in a desirable manner, e.g., to promote physical activity. Research has shown that personalized persuasive approaches are more successful than one-size-fits-all approaches. As a means for personalization, sex has been investigated with results showing that women are overall more persuadable than men. We argue that considering only a dichotomous sex-type categorization may not be able to fully capture the differences in the persuasiveness of persuasion strategies. To that end we apply a dimensional approach of capturing gender identity – femininity and masculinity. We investigate the relationship between masculinity, femininity, sex and the persuasiveness of ten persuasion strategies in an online study (n = 592). Results show that femininity is significantly associated with seven of the ten strategies, while sex does only show differences for two strategies, suggesting gender identity could be a reliable variable for personalizing persuasive games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.",2016,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9638,,219-229,,10.1007/978-3-319-31510-2_19,,#6212,Busch 2016,,,0
Energy data analytics for improved residential service quality and energy efficiency,"Hopf, K.; Sodenkamp, M.; Kozlovskiy, I.","Utility companies generally have an extensive customer base, yet their knowledge about individual households is small. This adversely affects both the development of innovative, household specific services and the utilities' key performance indicators such as customer loyalty and profitability. With the goal to overcome this knowledge deficit, persuasive systems in the form of customer self-service applications and efficiency coaching portals are becoming the getaway of data exchange between utility and user. While improved customer interaction and the collection of customer data within respective information systems is an important step towards a service-oriented company, the immediate value generated from the collected data is still limited, mostly due to the small fraction of customers actually using such systems. We show how to utilize the knowledge gained from the sparse number of active web users in order to provide low-cost and large-scale insights to potentially all residential utility customers. We do so using machine-learning-based Green IT artifacts that allow for improving decision-making, effectiveness of energy audits, and conservation campaigns, thus ultimately increasing the customer value and adoption of related services.

Detecting Health and Behavior Change by Analyzing Smart Home Sensor Data,"Sprint, G.; Cook, D.; Fritz, R.; Schmitter-Edgecombe, M.","Smart home environments offer an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor human behavior. Sensor data collected from smart homes can be labeled using activity recognition to help determine whether relationships exist between behavior in the home and health changes. To detect and analyze behavior changes that accompany health events, we introduce the behavior change detection (BCD) approach. BCD detects activity timing and duration changes between windows of time, determines the significance of the detected changes, and analyzes the nature of the changes. We demonstrate our approach using two case studies for older adults living in smart homes who experienced major health events, including cancer treatment and insomnia. Our algorithm detects behavior changes consistent with the medical literature for these cases. The results suggest the changes can be automatically detected using BCD. The proposed smart home, activity recognition algorithms, and change detection approach are useful data mining techniques for understanding the behavioral effects of major health conditions. © 2016 IEEE.",2016,,"2016 IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing, SMARTCOMP 2016",,,,,10.1109/SMARTCOMP.2016.7501687,,#6214,Sprint 2016,,,0
Adversaries wising up: Modeling heterogeneity and dynamics of behavior,"Abbasi, Y.D.; Ben-Asher, N.; Gonzalez, C.; Morrison, D.; Sintov, N.; Tambe, M.","Security is an important concern worldwide. Stackelberg Security Games have been used successfully in a variety of security applications, to optimally schedule limited defense resources by modeling the interaction between attackers and defenders. Prior research has suggested that it is possible to classify adversary behavior into distinct groups of adversaries based on the ways humans explore their decision alternatives. However, despite the widespread use of Stackelberg Security Games, there has been little research on how adversaries adapt to defense strategies over time (i.e., dynamics of behavior). In this paper, we advance this work by showing how adversaries' behavior changes as they learn the defenders' behavior over time. Furthermore, we show how behavioral game theory models can be modified to capture learning dynamics using a Bayesian Updating modeling approach. These models perform similarly to a cognitive model known as Instance-Based-Learning to predict learning patterns.

An improved artificial fish swarm algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm with extended memory,"Duan, Q.; Mao, M.; Duan, P.; Hu, B.","Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem that the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has a low success rate when applied to the optimization of multi-dimensional and multi-extreme value functions, the authors would introduce the extended memory factor to the PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the paper aims to improve the convergence rate and precision of basic artificial fish swarm algorithm (FSA), a novel FSA optimized by PSO algorithm with extended memory (PSOEM-FSA) is proposed. Design/methodology/approach – In PSOEM-FSA, the extended memory for PSO is introduced to store each particle’ historical information comprising of recent places, personal best positions and global best positions, and a parameter called extended memory effective factor is employed to describe the importance of extended memory. Then, stability region of its deterministic version in a dynamic environment is analyzed by means of the classic discrete control theory. Furthermore, the extended memory factor is applied to five kinds of behavior pattern for FSA, including swarming, following, remembering, communicating and searching. Findings – The paper proposes a new intelligent algorithm. On the one hand, this algorithm makes the fish swimming have the characteristics of the speed of inertia; on the other hand, it expands behavior patterns for the fish to choose in the search process and achieves higher accuracy and convergence rate than PSO-FSA, owning to extended memory beneficial to direction and purpose during search. Simulation results verify that these improvements can reduce the blindness of fish search process, improve optimization performance of the algorithm. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack persuasion. In the future study, the authors will conduct more experiments to understand the behavior of PSOEM-FSA. In addition, there are mainly two aspects that the performance of this algorithm could be further improved. Practical implications – The proposed algorithm can be used to many practical engineering problems such as tracking problems. Social implications – The authors hope that the PSOEM-FSA can increase a branch of FSA algorithm, and enrich the content of the intelligent algorithms to some extent.

Formalizing value-guided argumentation for ethical systems design,"Verheij, B.","The persuasiveness of an argument depends on the values promoted and demoted by the position defended. This idea, inspired by Perelman’s work on argumentation, has become a prominent theme in artificial intelligence research on argumentation since the work by Hafner and Berman on teleological reasoning in the law, and was further developed by Bench-Capon in his value-based argumentation frameworks. One theme in the study of value-guided argumentation is the comparison of values. Formal models involving value comparison typically use either qualitative or quantitative primitives. In this paper, techniques connecting qualitative and quantitative primitives recently developed for evidential argumentation are applied to value-guided argumentation. By developing the theoretical understanding of intelligent systems guided by embedded values, the paper is a step towards ethical systems design, much needed in these days of ever more pervasive AI techniques. © 2016, The Author(s).",2016,,Artificial Intelligence and Law,24,4,387-407,,10.1007/s10506-016-9189-y,,#6217,Verheij 2016,,,0
Ethical dilemmas for adaptive persuasion systems,"Stock, O.; Guerini, M.; Pianesi, F.","A key acceptability criterion for artificial agents will be the possible moral implications of their actions. In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to influence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because of their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are rare and tend to focus on the output of the required action; instead, this work focuses on the acceptability of persuasive acts themselves. Building systems able to persuade while being ethically acceptable requires that they be capable of intervening flexibly and of taking decisions about which specific persuasive strategy to use. We show how, exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment of moral dilemmas, we obtain results that will lead to more ethically appropriate systems. Experiments we have conducted address the type of persuader, the strategies adopted and the circumstances. Dimensions surfaced that can characterize the interpersonal differences concerning moral acceptability of machine performed persuasion, usable for strategy adaptation. We also show that the prevailing preconceived negative attitude toward persuasion by a machine is not predictive of actual moral acceptability judgement when subjects are confronted with specific cases. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Prediction of who will be the next speaker and when using gaze behavior in multiparty meetings,"Ishii, R.; Otsuka, K.; Kumano, S.; Yamato, J.","In multiparty meetings, participants need to predict the end of the speaker's utterance and who will start speaking next, as well as consider a strategy for good timing to speak next. Gaze behavior plays an important role in smooth turn-changing. This article proposes a prediction model that features three processing steps to predict (I) whether turn-changing or turn-keeping will occur, (II) who will be the next speaker in turnchanging, and (III) the timing of the start of the next speaker's utterance. For the feature values of the model, we focused on gaze transition patterns and the timing structure of eye contact between a speaker and a listener near the end of the speaker's utterance. Gaze transition patterns provide information about the order in which gaze behavior changes. The timing structure of eye contact is defined as who looks at whom and who looks away first, the speaker or listener, when eye contact between the speaker and a listener occurs. We collected corpus data of multiparty meetings, using the data to demonstrate relationships between gaze transition patterns and timing structure and situations (I), (II), and (III). The results of our analyses indicate that the gaze transition pattern of the speaker and listener and the timing structure of eye contact have a strong association with turn-changing, the next speaker in turn-changing, and the start time of the next utterance. On the basis of the results, we constructed prediction models using the gaze transition patterns and timing structure. The gaze transition patterns were found to be useful in predicting turn-changing, the next speaker in turn-changing, and the start time of the next utterance. Contrary to expectations, we did not find that the timing structure is useful for predicting the next speaker and the start time. This study opens up new possibilities for predicting the next speaker and the timing of the next utterance using gaze transition patterns in multiparty meetings. © 2016 ACM.",2016,,ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,6,1,,,10.1145/2757284,,#6220,Ishii 2016,,,0
AI-augmented time stretch microscopy,"Mahjoubfar, A.; Chen, C.L.; Lin, J.; Jalali, B.","Cell reagents used in biomedical analysis often change behavior of the cells that they are attached to, inhibiting their native signaling. On the other hand, label-free cell analysis techniques have long been viewed as challenging either due to insufficient accuracy by limited features, or because of low throughput as a sacrifice of improved precision. We present a recently developed artificial-intelligence augmented microscope, which builds upon high-throughput time stretch quantitative phase imaging (TS-QPI) and deep learning to perform label-free cell classification with record high-accuracy. Our system captures quantitative optical phase and intensity images simultaneously by frequency multiplexing, extracts multiple biophysical features of the individual cells from these images fused, and feeds these features into a supervised machine learning model for classification. The enhanced performance of our system compared to other label-free assays is demonstrated by classification of white blood T-cells versus colon cancer cells and lipid accumulating algal strains for biofuel production, which is as much as five-fold reduction in inaccuracy. This system obtains the accuracy required in practical applications such as personalized drug development, while the cells remain intact and the throughput is not sacrificed. Here, we introduce a data acquisition scheme based on quadrature phase demodulation that enables interruptionless storage of TS-QPI cell images.

A review on performance of artificial intelligence and conventional method in mitigating PV grid-tied related power quality events,"Kow, K.W.; Wong, Y.W.; Rajkumar, R.K.","Integration of renewable energy resources into power networks is the trend in power distribution system. It is to reduce burden of centralized power plant and global emissions, increase usage of renewable energy, and diverse energy supply market. However, solar photovoltaic which is a type of renewable energy resource, is found to generate peak capacity for a short duration only. Next, its output is intermittent and randomness. In addition, it changes behavior of power distribution system from unidirectional to bidirectional. As a result, it causes different types of power quality events to the power networks. Therefore, these power quality events are urged to be mitigated to further explore the potential of solar photovoltaic system. This paper aims to investigate negative impacts of photovoltaic (PV) grid-tied system to the power networks, and study on performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and conventional methods in mitigating power quality event. According to the surveys, power system monitoring, inverter, dynamic voltage regulator, static synchronous compensator, unified power quality conditioner and energy storage system are able to compensate power quality events which are caused by PV grid-tied system. From the studies, AI methods usually outperform conventional methods in terms of response time and controllability. They also show talent in multi-mode operation, which is to switch to different operation modes according to the environment. However, they require memory to achieve abovementioned tasks. It is believed that unsupervised learning AI is the future trend as it can adapt to the environment without the need of collecting large amount of data before the AI is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Allrightsreserved.",2016,,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,56,,334-346,,10.1016/j.rser.2015.11.064,,#6222,Kow 2016,,,0
Fuzzy multi-objective modeling of effectiveness and user experience in online advertising,"Jankowski, J.; Kazienko, P.; Wątróbski, J.; Lewandowska, A.; Ziemba, P.; Zioło, M.","The focus placed on maximizing user engagement in online advertising negatively affects the user experience because of advertising clutter and increasing intrusiveness. An intelligent decision support system providing balance between user experience and profits from online advertising based on the fuzzy multi-objective optimization model is presented in this paper. The generalized mathematical model uses uncertain parameters for content descriptors that are difficult to be precisely defined and measured, such as the level of intrusiveness and the change in performance over time. The search for final decision solutions and the verification of the proposed model are based on experimental results from both perceptual studies, which are evaluating visibility and intrusiveness of marketing content as well as online campaigns providing interaction data for estimation of effectiveness. Surprisingly, the online response to the most noticeable advertisements with highly perceived visibility and intrusiveness was relatively low. During the field study performed in order to compute the model parameters, the best results were achieved for advertising content with moderate visual influence on web users. Simulations with the proposed model revealed that a growing level of persuasion can increase results only to a certain extent. Above a saturation point, a strategy based on extensive visual effects, such as high-frequency flashing, resulted in a very high increase of intrusiveness and a slightly better performance in terms of acquired interactions.

People in their workplaces do not receive energy consumption feedback nor do they pay a monthly invoice to electricity providers. In order to enhance workers’ energy awareness, we have transformed everyday shared electrical appliances which are placed in common spaces (e.g. beamer projectors, coffee-makers, printers, screens, portable fans, kettles, and so on) into persuasive eco-aware everyday things. The proposed approach lets these appliances report their usage patterns to a Cloud-server where the data are transformed into time-series and then processed to obtain the appliances’ next-week usage forecast. Autoregressive integrated moving average model has been selected as the potentially most accurate method for processing such usage predictions when compared with the performance exhibited by three different configurations of Artificial neural networks. Our major contribution is the application of soft computing techniques to the field of sustainable persuasive technologies. Thus, consumption predictions are used to trigger timely persuasive interactions to help device users to operate the appliances as efficiently, energy-wise, as possible. Qualitative and quantitative results were gathered in a between-three-groups study related with the use of shared electrical coffee-makers at workplace.

Polarization and bipolar probabilistic argumentation frameworks,"Proietti, C.","Discussion among individuals about a given issue often induces polarization and bipolarization effects, i.e. individuals radicalize their initial opinion towards either the same or opposite directions. Experimental psychologists have put forward Persuasive Arguments Theory (PAT) as a clue for explaining polarization. PAT claims that adding novel and persuasive arguments pro or contra the debated issue is the major cause for polarization. Recent developments in abstract argumentation provide the tools for capturing these intuitions on a formal basis. Here Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (BAF) are employed as a tool for encoding the information of agents in a debate relative to a given issue a. A probabilistic extension of BAF allows to encode the likelihood of the opinions pro or contra a before and after information exchange.

Why are persuasive strategies effective? Exploring the strengths and weaknesssses of socially-oriented persuasive strategies,"Orji, R.","Socially-oriented persuasive strategies (competition, social comparison, and cooperation) which leverage the power of social influence have been widely employed in Persuasive Technologies (PTs) designs. However, there have been mixed findings regarding their effectiveness. There is still a dearth of knowledge on the mechanism through which these strategies could motivate or demotivate behaviors. To advance research in this area, we conduct a large-scale qualitative and quantitative study of 1768 participants to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies and their comparative effectiveness at motivating healthy behaviors. Our results reveal important strengths and weaknesses of individual strategies that could facilitate or hinder their effectiveness such as their tendency to simplify a behavior and make it fun, challenge people and make them accountable and their tendency to jeopardize individual’s privacy and relationships, creates unnecessary tension, and reduce self-confidence, respectively. The results, also show that there are significant differences between the strategies with respect to their persuasiveness overall with the social comparison being the most persuasive of the strategies. We contribute to the PT community by revealing the strengths and weaknesses of individual strategies that should be taken into account by designers when employing each of the strategies. Furthermore, we offer design guidelines for operationalizing the strategies to amplify their strengths and overcome their weaknesses. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",2017,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),10171 LNCS,,253-266,,10.1007/978-3-319-55134-0_20,,#6227,Orji 2017,,,0

A connected health application may involve mobile development, data services, visualisation, machine learning, and sensor signal processing, needing multidisciplinary teams, including professional software engineers. The cost of maintaining a software team across the research and development stages may prove prohibitive for many, hindering innovation. This paper focuses on gathering requirements for data collection in mHealth studies, and reports the initial findings after a round of interviews with researchers in areas such as psychology, physiotherapy, neurology, and health promotion education. Those requirements are framed within an existing End User Development (EUD) tool to create mobile apps for the Android platform, the open source project MIT App Inventor. The survey results highlight not only the development work needed for App Inventor to be used as a data collection tool in DT, but also a number of potential security and privacy issues, and the implementation of a layered feedback loop with a social aspect at the heart of it. © 2016 ACM.",2016,,"Mobile! 2016 - Proceedings of the 1st International Workshop on Mobile Development, co-located with SPLASH 2016",,,23-30,,10.1145/3001854.3001856,,#6228,Veiga 2016,,,0

How persuasive is a virtual coach in terms of promoting web-based intervention user engagement? Exploring a potential match between user support needs and a virtual coach's motivational capabilities,"Scholten, M.; Kelders, S.; Van Gemert-Pijnen, L.","A selection of web-based eHealth interventions have evolved from innovative prototypes to evidence-based and clinically applied solutions for mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. Open-access, self-guided types of those solutions hold the promise of reaching and treating a large population against reasonable costs. However, a considerable factor that currently hinders the effectiveness of these self-guided web-based interventions is the high level of attrition. The absence of a human caregiver apparently has a negative effect on user adherence. Although clear evidence on the rationale for non-adherence is currently missing, recent studies indicate that user support could an important causal factor. In this paper we describe the protocol of an exploratory user study which aims to identify the persuasive features of virtual coaches in terms of user support. Virtual coaches are anthropomorphized instances of software, designed to engage and motivate users. We will measure user experience, engagement, motivation and perceived persuasiveness during usage of the 'Living to the Full' intervention. We will compare a condition with and without empathic virtual coach condition to explore its supportive capabilities. © 2016, CEUR-WS.

Teachable agents with intrinsic motivation,"Borjigin, A.; Miao, C.; Lim, S.F.; Li, S.; Shen, Z.","Dynamic communication between Teachable Agents (TA) and students is crucial for educational effectiveness of the TA, as dynamic interaction is the vital part throughout the teaching and learning processes. Existing TA design mainly focuses on the functions and features to ensure the TA to be taught by students rather than bi-directional interaction. However, according to reciprocity theory in social psychology, if the TA can offer friendly actions, students in response will be much more cooperative and motivated. In order to improve quality of communication and seize the interest of students, we propose a need modeling approach to enable TAs to have “intrinsic motivations”. In this way, the TA can proactively carry out dynamic communication with students so that the TA can adapt to students’ changing behaviors and sustain a good human-agent relationship. Our field study showed that students were highly attracted by the TA with dynamic needs. They statistically completed more tasks. Also, better results were obtained on students’ learning efficiency and attitude towards TA’s informational usefulness and affective interactions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9112,,34-43,,10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9_4,,#6233,Borjigin 2015,,,0
A lane change model based on bayesian networks,"Qiu, X.-P.; Liu, Y.-L.; Ma, L.-N.; Yang, D.","Lane change behavior is one of the most foundational driving behaviors in microscopic traffic flow. Researching the lane change behavior contributes to improving the simulation accuracy of lane change models and reducing traffic accidents caused by improper lane change behavior. The current lane change model is the decision model mostly based on the way of driver's thinking. The shortcoming of current models is difficult to catch certain potential decision-making model and influencing factors in the driver's decisionmaking process. In view of this, this paper introduces a typical artificial intelligence method, Bayesian networks, to establish a new lane change model, and tries to improve the accuracy of the lane change model by machine learning. It uses a segmented discrete method to preprocess vehicle trajectory measurement data, and uses the processed data to training and verification this model. The verification results show that, this model's recognition rate to lane change behavior can reach more than 88%. In addition, this model can be further applied to the development of a driver assistance system. ©, 2015, Science Press.

Designing and analyzing swing compass: A lively interactive system provoking imagination and affect for persuasion,"Chow, K.K.N.; Harrell, D.F.; Yan, W.K.","Grounded in cognitive semantics in cognitive science, the psychology of emotion, and phenomenological approaches to interaction design, this paper first suggests a cognitive and interpretive approach to the imaginative and affective user experiences of “lively” interactive artifacts, which are reminiscent of everyday life experience. It then introduces Swing Compass, an interactive computing system that turns a tablet computer into a compass-like reflective device with artificial intelligence based on an analogy and moderation engine. With configurable analogy and moderation rules and changeable multimedia contents, the device can be instantiated differently, such as “daily activities advisors” or “app-launching guides”, to help people from addiction or decidophobia in various contexts. User experience tests on the device have generated qualitative data showing how it provokes imagination and emotion via conceptual blends and emotional appraisals during different moments. This demonstrates the application of the proposed framework for interpreting users’ meaning-making processes and informing possible orientations of the reflective design in hope of behavior change. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,107-120,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_10,,#6236,Chow 2015,,,0
Automated indexing of Internet stories for health behavior change: Weight loss attitude pilot study,"Manuvinakurike, R.; Velicer, W.F.; Bickmore, T.W.","Background: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. Objective: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss. Methods: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2×2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. Results: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F1,107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F1,97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F1,107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F1,97=0.78, P=.38). Conclusions: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes, such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.",2014,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,16,12,,,10.2196/jmir.3702,,#6237,Manuvinakurike 2014,,,0
Reasons and options for updating an opponent model in persuasion dialogues,"Black, E.; Hunter, A.","Dialogical argumentation allows agents to interact by constructing and evaluating arguments through a dialogue. Numerous proposals have been made for protocols for dialogical argumentation, and recently there is interest in developing better strategies for agents to improve their own outcomes from the interaction by using an opponent model to guide their strategic choices. However, there is a lack of clear formal reasons for why or how such a model might be useful, or how it can be maintained. In this paper, we consider a simple type of persuasion dialogue, investigate options for using and updating an opponent model, and identify conditions under which such use of a model is beneficial. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9524,,21-39,,10.1007/978-3-319-28460-6_2,,#6238,Black 2015,,,0

ClimbTheWorld: Real-time stairstep counting to increase physical activity,"Aiolli, F.; Ciman, M.; Donini, M.; Gaggi, O.","The increasing number of people that are overweight due to a sedentary life requires persuasive strategies to convince people to change their behaviors. In this paper, we present a machine learning based technique to recognize and count stairsteps when a person climbs or descends stairs. This technique has been used as part of ClimbTheWorld, a realtime smartphone application that aims at persuading people to use stairs instead of elevators or escalators, since an engaging activity has more chance to change people's life habits. We perform a fine-grained analysis by exploiting smartphone sensors to recognize single stairsteps. Datadependent sliding windows are used facilitating the learning process and reducing the computational cost. Finally, energy consumption is widely investigated to optimize the trade-off between classification precision and battery usage, to avoid exhausting smartphone battery.

The effects of effort-feedback on time spent for information processing in multi-criteria decision making,"Maier, K.; Frysak, J.; Bernroider, E.W.N.","When making decisions, many people tend to rely on their instinctive choices instead of trusting and adopting those suggested by decision support systems. Feedback interventions can be used to subliminally direct and assist decision makers' attention to increase the accuracy of the decision. This paper seeks to further develop our understanding of such persuasive decision aids for a preferential choice problem. For this purpose, we applied an experiment design with either enabled or disabled feedback interventions in a selfdeveloped computerized decision aid with varying decision complexities. We applied continuous feedback mechanisms using normative rules to evaluate the participants' time investments during their information processing stage. Our findings demonstrate that normative effort feedback impacts both time spent on single items and time spent for overall decision processing. We conclude that effort feedback can be a viable feedback option to implement in decision aids. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",2014,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,275 AISC,VOLUME 1,535-544,,10.1007/978-3-319-05951-8_51,,#6241,Maier 2014,,,0

Creating groups with similar expected behavioural response in randomized controlled trials: A fuzzy cognitive map approach,"Giabbanelli, P.J.; Crutzen, R.","Background: Controlling bias is key to successful randomized controlled trials for behaviour change. Bias can be generated at multiple points during a study, for example, when participants are allocated to different groups. Several methods of allocations exist to randomly distribute participants over the groups such that their prognostic factors (e.g., socio-demographic variables) are similar, in an effort to keep participants' outcomes comparable at baseline. Since it is challenging to create such groups when all prognostic factors are taken together, these factors are often balanced in isolation or only the ones deemed most relevant are balanced. However, the complex interactions among prognostic factors may lead to a poor estimate of behaviour, causing unbalanced groups at baseline, which may introduce accidental bias. Methods: We present a novel computational approach for allocating participants to different groups. Our approach automatically uses participants' experiences to model (the interactions among) their prognostic factors and infer how their behaviour is expected to change under a given intervention. Participants are then allocated based on their inferred behaviour rather than on selected prognostic factors. Results: In order to assess the potential of our approach, we collected two datasets regarding the behaviour of participants (n = 430 and n = 187). The potential of the approach on larger sample sizes was examined using synthetic data. All three datasets highlighted that our approach could lead to groups with similar expected behavioural changes. Conclusions: The computational approach proposed here can complement existing statistical approaches when behaviours involve numerous complex relationships, and quantitative data is not readily available to model these relationships. The software implementing our approach and commonly used alternatives is provided at no charge to assist practitioners in the design of their own studies and to compare participants' allocations. © 2014 Giabbanelli and Crutzen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",2014,,BMC Medical Research Methodology,14,1,,,10.1186/1471-2288-14-130,,#6243,Giabbanelli 2014,,,0
Emotions in argumentation: An empirical evaluation,"Benlamine, S.; Chaouachi, M.; Villata, S.; Cabrio, E.; Frasson, C.; Gandon, F.","Argumentation is often seen as a mechanism to support different forms of reasoning such that decision-making and persuasion, but all these approaches assume a purely rational behavior of the involved actors. However, humans are proved to behave differently, mixing rational and emotional attitudes to guide their actions, and it has been claimed that there exists a strong connection between the argumentation process and the emotions felt by people involved in such process. In this paper, we assess this claim by means of an experiment: during several debates people's argumentation in plain English is connected and compared to the emotions automatically detected from the participants. Our results show a correspondence between emotions and argumentation elements, e.g., when in the argumentation two opposite opinions are conflicting this is reflected in a negative way on the debaters' emotions.",2015,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2015-January,,156-163,,,,#6244,Benlamine 2015,,,0
"Action research and residential waste minimisation in Palmerston North, New Zealand","Farrelly, T.; Tucker, C.","This research adds an action research approach to mixed methods to understand the drivers and barriers to residential waste minimisation in Palmerston North, New Zealand. While local, national, and global structural barriers persisted outside the participants' immediate control, action research enhanced waste minimisation practices within the limits of these structural barriers. The reflexive and collaborative principles of action research allowed research participants to identify individualised needs and challenges. Thus, the research proceeded according to the participants' circumstances. Some of the key drivers included a sense of accountability, active learning, social support, convenience, affordability, and access to information and resources. The participants also offered recommendations to the City Council, producers, and policy-makers to enhance residential waste minimisation in Palmerston North. While the value-action gap persists in purely quantitative waste research seeking to understand and change waste behaviour, action research was beneficial as it added a more nuanced understanding of participants' waste behaviours. It also contextualised waste-related practices and attitudes in a specific locale. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,,"Resources, Conservation and Recycling",91,,Nov-26,,10.1016/j.resconrec.2014.07.003,,#6245,Farrelly 2014,,,0
Optimizing Decision Support for Tailored Health Behavior Change Applications,"Kukafka, R.; Jeong, I.C.; Finkelstein, J.","The Tailored Lifestyle Change Decision Aid (TLC DA) system was designed to provide support for a person to make an informed choice about which behavior change to work on when multiple unhealthy behaviors are present.

Modelling dialogues in court using a gradual argumentation model: A case study,"Wei, B.; Huang, J.","This paper presents a formal model of dialogues in court using a gradual argumentation model. The gradual argumentation model provides computations for the strengths of arguments in an argumentation framework and the degrees of justification of arguments in a gradual argumentation se- mantic. In dialogues in court the adjudicator plays a neutral or active role to decide about burdens and standards of proof in the common law system or in the civil law system. The notions of strength and degree of justification are applied to define the corresponding standards of proof which are suggested as the measurements to assess the burden of production in the argumentation phase and the burden of persuasion in the decision phase. With application of the gradual argumentation model, this paper studies a formal model of dialogues in court. Specifically several new moves for the adjudicator are given within an updated communication language, protocol rules are defined for the adjudicator in accordance with the up- dated communication language are defined, a new notion of Record of commitments (RC) for the adjudicator is added in order to record qualified commitments, and the adjudicator's options in the decision phase are discussed.

Argumentation-based normative practical reasoning,"Shams, Z.; De Vos, M.; Oren, N.; Padget, J.; Satoh, K.","Reasoning about what is best for an agent to do in a particular situation is a challenging task. What makes it even more challenging in a dynamic environment is the existence of norms that aim to regulate a self-interested agent’s behaviour.

Applications tailored to the individual are being developed to aid the worker in mining or mining-related work environments in valuing the risks of their work situation and create awareness in the individual about how he or she can decrease risks for primarily physical damages. The purpose is to encourage the worker to act upon the level of risk for injuries, and upon the new insights the worker gain from the applications. The identified opportunities for and obstacles to integrating ambient information in these health applications are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",2014,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,291,,161-169,,10.1007/978-3-319-07596-9_18,,#6255,Lindgren 2014,,,0
Persuasion in the car: Probing potentials,"Wilfinger, D.; Gärtner, M.; Meschtscherjakov, A.; Tscheligi, M.","The automotive domain has recently investigated interfaces to persuade drivers to drive safer or in a more sustainable way.

Automated Personalized Feedback for Physical Activity and Dietary Behavior Change with Mobile Phones: A Randomized Controlled Trial on Adults,"Rabbi, M.; Pfammatter, A.; Zhang, I.; Spring, B.; Choudhury, T.","Background: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement. Objective: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions. Methods: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions. Results: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001). Conclusions: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed. © 2015 JMIR Publications.

Effect of robot's title in human-robot interaction,"Jung, Y.; Park, T.; Hong, A.","The collaboration between humans and intelligent agents keeps increasing as the technology advances. In this sense, each can rely on the other's strengths to achieve the best overall performance. But as intelligent agents play an increasingly escalating role as a partner rather than mere tools, it is imperative that we understand how humans are influenced by such agents. This is so as to achieve a certain level of persuasiveness to ensure human compliance with intelligent agents in times of need, and also prevent over-reliance on such agents, which may make humans susceptible to manipulation. Reviewing the literature from human-computer interaction, persuasion, and decision-making processes, this study examined the effect of labelling source expertise (i.e., title) on the human decision-making process, when there is not an agreement between human and robot partners. Specifically, we conducted an experiment (n = 88) to investigate how perceived expertise of a robot resulted in the attractiveness, intelligence and credibility of the robot, and how these perceptions influence the level of cooperation and compliance in a desert survival game. The results showed that participants evaluated the robot as more credible when labelled as expert, compared to when labelled as novice. The results of a mediation analysis also showed that perceived credibility successfully mediated the effect of title on cooperation and compliance when there was a conflict in the ranking order of items between each participant and the robot. Implications for future development of artificial intelligence and future research directions are discussed. © 2014 IEEE.",2014,,"2014 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence, URAI 2014",,,28-32,,10.1109/URAI.2014.7057515,,#6259,Jung 2014,,,0
Opportunities for argument-centric persuasion in behaviour change,"Hunter, A.","The aim of behaviour change is to help people overcome specific behavioural problems in their everyday life (e.g. helping people to decrease their calorie intake). In current persuasion technology for behaviour change, the emphasis is on helping people to explore their issues (e.g. through questionnaires or game playing) or to remember to follow a behaviour change plan (e.g. diaries and email reminders). So explicit argumentation with consideration of arguments and counterarguments are not supported with existing persuasion technologies. With recent developments in computational models of argument, there is the opportunity for argument-centric persuasion in behaviour change. In this paper, key requirements for this will be presented, together with some discussion of how computational models of argumentation can be harnessed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",2014,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8761,,48-61,,10.1007/978-3-319-11558-0_4,,#6260,Hunter 2014,,,0

Ethical challenges in emerging applications of persuasive technology,"Timmer, J.; Kool, L.; van Est, R.","Persuasive technologies are gaining ground. As they enter into society they are being applied in more situations, and integrated with other technologies in increasingly smart environments. We argue that this development creates new challenges in designing ethically responsible persuasive technologies. Applications in social contexts like work environments raise the questions whether persuasion serves the interests of the user or the employer, and whether users can still voluntarily choose to use the technology. Informing the user and obtaining consent become complicated when persuasive systems are integrated in smart environments. To ensure that the autonomy of the user is respected, we argue that the user and provider should agree on the goal of persuasion, and users should be informed about persuasion in smart environments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,196-201,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_18,,#6263,Timmer 2015,,,0
Formalizing customization in persuasive technologies,"Kaptein, M.C.","Many authors have noted that customization increases the effectiveness of persuasive technologies. Also, many empirical demonstrations of successful customization efforts exist in the persuasive technology literature. However, a clear formal framework to describe and evaluate customization is lacking. This leads to the worrisome conclusion that statements like: “customization is beneficial” are often ill-defined given the empirical demonstration at hand. In this paper we forward a formalization of customization to prevent such problems. We derive a number of assumptions regarding the data-generating model that need to be met for customization to be fruitful, and we provide several examples of customization criteria. This paper serves as a discussion piece for the persuasive technology conference to evaluate the use and value of (mathematical) formalizations of customization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,27-38,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_3,,#6264,Kaptein 2015,,,0
Detecting aggressive driving behavior with participatory sensing,"Ylizaliturri-Salcedo, M.A.; Tentori, M.; Antonio Garcia-Macias, J.","Aggressive driving increases the risk of accidents, and it is normally a consequence of the impatience, frustration, or anger of drivers. In this paper, we present a case study showing the feasibility of using participatory sensing to enable drivers to report and gain awareness on aggressive driving behavior. We describe the design and development of the Driving Habits System prototype, a mobile application that enables drivers deploying sensing campaigns to collect data about their driving habits. We also discuss the results from a 5-weeks deployment study, where 23 drivers used the system in their everyday lives in the city of Ensenada, Mexico. Our results indicate that our prototype was useful and easy to learn. Its design allows drivers to raise awareness on their driving behaviors and motivates them to engage on a participatory sensing campaign to identify issues on the factors that affect driving.

Automated mobile systems for multidimensional well-being sensing and feedback,"Rabbi, M.","In recent years, we have seen a prolific rise of mobile and wearable sensing in healthcare and fitness. Although the data generated is incredibly useful, state-of-the-art feedback technologies are often limited to either providing an overall status or serving large volume of multi-dimensional sensor data with little processing. My research falls into filling this gap. I work on developing systems that use sensors to understand different dimensions of well being, and subsequently devise interventions through personalized and actionable suggestions. Using simple machine learning techniques, my systems automatically mine user behaviors that influence specific well-being dimensions. Then utilizing decision theory and behavioral psychology theory, my systems create personalized actionable suggestions that are related to existing user's behaviors. In this proposal, I describe how I realize such automated systems for sensing and providing feedback.

Influencing individually: Fusing personalization and persuasion,"Berkovsky, S.; Freyne, J.; Oinas-Kukkonen, H.","Personalized technologies aim to enhance user experience by taking into account users' interests, preferences, and other relevant information. Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computerhuman dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two are combined to create personalized and persuasive systems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the user being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased successes, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques.",2015,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2015-January,,4153-4157,,,,#6270,Berkovsky 2015,,,0
Evaluation of three state-of-the-art classifiers for recognition of activities of daily living from smart home ambient data,"Nef, T.; Urwyler, P.; Büchler, M.; Tarnanas, I.; Stucki, R.; Cazzoli, D.; Müri, R.; Mosimann, U.","Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. The “health state” of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",2015,,Sensors (Switzerland),15,5,11725-11740,,10.3390/s150511725,,#6271,Nef 2015,,,0

Will there be a neurolaw revolution?,"Kolber, A.J.","The central debate in the field of neurolaw has focused on two claims. Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen argue that we do not have free will and that advances in neuroscience will eventually lead us to stop blaming people for their actions. Stephen Morse, by contrast, argues that we have free will and that the kind of advances Greene and Cohen envision will not and should not affect the law. I argue that neither side has persuasively made the case for or against a revolution in the way the law treats responsibility. There will, however, be a neurolaw revolution of a different sort. It will not necessarily arise from radical changes in our beliefs about criminal responsibility but from a wave of new brain technologies that will change society and the law in many ways, three of which I describe here: First, as new methods of brain imaging improve our ability to measure distress, the law will ease limitations on recoveries for emotional injuries. Second, as neuroimaging gives us better methods of inferring people's thoughts, we will have more laws to protect thought privacy but less actual thought privacy. Finally, improvements in artificial intelligence will systematically change how law is written and interpreted. Copyright © 2014 Adam J.

Lessons on using computationally generated influence for shaping narrative experiences,"Roberts, D.L.; Isbell Jr., C.L.","In this paper, we present computational models for generating influence that allow story managers to shape players' decisions in interactive narrative experiences. Our approach uses concepts from social psychology, discourse analysis, and natural language generation. We describe an abstract formalism to operationalize tools of social psychological influence described by Cialdini (Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, New York, NY, USA: Harper-Collins, 1998) and evaluate two example implementations that enable a storytelling system to generate influence on the fly (with varying degrees of success), thereby adapting stories to realize goals specified by authors. These implementations are used in an interactive story where influence is generated dynamically as players' experiences unfold. We present the results of a user study to characterize the effectiveness of these models. Results did not indicate the presence of any significant differences in players' sense of control over the story with, or without, the use of influence. Further, the use of influence resulted in a set of stories experienced by players that more closely matched the author's goals. © 2013 IEEE.",2014,,IEEE Transactions on Computational Intelligence and AI in Games,6,2,188-202,,10.1109/TCIAIG.2013.2287154,,#6278,Roberts 2014,,,0

Answer sentence generation using relationships between terms for guiding users to new topics in dialog systems,"Yuki, Y.; Neubig, G.; Sakti, S.; Tomoki, T.; Satoshi, N.","Answer sentence generation is one of the important building blocks to achieve natural and smooth dialog in dialog systems. In conventional answer sentence generation, the system usually responds according to the user's topic or the information required by the user. However, having a dialog using only this information is not necessarily ideal. For example, in a persuasive dialog system that guides the user to the systems goal, only having a dialog according to the user's topic of interest may not achieve the systems goal. In this situation, it is important to be able to generate answers that guide users to topics related to the system goal. To achieve natural transitions from the current topic to the target topic, it is necessary to lead the conversation through related new topics that connect the current topic and the target topics. In this paper, we propose answer sentence generation methods for guiding users to new topics with answer templates. To effectively extract term pairs that apply to the handmade template from a term database, we take advantage of information from a concept dictionary and Web search. In addition, on the assumption that the user does not know the target topic, we prepare an explanation of each topic by hand. We build a dialog system that guides to the goal topic of the system from the input topic, as a method to evaluate if a dialog system using the proposed method can guide to the goal topic. We evaluate single answer sentences and the usage of the proposed method in a dialog system. The experimental results show the efficacy of the generated sentences.",2014,,Transactions of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence,29,1,80-89,,10.1527/tjsai.29.80,,#6280,Yuki 2014,,,0

In this paper, we focus on the analysis of items influence received from neighborhood and the corresponding iterative preference prediction based on the influence. Specifically speaking, the proposed approach uses influence coefficient to measure an item's ability to influence neighbors' acceptance by users, and predicts a user's preference for an item based on the user's ratings on these items which have influence on the target item. In the meanwhile, the proposed approach distinguishes influence into persuasive influence and supportive influence, and takes into account the combined effect of the two types of influence. Under this methodology, we verified that the proposed algorithm obviously outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods through 5-fold cross validation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",2014,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,290,,553-560,,10.1007/978-3-319-07593-8_64,,#6281,Chang 2014,,,0
An interactive narrative system for narrative-based games for health,"Yin, L.; Bickmore, T.; Montfort, N.","This paper presents an interactive narrative framework we have designed for games that promote health behavior change. The framework aims to address two key issues: player engagement with the game, and player adherence to the health behavior change-related homework they receive in the game. In this paper, we describe our narrative system that tackles these issues and a prototype game that promotes physical activity in which our narrative system is integrated. © Copyright 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Prediction driven behavior: Learning predictions that drive fixed responses,"Modayil, J.; Sutton, R.S.","We introduce a new method for robot control that combines prediction learning with a fixed, crafted response-the robot learns to make a temporally-extended prediction during its normal operation, and the prediction is used to select actions as part of a fixed behavioral response. Our method is inspired by Pavlovian conditioning experiments in which an animal's behavior adapts as it learns to predict an event. Surprisingly the animal's behavior changes even in the absence of any benefit to the animal (i.e. the animal is not modifying its behavior to maximize reward). Our method for robot control combines a fixed response with online prediction learning, thereby producing an adaptive behavior. This method is different from standard non-adaptive control methods and also from adaptive reward-maximizing control methods. We show that this method improves upon the performance of two reactive controls, with visible benefits within 2.5 minutes of real-time learning on the robot. In the first experiment, the robot turns off its motors when it predicts a future over-current condition, which reduces the time spent in unsafe over-current conditions and improves efficiency. In the second experiment, the robot starts to move when it predicts a human-issued request, which reduces the apparent latency of the human-robot interface. © Copyright 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Modelling the persuadee in asymmetric argumentation dialogues for persuasion,"Hunter, A.","Computational models of argument could play a valuable role in persuasion technologies for behaviour change (e.g. persuading a user to eat a more healthy diet, or to drink less, or to take more exercise, or to study more conscientiously, etc). For this, the system (the persuader) could present arguments to convince the user (the persuadee). In this paper, we consider asymmetric dialogues where only the system presents arguments, and the system maintains a model of the user to determine the best choice of arguments to present (including counterarguments to key arguments believed to be held by the user). The focus of the paper is on the user model, including how we update it as the dialogue progresses, and how we use it to make optimal choices for dialogue moves.",2015,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2015-January,,3055-3061,,,,#6284,Hunter 2015,,,0
Using individual and collaborative challenges in behavior change support systems: Findings from a two-month field trial of a trip planner application,"Schrammel, J.; Prost, S.; Mattheiss, E.; Bothos, E.; Tscheligi, M.","Besides other popular strategies, such as feedback and (social) comparisons, challenges have been proposed and used to influence people’s behavior towards a targeted goal. However, only very limited data on the effectiveness of such approaches and how to best design them is available yet. In this work we report the findings of a two months field study analyzing the effectiveness and perception of challenges in the context of influencing personal mobility. Individual and collaborative approaches towards challenges were studied, and specific focus was laid on what aspect makes users willing to participate in these challenges. Our findings suggest that both individual and collaborative challenges have the potential to sustain the interest of users in using behavior change support systems, that collaborative and individual challenges seem to not attract different types of users, that individual challenges in general are preferred, and that challenges are only a useful means for a subset of users. Also, ICT-competence seems to be an important aspect of being willing to participate in electronically organized challenges. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,160-171,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_15,,#6285,Schrammel 2015,,,0
The missing media: The procedural rhetoric of computer games,"Seiffert, J.; Nothhaft, H.","The discussion about the implications of new or digital media focuses mainly on 'social' media. This reduction is a conceptual shortcoming. In order to fully understand how digital media impact on society and the communication landscape, our conceptualisation needs to include new entertainment media, especially computer games. Interactivity here might mean interaction with the AI (artificial intelligence) or human players or both, but the crucial difference lies in the fact that the interaction takes place in a 'world' created by the software. Despite the discussion about 'gamification' in marketing and a tradition of game studies in the humanities, there have been few attempts to treat computer games not only as trivial culture, but as a ""persuasive device"", as a way to shape public opinion. This article explores how the theory of procedural rhetoric, as outlined by Ian Bogost, enhances our understanding of this growing area. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",2015,,Public Relations Review,41,2,254-263,,10.1016/j.pubrev.2014.11.011,,#6286,Seiffert 2015,,,0
Ordinal classification/regression for analyzing the influence of superstars on spectators in cinema marketing,"Montañés, E.; Suárez-Vázquez, A.; Quevedo, J.R.","This paper studies the influence of superstars on spectators in cinema marketing. Casting superstars is a common risk-mitigation strategy in the cinema industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the presence of superstars is not always a guarantee of success and hence, a deeper study is required to analyze the potential audience of a movie. In this sense, knowledge, attitudes and emotions of spectators towards stars are analyzed as potential factors of influencing the intention of seeing a movie with stars in its cast. This analysis is performed through machine learning techniques. In particular, the problem is stated as an ordinal classification/regression task rather than a traditional classification or regression task, since the intention of watching a movie is measured in a graded scale, hence, its values exhibit an order. Several methods are discussed for this purpose, but Support Vector Ordinal Regression shows its superiority over other ordinal classification/regression techniques. Moreover, exhaustive experiments carried out confirm that the formulation of the problem as an ordinal classification/regression is a success, since powerful traditional classifiers and regressors show worse performance. The study also confirms that talent and popularity expressed by means of knowledge, attitude and emotions satisfactorily explain superstar persuasion. Finally, the impact of these three components is also checked. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Generalization analysis for game-theoretic machine learning,"Li, H.; Tian, F.; Chen, W.; Qin, T.; Ma, Z.-M.; Liu, T.-Y.","For Internet applications like sponsored search, cautions need to be taken when using machine learning to optimize their mechanisms (e.g., auction) since self-interested agents in these applications may change their behaviors (and thus the data distribution) in response to the mechanisms. To tackle this problem, a framework called game-theoretic machine learning (GTML) was recently proposed, which first learns a Markov behavior model to characterize agents behaviors, and then learns the optimal mechanism by simulating agents' behavior changes in response to the mechanism. While GTML has demonstrated practical success, its generalization analysis is challenging because the behavior data are non-i.i.d. and dependent on the mechanism. To address this challenge, first, we decompose the generalization error for GTML into the behavior learning error and the mechanism learning error; second, for the behavior learning error, we obtain novel non-asymptotic error bounds for both parametric and non-parametric behavior learning methods; third, for the mechanism learning error, we derive a uniform convergence bound based on a new concept called nested covering number of the mechanism space and the generalization analysis techniques developed for mixing sequences. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaa1.org).

"Gender, age, and responsiveness to cialdini’s persuasion strategies","Orji, R.; Mandryk, R.L.; Vassileva, J.","Research has shown that there are differences in how males and females respond to persuasive attempts. This paper examines the persuasiveness of the six persuasive strategies - Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Commitment and Consistency, Consensus and Liking developed by Cialdini with respect to age and gender. The results of the large-scale study (N = 1108) show that males and females differ significantly in their responsiveness to the strategies. Overall, females are more responsive to most of the strategies than males and some strategies are more suitable for persuading one gender than the other. The results of our study also reveal some differences between younger adults and adults with respect to the persuasiveness of the strategies. Finally, the results show that irrespective of gender and age, there are significant differences between the strategies regarding their perceived persuasiveness overall, shedding light on the comparative effectiveness of the strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,147-159,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_14,,#6289,Orji 2015,,,0
Solving the detour problem in navigation: A model of prefrontal and hippocampal interactions,"Spiers, H.J.; Gilbert, S.J.","Adapting behavior to accommodate changes in the environment is an important function of the nervous system. A universal problem for motile animals is the discovery that a learned route is blocked and a detour is required. Given the substantial neuroscience research on spatial navigation and decision-making it is surprising that so little is known about how the brain solves the detour problem. Here we review the limited number of relevant functional neuroimaging, single unit recording and lesion studies. We find that while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) consistently responds to detours, the hippocampus does not. Recent evidence suggests the hippocampus tracks information about the future path distance to the goal. Based on this evidence we postulate a conceptual model in which: Lateral PFC provides a prediction error signal about the change in the path, frontopolar and superior PFC support the re-formulation of the route plan as a novel subgoal and the hippocampus simulates the new path. More data will be required to validate this model and understand (1) how the system processes the different options; and (2) deals with situations where a new path becomes available (i.e., shortcuts). © 2015 Spiers and Gilbert.",2015,,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,9,MAR,,,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00125,,#6290,Spiers 2015,,,0

Strategic information disclosure to people with multiple alternatives,"Azaria, A.; Rabinovich, Z.; Goldman, C.V.; Kraus, S.","In this article, we study automated agents that are designed to encourage humans to take some actions over others by strategically disclosing key pieces of information. To this end, we utilize the framework of persuasion games-a branch of game theory that deals with asymmetric interactions where one player (Sender) possesses more information about the world, but it is only the other player (Receiver) who can take an action. In particular, we use an extended persuasion model, where the Sender's information is imperfect and the Receiver has more than two alternative actions available. We design a computational algorithm that, from the Sender's standpoint, calculates the optimal information disclosure rule. The algorithm is parameterized by the Receiver's decision model (i.e., what choice he will make based on the information disclosed by the Sender) and can be retuned accordingly. We then provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm's performance in interactions with human Receivers. First, we consider a fully rational (in the Bayesian sense) Receiver decision model and experimentally show the efficacy of the resulting Sender's solution in a routing domain. Despite the discrepancy in the Sender's and the Receiver's utilities from each of the Receiver's choices, our Sender agent successfully persuaded human Receivers to select an option more beneficial for the agent. Dropping the Receiver's rationality assumption, we introduce a machine learning procedure that generates a more realistic human Receiver model. We then show its significant benefit to the Sender solution by repeating our routing experiment. To complete our study, we introduce a second (supply-demand) experimental domain and, by contrasting it with the routing domain, obtain general guidelines for a Sender on how to construct a Receiver model. © 2014 ACM.",2014,,ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology,5,4,,,10.1145/2558397,,#6292,Azaria 2014,,,0

Visualizing mental learning processes with invisible mazes for continuous learning,"Yamaguchi, T.; Takemori, K.; Takadama, K.","This paper presents the way to design the continuous learning process model based on general reinforcement learning framework for both a human and a learning agent. The objective of this research is to bring the learning ability of the learning agent close to that of a human. We focus on both the reinforcement learning framework for the learning agent and the continuous learning model of a human.However, there are two kinds of questions. First question is how to bridge an enormous gap between them. To fill in the missing piece of reinforcement learning whose learning process is mainly behavior change, we add two mental learning processes, awareness as pre-learning process and reflection as post-learning process. Second question is how to observe mental learning processes of a human. Previous methods of human learning researches mostly depend on observable behaviors or activities. On the other hand, a learning process of a human has a major difficulty in observing since it is a mental process. Then a human learning process is yet-to-be-defined. So it is necessary to add a new twist to observe the learning process of a human. To solve this, we propose a new method for visualizing mental learning processes with invisible mazes consisting of invisible walls which are perceived as a sign that is the number of walls in the neighborhood. Besides, we add meta-actions for expressing and summarizing something to be aware of learning from mistake or to be reflected on learning from experience. A learner can mark up his/her sign-action traces by meta-actions for future success. It turns out to visualize his/her mental learning processes. This paper reports our learning support system for a human learner to visualize his/her mental learning processes with invisible mazes for continuous learning. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",2014,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8522 LNCS,PART 2,137-148,,10.1007/978-3-319-07863-2_15,,#6294,Yamaguchi 2014,,,0
Flexible and efficient reuse of multi-mode components for building multi-mode systems,"Yin, H.; Hansson, H.","Software component reuse is deemed as an effective technique for managing the growing software complexity of large systems. Software complexity can also be reduced by partitioning the system behavior into different modes. Such a multi-mode system can change behavior by switching between modes under certain circumstances. Integrating component reuse and the multi-mode approach, we have developed the Mode Switch Logic (MSL), a framework dedicated to the development of multi-mode systems composed by reusable multi-mode components, i.e. components which can run in different modes. The mode switch handling of MSL is based on a fully distributed architecture in the sense that a system mode switch is achieved by the joint mode switches of different independently developed components. In this paper, we propose a mode transformation technique as a supplement to MSL for converting the distributed mode switch handling of MSL to a centralized mode switch handling. The goal is to enhance the run-time mode switch efficiency when components are deployed on a single hardware platform and global mode information is available. We demonstrate this technique by an example and reveal its potential industrial value. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",2014,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8919,,237-252,,10.1007/978-3-319-14130-5_17,,#6295,Yin 2014,,,0
Liability for damages caused by artificial intelligence,"Čerka, P.; Grigiene, J.; Sirbikyte, G.","The emerging discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed attitudes towards the intellect, which was long considered to be a feature exclusively belonging to biological beings, i.e. homo sapiens. In 1956, when the concept of Artificial Intelligence emerged, discussions began about whether the intellect may be more than an inherent feature of a biological being, i.e. whether it can be artificially created. AI can be defined on the basis of the factor of a thinking human being and in terms of a rational behavior: (i) systems that think and act like a human being; (ii) systems that think and act rationally. These factors demonstrate that AI is different from conventional computer algorithms. These are systems that are able to train themselves (store their personal experience). This unique feature enables AI to act differently in the same situations, depending on the actions previously performed. The ability to accumulate experience and learn from it, as well as the ability to act independently and make individual decisions, creates preconditions for damage. Factors leading to the occurrence of damage identified in the article confirm that the operation of AI is based on the pursuit of goals. This means that with its actions AI may cause damage for one reason or another; and thus issues of compensation will have to be addressed in accordance with the existing legal provisions. The main issue is that neither national nor international law recognizes AI as a subject of law, which means that AI cannot be held personally liable for the damage it causes. In view of the foregoing, a question naturally arises: who is responsible for the damage caused by the actions of Artificial Intelligence? In the absence of direct legal regulation of AI, we can apply article 12 of United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, which states that a person (whether a natural person or a legal entity) on whose behalf a computer was programmed should ultimately be responsible for any message generated by the machine. Such an interpretation complies with a general rule that the principal of a tool is responsible for the results obtained by the use of that tool since the tool has no independent volition of its own. So the concept of AI-as-Tool arises in the context of AI liability issues, which means that in some cases vicarious and strict liability is applicable for AI actions. © 2015 Paulius Čerka, Jurgita Grigienė & Gintarė Sirbikytė.",2015,,Computer Law and Security Review,31,3,376-389,,10.1016/j.clsr.2015.03.008,,#6296,Čerka 2015,,,0

Effects of social distance and matching message orientation on consumers' product evaluation,"Yang, L.; Chen, J.; Tan, B.C.Y.","Despite a tremendous increase in the online sales of experiential products (e.g., clothes), how to present such kind of products to better intrigue online consumers remains unsolved. Relative to model presentation (i.e., presented by professional models), peer presentation (i.e., presented by peer consumers) is emerging as a new way of IT-enabled product presentation welcomed by online clothing merchants. Drawing on the Construal Level Theory, we examine the effects of peer presentation vs. model presentation, and the fitness between recommendation messages and these two types of presentation. We propose that compared to model presentation, peer presentation yields a closer psychological distance to a consumer, and is likely to arouse a lower level mental construal of the consumer. Thus, alongside peer presentation, a recommendation message that fits a low level construal (i.e., secondary features) is more persuasive. Contrarily, alongside model presentation, a recommendation message that fits a high level construal (i.e., primary features) is more persuasive. Lab experiments and a field experiment are designed to test these hypotheses. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",2014,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8527 LNCS,,787-797,,10.1007/978-3-319-07293-7_76,,#6299,Yang 2014,,,0

In our previous work, we gave a set of axioms to state the object level causalities in terms of first-order-logic (FOL) clauses, which represent direct and indirect causalities by transitive rules. Here we extend our formalism of the meta level abductive reasoning by adding rules to conduct analogical inference. We apply our analogical abduction method to the problem of explaining the difficult cello playing techniques of spiccato, rapid cross strings of the bow movement and one-bow staccato. Our method constructs persuasive analogical explanations about how to play them. We use a model of forced vibration mechanics as the base world for spiccato, the specification of the skeletal structure of the hand as the basis for the cross string bowing technique and behavioral similarity for one-bow staccato, respectively.

Nevertheless, the adequate application of gamification is a complex task that requires deeper knowledge about game design and their impact on collaborative learning (CL).

Important aspects to implement are transparency, reciprocity, and collaborative use of resources for both computers and humans. The symbiotic relationship is also characterized by goals and agency independence of humans and computers.

Ontology-based named entity recognizer for behavioral health,"Yasavur, U.; Amini, R.; Lisetti, C.; Rishe, N.","Named-Entity Recognizers (NERs) are an important part of information extraction systems in annotation tasks. Although substantial progress has been made in recognizing domain-independent named entities (e.g. location, organization and person), there is a need to recognize named entities for domain-specific applications in order to extract relevant concepts. Due to the growing need for smart health applications in order to address some of the latest worldwide epidemics of behavioral issues (e.g. over eating, lack of exercise, alcohol and drug consumption), we focused on the domain of behavior change, especially lifestyle change. To the best of our knowledge, there is no named-entity recognizer designed for the lifestyle change domain to enable applications to recognize relevant concepts. We describe the design of an ontology for behavioral health based on which we developed a NER augmented with lexical resources. Our NER automatically tags words and phrases in sentences with relevant (lifestyle) domain-specific tags (e.g. [un/]healthy food, potentially-risky/healthy activity, drug, tobacco and alcoholic beverage). We discuss the evaluation that we conducted with with manually collected test data. In addition, we discuss how our ontology enables systems to make further information acquisition for the recognized named entities by using semantic reasoners.

Wicked persuasion: A designerly approach,"Knowles, B.; Coulton, P.; Lochrie, M.; Whittle, J.","Persuasive computing has tended to be applied toward the promotion of minor behavior change in the direction of easily understood and uncontroversial goals. Such approaches may not make sense, however, when designing for so called 'wicked problems'. We argue that while wicked problems can be effectively addressed through persuasive technology, a 'designerly' (as opposed to engineering or experimental psychology) approach is required in their creation. We illustrate this approach through the design of our own persuasive system directed at the wicked problem of encouraging local spending, and we draw lessons for persuasive design more generally. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.",2014,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8462 LNCS,,137-142,,10.1007/978-3-319-07127-5_12,,#6307,Knowles 2014,,,0
Database workload management through CBR and fuzzy based characterization,"Abdul, M.; Muhammad, A.M.; Mustapha, N.; Muhammad, S.; Ahmad, N.","Database Management System (DBMS) is used as a data source with financial, educational, web and other applications from last many years. Users are connected with the DBMS to update existing records and retrieving reports by executing workloads that consist of complex queries. In order to get the sufficient level of performance, arrangement of workloads is necessary. Rapid growth in data, maximum functionality and changing behavior tends the database workload to be more complex and tricky. Each DBMS experiences complex workloads that are difficult to manage by the humans; human experts take much time to manage database workload efficiently; even in some cases it may become impossible and leads toward malnourishment. This problem leads database practitioners, vendors and researchers toward new challenges. To achieve a satisfactory level of performance, either Database Administrator (DBA) or DBMSs must have the knowledge about the workload shifts. Efficient execution and resource allocation of workload is dependent on the workload type that may be either On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support System (DSS). The research introduces a way to manage the workload in DBMSs on the basis of the workload type. The main goal of the research is to manage the workload in DBMSs through characterization, scheduler and idleness detection modules. The database workload management is performed by using the case based reasoning characterization; Fuzzy logic based scheduling and finally detection of CPU Idleness. Results are validated through experiments that are performed on real time and benchmark workload to reveal effectiveness and efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",2014,,Applied Soft Computing Journal,22,,605-621,,10.1016/j.asoc.2014.04.030,,#6308,Abdul 2014,,,0
Is it morally acceptable for a system to lie to persuade me?,"Guerini, M.; Pianesi, F.; Stock, O.","Given the fast rise of increasingly autonomous artificial agents and robots, a key acceptability criterion will be the possible moral implications of their actions. In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to influence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because of their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are rare and tend to focus on the output of the required action. Instead, this work focuses on the persuasive acts themselves (e.g. ""is it morally acceptable that a machine lies or appeals to the emotions of a person to persuade her, even if for a good end?"")- Exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment of moral dilemmas - i.e. without any prior assumption of underlying ethical theories - This paper reports on a set of experiments. These experiments address the type of persuader (human or machine), the strategies adopted (purely argumentative, appeal to positive emotions, appeal to negative emotions, lie) and the circumstances. Findings display no differences due to the agent, mild acceptability for persuasion and reveal that truth-conditional reasoning (i.e. argument validity) is a significant dimension affecting subjects' judgment. Some implications for the design of intelligent persuasive systems are discussed. © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Do computer games enhance learning about conflicts? A cross-national inquiry into proximate and distant scenarios in Global Conflicts,"Kampf, R.; Cuhadar, E.","Abstract Interactive conflict resolution and peace education have developed as two major lines of practice to tackle intractable inter-group conflicts. Recently, new media technologies such as social media, computer games, and online dialogue are added to the existing set of tools used for peace education. However, a debate is emerging as to how effective they are in motivating learning and teaching skills required for peace building. We take issue with this question and have conducted a study investigating the effect of different conflict contexts on student learning. We have designed a cross-national experimental study with Israeli-Jewish, Palestinian, and Guatemalan undergraduate students using the Israeli-Palestinian and Guatemalan scenarios in the computer game called ""Global Conflicts."" The learning effects of these scenarios were systematically analyzed using pre- and post-test questionnaires. The study indicated that Israeli-Jews and Palestinians acquired more knowledge from the Guatemalan game than Guatemalans acquired from the Israeli-Palestinian game. All participants acquired knowledge about proximate conflicts after playing games about these scenarios, and there were insignificant differences between the three national groups. Israeli-Jews and Palestinians playing the Israeli-Palestinian game changed their attitudes about this conflict, while Guatemalans playing the Guatemalan game did not change their attitudes about this case. All participants changed their attitudes about distant conflicts after playing games about these scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",2015,,Computers in Human Behavior,52,,541-549,,10.1016/j.chb.2014.08.008,,#6310,Kampf 2015,,,0
An adaptive computational model for personalized persuasion,"Kang, Y.; Tan, A.-H.; Miao, C.","While a variety of persuasion agents have been created and applied in different domains such as marketing, military training and health industry, there is a lack of a model which can provide a unified framework for different persuasion strategies. Specifically, persuasion is not adaptable to the individuals' personal states in different situations. Grounded in the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this paper presents a computational model called Model for Adaptive Persuasion (MAP) for virtual agents. MAP is a semi-connected network model which enables an agent to adapt its persuasion strategies through feedback. We have implemented and evaluated a MAP-based virtual nurse agent who takes care and recommends healthy lifestyle habits to the elderly. Our experimental results show that the MAP-based agent is able to change the others' attitudes and behaviors intentionally, interpret individual differences between users, and adapt to user's behavior for effective persuasion.",2015,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2015-January,,61-67,,,,#6311,Kang 2015,,,0

Applying reinforcement learning to an insurgency Agent-based Simulation,"Collins, A.; Sokolowski, J.; Banks, C.","A requirement of an Agent-based Simulation (ABS) is that the agents must be able to adapt to their environment. Many ABSs achieve this adaption through simple threshold equations due to the complexity of incorporating more sophisticated approaches. Threshold equations are when an agent behavior changes because a numeric property of the agent goes above or below a certain threshold value. Threshold equations do not guarantee that the agents will learn what is best for them. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence approach that has been extensively applied to multiagent systems but there is very little in the literature on its application to ABS. Reinforcement learning has previously been applied to discrete-event simulations with promising results; thus, reinforcement learning is a good candidate for use within an Agent-based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) environment. This paper uses an established insurgency case study to show some of the consequences of applying reinforcement learning to ABMS, for example, determining whether any actual learning has occurred. The case study was developed using the Repast Simphony software package. © 2013 The Society for Modeling.",2014,,Journal of Defense Modeling and Simulation,11,4,353-364,,10.1177/1548512913501728,,#6314,Collins 2014,,,0
Normative practical reasoning: An argumentation-based approach,"Shams, Z.","Autonomous agents operating in a dynamic environment must be able to reason and make decisions about actions in pursuit of their goals. In addition, in a normative environment an agent's actions are not only directed by the agent's goals, but also by the norms imposed on the agent. Practical reasoning is reasoning about what to do in a given situation, particularly in the presence of conflicts between the agent's practical attitude such as goals, plans and norms. In this thesis we aim: (i) to introduce a model for normative practical reasoning that allows the agents to plan for multiple and potentially conflicting goals and norms at the same time (ii) to implement the model both formally and computationally, (iii) to identify the best plan for the agent to execute by means of argumentation framework and grounded semantics, (iv) to justify the best plan via argumentation-based persuasion dialogue for grounded semantics.",2015,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2015-January,,4397-4398,,,,#6315,Shams 2015,,,0
(Re)defining gamification: A process approach,"Werbach, K.","Gamification is a growing phenomenon of interest to both practitioners and researchers. There remains, however, uncertainty about the contours of the field.

Understanding how message receivers’ communication goals are applied in online persuasion,"Wilson, E.V.","Prior research demonstrated that message receivers’ primary and secondary communication goals are important predictors of their evaluation of online persuasive messages. The present study was undertaken to illuminate the process by which these communication goals are applied in response to received messages. The findings demonstrate that communication goals are applied immediately upon viewing even a simple message directory listing containing subject, sender, and date information. Once activated, communication goals significantly predict intention to comply with a message request, although predictiveness increases substantially when the complete message is read. Further analysis suggests that message receivers’ communication goals can offer rich explanations of the cognitive processes that are used to evaluate online persuasive messages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,39-50,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_4,,#6317,Wilson 2015,,,0
Does the mind extend into the world?,"Gunn, R.","In order to examine ideas on extended mind I will be looking at the writing of its exponents and its critics and using examples of cognitive systems from daily life and from research. I will show that the notion of extended mind, when linked with regularly cited examples, is at best a weak argument; at worst these examples are not part of any kind of cognitive system at all and are simply a way of retrieving and using information. The notion of extended mind depends on external elements (outside skin and skull) being integrated into the cognitive system such that the unconscious cognitive function is affected thus changing this function. I will show that the external components of the integrated system do not need to hold reliable information that fit with beliefs, mimic memory or support changing behaviour, as some writers would have it; instead the key to whether some external object or set of information is part of a cognitive system is dependent on the level of transparent integration within an unconscious part of that system.",2014,,AISB 2014 - 50th Annual Convention of the AISB,,,,,,,#6318,Gunn 2014,,,0
Development of tidy-up promotion system by anthropomorphication of shared space,"Kitamura, T.; Jin, T.; Urayama, M.; Ishii, H.; Shimoda, H.","Although it is important for our daily lives and works to keep things tidy and in order, it is difficult to always keep it especially in the shared space because it is unclear who has the responsibility. In this study, therefore, a method to persuade them to change their daily behaviors has been proposed from the concept of Ambient Intelligence. In order to realize the method, a system has been developed to encourage them to keep things tidy and in order by personifying the shared space. The personified system expresses its emotions in response to the degree of the disorder. The system consists of (1) a disorder estimation function from the captured image of the shared space by a camera, (2) an emotion creation function of the personified space by the transition of the disorder, and (3) an emotion expression function in appropriate timing. In addition, a case study had been conducted for 31 days to evaluate the system in a student room of a laboratory. As the result, the longer they stayed in the room, the more they watched the messages of the personified room, and improved their consciousness and habituation of keeping the room in order. However, the users who rarely stayed in the room did not improve the habituation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9169,,360-369,,10.1007/978-3-319-20901-2_33,,#6319,Kitamura 2015,,,0
Gamifying social media to encourage social activities with digital-physical hybrid role-playing,"Sakamoto, M.; Nakajima, T.","This paper proposes a new way to gamify the micro-crowdfunding service. Micro-crowdfunding is a crowdsourcing service to achieve a sustainable society based on a crowdfunding concept and an aging money concept. In this type of service, each activity to achieve a sustainable society is called a mission, and performing a mission is encouraged through social and economic incentives. A new approach described in this paper enhances the original strategies by using a game concept. The approach consists of two techniques. The first technique adopts several concepts from dramaturgy. The technique coordinates multiple missions and encourages people to complete them by providing a fictional goal that most people want to achieve. The second technique incorporates persuasive ambient mirrors that reflect people's current situation with visual and fictional expressions. The technique emotionally increases people's incentives by using operant conditioning. We also conduct a user study to validate the approach proposed in this paper. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",2014,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8531 LNCS,,581-591,,10.1007/978-3-319-07632-4_55,,#6320,Sakamoto 2014,,,0
Tuning belief revision for coordination with inconsistent teammates,"Sarratt, T.; Jhala, A.","Coordination with an unknown human teammate is a notable challenge for cooperative agents. Behavior of human players in games with cooperating AI agents is often sub-optimal and inconsistent leading to choreographed and limited cooperative scenarios in games. This paper considers the difficulty of cooperating with a teammate whose goal and corresponding behavior change periodically. Previous work uses Bayesian models for updating beliefs about cooperating agents based on observations. We describe belief models for on-line planning, discuss tuning in the presence of noisy observations, and demonstrate empirically its effectiveness in coordinating with inconsistent agents in a simple domain. Further work in this area promises to lead to techniques for more interesting cooperative AI in games. Copyright © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Development of automatic surveillance of animal behaviour and welfare using image analysis and machine learned segmentation technique,"Nilsson, M.; Herlin, A.H.; Ardö, H.; Guzhva, O.; Aström, K.; Bergsten, C.","In this paper the feasibility to extract the proportion of pigs located in different areas of a pig pen by advanced image analysis technique is explored and discussed for possible applications. For example, pigs generally locate themselves in the wet dunging area at high ambient temperatures in order to avoid heat stress, as wetting the body surface is the major path to dissipate the heat by evaporation. Thus, the portion of pigs in the dunging area and resting area, respectively, could be used as an indicator of failure of controlling the climate in the pig environment as pigs are not supposed to rest in the dunging area. The computer vision methodology utilizes a learning based segmentation approach using several features extracted from the image. The learning based approach applied is based on extended state-of-the-art features in combination with a structured prediction framework based on a logistic regression solver using elastic net regularization. In addition, the method is able to produce a probability per pixel rather than form a hard decision. This overcomes some of the limitations found in a setup using grey-scale information only. The pig pen is a difficult imaging environment because of challenging lighting conditions like shadows, poor lighting and poor contrast between pig and background. In order to test practical conditions, a pen containing nine young pigs was filmed from a top view perspective by an Axis M3006 camera with a resolution of 640×480 in three, 10-min sessions under different lighting conditions. The results indicate that a learning based method improves, in comparison with greyscale methods, the possibility to reliable identify proportions of pigs in different areas of the pen. Pigs with a changed behaviour (location) in the pen may indicate changed climate conditions. Changed individual behaviour may also indicate inferior health or acute illness. © The Animal Consortium 2015.",2015,,Animal,9,11,1859-1865,,10.1017/S1751731115001342,,#6322,Nilsson 2015,,,0

Building support-based opponent models in persuasion dialogues,"Hadjinikolis, C.; Modgil, S.; Black, E.","This paper deals with an approach to opponent-modelling in argumentation-based persuasion dialogues. It assumes that dialogue participants (agents) have models of their opponents’ knowledge, which can be augmented based on previous dialogues. Specifically, previous dialogues indicate relationships of support, which refer both to arguments as abstract entities and to their logical constituents. The augmentation of an opponent model relies on these relationships. An argument external to an opponent model can augment that model with its logical constituents, if that argument shares support relationships with other arguments that can be constructed from that model. The likelihood that the constituents of supporting arguments will in fact be known to an opponent, varies according to support types. We therefore provide corresponding quantifications for each support type. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9524,,128-145,,10.1007/978-3-319-28460-6_8,,#6325,Hadjinikolis 2015,,,0

In this study, we performed a laboratory experiment, in an airport screening context, to assess how people's linguistic behavior changes with their perceptions of the ECA's power and likeability.

Involvement as a working mechanism for persuasive technology,"Kelders, S.M.","Internet interventions have been shown to be effective for treatment of mental health complaints. Although non-adherence poses a problem, persuasive technology might be a solution. However, there is limited insight in how and why technology may lead to more adherence and effectiveness. This study explores the role of involvement in a Behavior Change Support System (BCSS) for treatment of depression. Involvement is seen as an important factor in the success of treatment, but has received little research attention. This study expands on an earlier study and uses self-reported data to explore differences between versions of the BCSS on involvement. The results show that involvement and adherence are related, but involvement outperforms adherence as predictor for effectiveness. This underlines the importance of involvement: it may be a working mechanism of persuasive technology and may be used as an early measure to assess whether the intervention is likely to reach its goals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9072,,Mar-14,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_1,,#6328,Kelders 2015,,,0

Semi-supervised stream clustering using labeled data points,"Treechalong, K.; Rakthanmanon, T.; Waiyamai, K.","Semi-supervised stream clustering performs cluster analysis of data streams by exploiting background or domain expert knowledge. Almost of existing semi-supervised stream clustering techniques exploit background knowledge as constraints such as must-link and cannotlink constraints. The use of constraints is not appropriate with respect to the dynamic nature of data streams. In this paper, we proposed a new semi-supervised stream clustering algorithm, SSE-Stream. SSE-Stream exploits background knowledge in the form of single labeled data points to monitor and detect change of the clustering structure evolution. Exploiting background knowledge as single labeled data points is more appropriate for data streams. They can be immediately utilised for determining the class of clusters, and effectively support the changing behavior of data streams. SSE-Stream defines new cluster representation to include labeled data points, and uses it to extend the clustering operations such as merge and split for detecting change of the clustering structure evolution. Experimental results on real-world stream datasets show that SSE-Stream is able to improve the output clustering quality, especially for highly complex and drift datasets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",2015,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),9166,,281-295,,10.1007/978-3-319-21024-7_19,,#6330,Treechalong 2015,,,0

How to change a group's collective decision?,"Hazon, N.; Lin, R.; Kraus, S.","Persuasion is a common social and economic activity. It usually arises when conflicting interests among agents exist, and one of the agents wishes to sway the opinions of others. This paper considers the problem of an automated agent that needs to influence the decision of a group of self-interested agents that must reach an agreement on a joint action. For example, consider an automated agent that aims to reduce the energy consumption of a nonresidential building, by convincing a group of people who share an office to agree on an economy mode of the air-conditioning and low light intensity. In this paper we present four problems that address issues of minimality and safety of the persuasion process. We discuss the relationships to similar problems from social choice, and show that if the agents are using Plurality or Veto as their voting rule all of our problems are in P. We also show that with K-Approval, Bucklin and Borda voting rules some problems become intractable. We thus present heuristics for efficient persuasion with Borda, and evaluate them through simulations.",2013,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,,,198-205,,,,#6334,Hazon 2013,,,0
The scrabble of language towards persuasion: Changing behaviors in journalism,"Dowd, C.","The rise of social media influences in the online journalism domain suggests that new learning systems are required to modify the behaviors of journalists. The design of future systems can be explored as game concepts and guided by an emerging ontology for journalism. For these ends this paper identifies vocabulary, concepts and emotions in the domain, and vital intersections with social media, such as crowdsourcing. Data from participatory workshops with journalists is applied to new synthetic player ideas, using Hoare logic. It is also lightly structured for a starting ontology for journalism, to inform how a synthetic player system might persuade a journalist to check their behaviors. It prompts the core values of journalism, such as obtaining opposing views, and prompts critical engagement with crowdsourcing, before declaring a story newsworthy. The system includes contextual emotions, which may vary from inspiration and curiosity to anxiety, due to not having a story. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2013,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),7822 LNCS,,39-50,,10.1007/978-3-642-37157-8_7,,#6335,Dowd 2013,,,0

Arguments over co-operative plans,"Medellin-Gasque, R.; Atkinson, K.; McBurney, P.; Bench-Capon, T.","Autonomous planning agents that share a common goal should be able to propose, justify and share information about plans. To reach an agreement on the best plan, strategies for persuasion and negotiation could be used by agents in order to share their beliefs about the world and resolve conflicts between the agents. We present an argumentation scheme and associated critical questions to create and justify plan proposals where plans are combinations of actions requiring several agents for their execution. An analysis of different ways in which actions can combine is presented and then associated with the argumentation scheme and the critical questions.

Online behavior change detection in computer games,"Vallim, R.M.M.; Andrade Filho, J.A.; De Mello, R.F.; De Carvalho, A.C.P.L.F.","Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from the game community in the recent years. The ability to build accurate models of player behavior can be useful in many aspects of a game. One important aspect is the tracking of a player's behavior along time, informing every time a change is perceived. This way, the game Artificial Intelligence can adapt itself to better respond to this new behavior. In order to build models of player behavior, researchers frequently resort to Machine Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded game metrics representing player's interactions with the game environment. However, if the player changes styles over time, the constructed models get out of date. In order to address this drawback, this work proposes the use of and incremental learning technique to track a player's behavior during his/her interaction with the game environment. Our approach attempts to automatically detect the moments in time when the player changes behavior. We apply a change detection technique from the area of Data Stream Mining that is based on incremental clustering and novelty detection. We also propose three modifications to the original technique, in order to formalize change detection, improve detection rate and reduce detection delay. Simulations were performed considering data produced by the Unreal Tournament game, showing the applicability of the method to online tracking of a player's behavior and informing whenever behavior changes occur. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Shikakeology and marketing,"Yamamoto, H.","The aim of this paper is to provide a deeper understanding of Shikake through the lens of marketing. ""The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous"" is a famous quote by Peter Drucker. Its key message is that marketing is not an effort to control or force consumers to purchase products or services, but an activity to create a situation where consumers engage in consumer behavior spontaneously. The core essence of Shikakeology is a spontaneous behavior change, and it is fair to assume that marketing and Shikakeology share a fundamental philosophy. This paper defines the key concepts in the intersection of marketing and Shikakeology and attempts to classify Shikakes in the field of marketing in accordance with participants' motivation and consciousness. Different types of consumer participation are described in case studies. Finally, attempts are made to reveal the key to success of a Shikake in the field of marketing and discuss future research opportunities. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.",2013,,AAAI Spring Symposium - Technical Report,SS-13-06,,101-106,,,,#6341,Yamamoto 2013,,,0
The Narrative Dimension,"Nissan, E.","We begin by discussing legal narratives, and overall narrative plausibility. We consider approaches from the New Evidence scholarship, discuss background generalisations, as well as the impact of modes of communication (the pragmatics of the delivery in court of a legal narrative), and then warn about pitfalls to avoid, in consideration of what controversy within legal scholarship implies about the need for the modelling of legal narratives with artificial intelligence techniques to meet with approval from legal scholars. We then undertake a long overview (in over twenty subsections) of artificial intelligence approaches to narratives. Historically, a legal context for narratives was involved in tools such as BORIS and STARE. Among the other things, we consider the JAMA model, and then conclude the overview with a project from quarters different from those traditionally associated with story-processing in the artificial intelligence research community: namely, Löwe, Pacuit and Saraf’s application of mathematical logic to crime stories. We then explain episodic formulae, and develop an example: the controversy concerning a collection of stuffed birds amid allegations that items were stolen and restuffed. We finally consider Bex’s approach to combining stories and arguments in sense-making software for crime investigation, and then Bex and Bench-Capon’s undertaken project concerning persuasion stories vs. arguments. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",2012,,"Law, Governance and Technology Series",5,,323-481,,10.1007/978-90-481-8990-8_5,,#6342,Nissan 2012,,,0

The impact of connection topology and agent size on cooperation in the iterated prisoner's dilemma,"Barlow, L.-A.; Ashlock, D.","This study revisits earlier work, concerning the evolutionary trajectory of agents trained to play iterated prisoner's dilemma on a combinatorial graph. The impact of different connection topologies, used to mediate both the play of prisoner's dilemma and the flow of genes during selection and replacement, is examined. The variety of connection topologies, stored as combinatorial graphs, is revisited and the analysis tools used are substantially improved. A novel tool called the play profile summarizes the distribution of behaviors over multiple replicates of the basic evolutionary algorithm and through multiple evolutionary epochs. The impact of changing the number of states used to encode agents is also examined. Changing the combinatorial graph on which the population resides is found to yield statistically significant differences in the play profiles. Changing the number of states in agents is also found to produce statistically significant differences in behavior. The use of multiple epochs in analysis of agent behavior demonstrates that the distribution of behaviors changes substantially over the course of evolution. The most common pattern is for agents to move toward the cooperative state over time, but this pattern is not universal. Another clear trend is that agents implemented with more states are less cooperative. © 2013 IEEE.",2013,,"IEEE Conference on Computatonal Intelligence and Games, CIG",,,,,10.1109/CIG.2013.6633611,,#6345,Barlow 2013,,,0
Individualized patient-centered lifestyle recommendations: An expert system for communicating patient specific cardiovascular risk information and prioritizing lifestyle options,"Chi, C.-L.; Nick Street, W.; Robinson, J.G.; Crawford, M.A.","We propose a proof-of-concept machine-learning expert system that learned knowledge of lifestyle and the associated 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks from individual-level data (i.e., Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, ARIC). The expert system prioritizes lifestyle options and identifies the one that maximally reduce an individual's 10-year CVD risk by (1) using the knowledge learned from the ARIC data and (2) communicating for patient-specific cardiovascular risk information and personal limitations and preferences (as defined by variables used in this study). As a result, the optimal lifestyle is not only prioritized based on an individual's characteristics but is also relevant to personal circumstances.We also explored probable uses and tested the system in several examples using real-world scenarios and patient preferences. For example, the system identifies the most effective lifestyle activities as the starting point for an individual's behavior change, shows different levels of BMI changes and the associated CVD risk reductions to encourage weight loss, identifies whether weight loss or smoking cessation is the most urgent change for a diabetes patient, etc. Answers to the questions noted above vary based on an individual's characteristics. Our validation results from clinical trial simulations, which compared original with the optimal lifestyle using an independent dataset, show that the optimal individualized patient-centered lifestyle consistently reduced 10-year CVD risks. © 2012.",2012,,Journal of Biomedical Informatics,45,6,1164-1174,,10.1016/j.jbi.2012.07.011,,#6346,Chi 2012,,,0
OHL diagnosis and maintenance automation,"Montalban, I.; Caballero, M.A.","Since late 90s, systems for monitoring and supporting work in OHL have shown up into global market offering solutions that range from simple temperature measuring devices [1] to more complex systems based on computerized imaging [2, 3]. Aim of these platforms is no other than providing operators with useful information that may ease their work when operating upon certain lines. Data acquired with those systems still needs to be integrated into existing and future architectures in a manner that, instead of flooding with information, eases tasks and decisions to be taken. But, it is worth highlighting, additional needs are to be added into already existing maintenance routines in energy transmission and distribution companies. Maintenance is one of companies' major expenses and integration of OHL monitoring solutions, if not done correctly, will require additional long-term work. Due to envisioned usage for this information and relevance of its integrity regarding line operation, early faulty sensor detection and system behaviour change characterization will be highly relevant in avoiding risky situations. Evolution of energy grids towards more intelligent approaches lead a new vision relaying on information disposition that opens a world of possibilities for data miners and artificial intelligence enthusiasts. Techniques for pre-processing and simplifying acquired in-field data need to evolve, offering reliable and useful solutions that have been successfully applied in adjacent fields [4, 5]. Applied techniques have to ensure security and minimal risk assessment though, discarding or releasing to a second plane techniques recurrently appearing into stateof- the-art literature despite their results in related areas [6, 7] due to uncertainty associated with these methods. Thus, highly reliable and trustworthy solutions need to be found, which is never an easy task. Available information combined with mathematical models may offer notorious advantages on controlling line status and triggering unexpected events, increasing confidence on applied methodologies and easing implantation of these solutions in a near future. With that in mind, aim of this work is, using existing market solutions for overhead line monitoring in combination with community approved mathematical models for dynamic line rating [8]; find solutions which in addition to real time data analysis and predictive line demand estimations, can obtain system's intrinsic parameters based on reverse engineering methodologies and turn those into a source of diagnosis for conductors and metering devices. Therefore, it would make possible early automated countermeasure planning, as well as, conductor detriment tracking, warn operators for conductor replacement or metering device fixing before any malfunctioning is identified; and thus, improve overall functioning by means of simple scheduling. Evaluation of mathematical model adaptability, sensitivity and specificity along with parameter estimation stability encouraged this work that although preliminary shows promising in further development of in-field monitoring solutions for OHL. Main aspects of different explored solutions along these lines take into account computation time, existing software integration feasibility and solution complexity; key aspects for further development and usage of mentioned methodologies. Based on evidence, usage of these parameters in order to observe both conductor behavioural detriments, as well as, malfunctioning of measuring devices, shows plausible although sound evaluation is needed for appropriate event discrimination amongst different possible scenarios. © 2013 CIGRE.

Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death of the young athlete: The controversy about the screening electrocardiogram and its innovative artificial intelligence solution,"Chang, A.C.","The preparticipation screening for athlete participation in sports typically entails a comprehensive medical and family history and a complete physical examination. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can increase the likelihood of detecting cardiac diagnoses such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this diagnostic test as part of the screening process has engendered considerable controversy. The pro position is supported by argument that international screening protocols support its use, positive diagnosis has multiple benefits, history and physical examination are inadequate, primary prevention is essential, and the cost effectiveness is justified. Although the aforementioned myriad of justifications for routine ECG screening of young athletes can be persuasive, several valid contentions oppose supporting such a policy, namely, that the sudden death incidence is very (too) low, the ECG screening will be too costly, the false-positive rate is too high, resources will be allocated away from other diseases, and manpower is insufficient for its execution. Clinicians, including pediatric cardiologists, have an understandable proclivity for avoiding this prodigious national endeavor. The controversy, however, should not be focused on whether an inexpensive, noninvasive test such as an ECG should be mandated but should instead be directed at just how these tests for young athletes can be performed in the clinical imbroglio of these disease states (with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression) with concomitant fiscal accountability and logistical expediency in this era of economic restraint. This monumental endeavor in any city or region requires two crucial elements well known to business scholars: implementation and execution. The eventual solution for the screening ECG dilemma requires a truly innovative and systematic approach that will liberate us from inadequate conventional solutions. Artificial intelligence, specifically the process termed ""machine learning"" and ""neural networking,"" involves complex algorithms that allow computers to improve the decision-making process based on repeated input of empirical data (e.g., databases and ECGs). These elements all can be improved with a national database, evidence-based medicine, and in the near future, innovation that entails a Kurzweilian artificial intelligence infrastructure with machine learning and neural networking that will construct the ultimate clinical decision-making algorithm. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",2012,,Pediatric Cardiology,33,3,428-433,,10.1007/s00246-012-0244-5,,#6351,Chang 2012,,,0
An axiomatic approach for persuasion dialogs,"Amgoud, L.; De Saint-Cyr, F.D.","Several systems were developed for supporting public persuasion dialogs where two agents with conflicting opinions try to convince an audience. For computing the outcomes of dialogs, these systems use (abstract or structured) argumentation systems that were initially developed for nonmonotonic reasoning. Despite the increasing number of such systems, there are almost no work on high level properties they should satisfy. This paper is a first attempt for defining postulates that guide the well-definition of dialog systems and that allow their comparison. We propose six basic postulates (including e.g. The finiteness of generated dialogs). We then show that this set of postulates is incompatible with those proposed for argumentation systems devoted for nonmonotonic reasoning. This incompatibility confirms the differences between persuading and reasoning. It also suggests that reasoning systems are not suitable for computing the outcomes of dialogs. © 2013 IEEE.",2013,,"Proceedings - International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence, ICTAI",,,618-625,,10.1109/ICTAI.2013.97,,#6352,Amgoud 2013,,,0

Methods: The agent was evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact intervention comparing: (a) physical activity; (b) fruit and vegetable consumption; (c) both interventions; and (d) a non-intervention control. Physical activity was assessed using daily pedometer steps. Daily servings of fruit and vegetables were assessed using the NIH/NCI self-report Fruit and Vegetable Scan. Results: Participants in the physical activity intervention increased their walking on average compared to the control group, while those in the fruit and vegetable intervention and combined intervention decreased walking. Participants in the fruit and vegetable intervention group consumed significantly more servings per day compared to those in the control group, and those in the combined intervention reported consuming more compared to those in the control group.

Methods: We analyzed major deficiencies in ehealth communication programs, illustrating how programs often fail to fully engage audiences and can even have negative consequences by undermining the effective delivery of information intended to guide health decision-making and influence adoption of health-promoting behaviors. We examined the use of AI in ehealth practices to promote immediacy and provided examples from the ChronologyMD project.

Conclusion: AI can enhance the ""immediacy"" of ehealth by humanizing health promotion efforts, promoting physical and emotional closeness, increasing authenticity and enthusiasm in health promotion efforts, supporting personal involvement in communication interactions, increasing exposure to relevant messages, reducing demands on healthcare staff, improving program efficiency, and minimizing costs. Practice implications: User-centered AI approaches, such as the use of personally involving verbal and nonverbal cues, natural language translation, virtual coaches, and comfortable human-computer interfaces can promote active information processing and adoption of new ideas. Immediacy can improve information access, trust, sharing, motivation, and behavior changes. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2013,,Patient Education and Counseling,92,2,205-210,,10.1016/j.pec.2013.04.014,,#6361,Kreps 2013,,,0
Indexing stories for conversational health interventions,"Manuvinakurike, R.; Barry, B.; Bickmore, T.","Personal stories encoding health information are an effective tool for promoting health behavior change. As millions of stories about health are accumulated daily in blogs and in social networks online there is an opportunity to harvest and index a large database of health stories for interventions. We envision such a database increasing user education, engagement, motivation and rapport in our conversational agent-based health intervention systems. In this paper we propose a model of indexing health stories based on health behavior change theory, enhanced demographies and quality metrics.

Persuasion strategies for argumentation about plans,"Medellin-Gasque, R.; Atkinson, K.; Bench-Capon, T.","In this paper we offer a proposal to enable agents to discuss the suitability of plans based on an argumentation scheme and associated critical questions. The detail encompassed by the argumentation scheme means that there is a large number of critical questions, and so dialogues may in principle be very lengthy. To improve the efficiency of dialogues we present two strategies for selecting questions. We have implemented the system and here present results showing how both strategies are effective in reducing the number of questions required to reach agreement, although their relative effectiveness is dependent on characteristics of the problem. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

Understanding and applying trigger piggybacking for persuasive technologies,"Priyadarshy, A.; Nguyen-Ngo, D.","This paper presents a new methodology for designing motivation-augmenting products along with two example cases. Like the tiny habits methodology, trigger piggybacking builds upon the Fogg Behavior Model but unlike the tiny habits methodology it incorporates a Shikakelogical approach to behavior change. Trigger piggybacking claims that a trigger rooted in a value system will produce long-term continuous behavior change. By embodying a relevant value system, the trigger reinforces values and leaves itself open to interpretation. This openness is the key to driving a user's desire to perform a behavior. Trigger piggybacking adds to the toolkit of those that design persuasive technologies. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.",2013,,AAAI Spring Symposium - Technical Report,SS-13-06,,79-82,,,,#6365,Priyadarshy 2013,,,0
A strategy for efficient persuasion dialogues,"Atkinson, K.; Bench-Capon, P.; Bench-Capon, T.","Several dialogue types, including inquiry, persuasion and deliberation, transfer information between agents so that their beliefs and opinions may be revised. The speech acts in different dialogue types have different pragmatic implications. For a representative sub-type of persuasion dialogues we consider how they can be conducted efficiently, in terms of minimising the expected transfer of information, and develop a strategy for efficient persuasion by exploiting the pragmatic implications.

Design Single-blind block-randomized controlled trial stratified according to clinic site and health literacy status. Setting Three urban ambulatory care practices at Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September 2011. Participants Older adults (N = 263; mean age 71.3; 61% female; 63% African American; 51% high school diploma or less). Intervention ECA participants were provided with portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for 2 months and were directed to connect their pedometers to the computer using a data cable and interact with a computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 10 months. Control participants were given a control pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants were also provided with pedometers. Measurements The primary outcome was average daily step count for the 30 days before the 12-month interview. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count for the 30 days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes were also stratified according to health literacy level. Results ECA participants walked significantly more steps than control participants at 2 months (adjusted mean 4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P =.01), but this effect waned by 12 months (3,861 vs 3,383, P =.09). For participants with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group walked significantly more than controls at both 2 months (P =.03) and 12 months (P =.02), while those with inadequate health literacy failed to show significant differences between treatment groups at either time point.

Information behavior in stages of exercise behavior change,"Hirvonen, N.; Huotari, M.-L.; Niemelä, R.; Korpelainen, R.","This study augments the transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavior change with the concepts of information behavior and employs this framework to understand young men's needs for and practices of obtaining and avoiding information on physical activity and exercise in relation to their readiness to change exercise behavior. The results, based on statistical analyses of a population-based survey (N = 616) conducted in Finland, indicate that health information behavior is influenced by an individual′s stage of change in the context of physical activity and exercise. In pre-action stages (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation) where individuals do not exercise regularly and are uninformed or lack motivation, commitment, or skills to change behaviors, information is most often encountered through the passive practice of nondirected monitoring. In the action stage, where individuals have recently changed their exercise behaviors, information is obtained most frequently by active seeking. In the maintenance stage, where individuals maintain earlier adopted behaviors, information is habitually obtained through active scanning. These results support the TTM in its postulation that individuals may benefit from stage-tailored health-communication strategies. The limitations of this study include self-reported behaviors, cross-sectional study design, and a possibly biased sample. Further research is needed to explore the role of information behavior in the process of behavior change in greater detail. © 2012 ASIS&T.",2012,,Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology,63,9,1804-1819,,10.1002/asi.22704,,#6369,Hirvonen 2012,,,0

Rhetoric and ethics in the cybernetic age: The transhuman condition,"Pruchnic, J.","It has become increasingly difficult to ignore the ways that the centrality of new media and technologies – from the global networking of information systems and social media to new possibilities for altering human genetics – seem to make obsolete our traditional ways of thinking about ethics and persuasive communication inherited from earlier humanist paradigms. This book argues that rather than devoting our critical energies towards critiquing humanist touchstones, we should instead examine the ways in which media and technologies have always worked as crucial cultural forces in shaping ethics and rhetoric. Pruchnic combines this historical itinerary with critical interrogations of diverse cultural and technological sites – the logic of video games and artificial intelligence, the ethics of life extension in contemporary medicine, the transition to computer-automated trading in world stock markets, the state of critical theory in the contemporary humanities – along with innovative analyses of the works of such figures as the Greek Sophists, Kenneth Burke, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Gilles Deleuze.

Opponent modelling in persuasion dialogues,"Hadjinikolis, C.; Siantos, Y.; Modgil, S.; Black, E.; McBurney, P.","A strategy is used by a participant in a persuasion dialogue to select locutions most likely to achieve its objective of persuading its opponent. Such strategies often assume that the participant has a model of its opponents, which may be constructed on the basis of a participant's accumulated dialogue experience. However in most cases the fact that an agent's experience may encode additional information which if appropriately used could increase a strategy's efficiency, is neglected. In this work, we rely on an agent's experience to define a mechanism for augmenting an opponent model with information likely to be dialectally related to information already contained in it. Precise computation of this likelihood is exponential in the volume of related information. We thus describe and evaluate an approximate approach for computing these likelihoods based on Monte-Carlo simulation.",2013,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,,,164-170,,,,#6373,Hadjinikolis 2013,,,0

I can help you change! An empathic virtual agent delivers behavior change health interventions,"Lisetti, C.; Amini, R.; Yasavur, U.; Rishe, N.","We discuss our approach to developing a novel modality for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for behavior change in the form of a personalized On-Demand VIrtual Counselor (ODVIC), accessed over the internet. ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user's during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change-the Drinker's Check-Up (DCU)-whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users' evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions.

"Information-seeking, curiosity, and attention: Computational and neural mechanisms","Gottlieb, J.; Oudeyer, P.-Y.; Lopes, M.; Baranes, A.","Intelligent animals devote much time and energy to exploring and obtaining information, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We review recent developments on this topic that have emerged from the traditionally separate fields of machine learning, eye movements in natural behavior, and studies of curiosity in psychology and neuroscience. These studies show that exploration may be guided by a family of mechanisms that range from automatic biases toward novelty or surprise to systematic searches for learning progress and information gain in curiosity-driven behavior. In addition, eye movements reflect visual information searching in multiple conditions and are amenable for cellular-level investigations. This suggests that the oculomotor system is an excellent model system for understanding information-sampling mechanisms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",2013,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,17,11,585-593,,10.1016/j.tics.2013.09.001,,#6377,Gottlieb 2013,,,0

Human values for authorizing persuasive multimedia contents,"Lee, S.Y.; Lee, J.O.","This paper attempts to answer what should be taken into consideration to authorize persuasive multimedia contents, especially in the ad domain. Being persuasive is the essential property of ads, as simply delivering information may not be sufficient to persuade those who are exposed to them. On authorizing persuasive multimedia contents, much has been discussed from a technological and technical view point but so far very little has been done from a cognitive view point. What is suggested in this paper for the purpose of authorizing persuasive multimedia contents is the value most desiredproposed under the name of utopic value. Everyone pursues the utopic value in the decision-making process. However, what constitutes this value is not, however, fixed. It varies according to contexts. In this paper, this variation is explained in terms of value shifting.

Adapting ISA system warnings to enhance user acceptance,"Jiménez, F.; Liang, Y.; Aparicio, F.","Inappropriate speed is a major cause of traffic accidents. Different measures have been considered to control traffic speed, and intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) systems are one of the alternatives. These systems know the speed limits and try to improve compliance with them. This paper deals with an informative ISA system that provides the driver with an advance warning before reaching a road section with singular characteristics that require a lower safe speed than the current speed. In spite of the extensive tests performed using ISA systems, few works show how warnings can be adapted to the driver. This paper describes a method to adapt warning parameters (safe speed on curves, zone of influence of a singular stretch, deceleration process and reaction time) to normal driving behavior. The method is based on a set of tests with and without the ISA system. This adjustment, as well as the analysis of driver acceptance before and after the adaptation and changes in driver behavior (changes in speed and path) resulting from the tested ISA regarding a driver's normal driving style, is shown in this paper. The main conclusion is that acceptance by drivers increased significantly after redefining the warning parameters, but the effect of speed homogenization was not reduced. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,,Accident Analysis and Prevention,48,,37-48,,10.1016/j.aap.2010.05.017,,#6381,Jiménez 2012,,,0

'What matters to Andrew'. The problem of premissary relevance in automated health advisors. Insights from pragma-dialectics,"Rubinelli, S.; Labrie, N.H.M.; O'Keefe, D.J.","Objective: To influence health behavior, communication has to be relevant on an individual level and, thus, fulfill the requirement of premissary relevance. This paper attempts to enrich the design of automated health advisors by, first, reviewing main solutions to the challenge of premissary relevance found in the literature and, second, highlighting the value in this field of the theory of argumentation known as pragma-dialectics. Methods: A conceptual paper grounded in persuasion research and argumentation theory. Results: Automated health advisors enable argumentative exchanges with users. But there is a need to design these systems as to make them work in an audience-centered perspective. The theory of pragma-dialectics can be used to analyze the factors that favor or hinder the agreement of users to engage in certain health behaviors, and to identify argumentation strategies targeted to behavior change. Conclusion: Pragma-dialectics can be used to enhance the design of automated health advisors as it operationalizes the dialogical nature of the reasoning process that can influence health behavior. Practice implications: Premissary relevance is a challenge of communication for health promotion at large that can be promisingly addressed through synergies among persuasion research, argumentation theory and Artificial Intelligence. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2013,,Patient Education and Counseling,92,2,218-222,,10.1016/j.pec.2013.04.013,,#6383,Rubinelli 2013,,,0

We apply this approach to characterize the communication between members of QuitNet, an online social network for smoking cessation.

"What-ifs, if-whats and maybes: Sketch of ubiquitous collaborative decision support technology","Rasouli, S.; Timmermans, H.","Since its introduction, geographic information science has witnessed a tremendous growth and can build on enormous achievements (e.g. Cheng et al. 2012). Current geographic information systems and the decision support systems and models that have been accompanying these systems have a strong ‘geography’ identity, typical of the era in which geographic information system were introduced. Systems are mostly based on spatial entities (mostly grids or polygons). To the extent that commercial and open source geographic information systems have been enriched with models, a similar strong geographic flavor can be discerned. Most models of spatial choice behavior are related to the aggregate spatial interaction models, models of land use change are often based on cellular automata. The question then becomes whether dominant spatial decision support systems, fundamentally based on aggregate spatial interaction, cellular automata and similar models, are suitable for adequately predicting consumer response. We content that in light of the increasing complexity of the decision making process and increasing personalization of decisions and lifestyles, these systems and their underlying models have increasingly become inadequate and obsolete. The field should shift to the development of more integral microscopic models of choice behavior, allowing more integral policy performance assessments. Moreover, mobile computing should allow and stimulate the development of real-time information and decision support systems that support the management of urban functions and include persuasive computing. Uncertainty analysis should play an integral role in these developments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.",2013,,Lecture Notes in Geoinformation and Cartography,0,,19-29,,10.1007/978-3-642-37533-0_2,,#6386,Rasouli 2013,,,0

User behaviour captured by mobile phones,"Teeuw, W.B.; Koolwaaij, J.; Peddemors, A.","The i-Zone initiative proposes a new approach to urban mobility management by using the latest mobile ICT technologies. It is about mobile phones that measure and analyse user behaviour in order to influence travel behaviour. By providing feedback to the traveller (self monitoring), by information sharing, or by providing positive incentives to travellers by road authorities and other stakeholders, improved mobility in a city may be achieved. The information is targeted on individual travel behaviour, and thus allows a personalized approach to influence travel behaviour.

System personality and persuasion in human-computer dialogue,"Andrews, P.Y.","The human-computer dialogue research field has been studying interaction with computers since the early stage of Artificial Intelligence, however, research has often focused on very practical tasks to be completed with the dialogues. A new trend in the field tries to implement persuasive techniques with automated interactive agents; unlike booking a train ticket, for example, such dialogues require the system to show more anthropomorphic qualities. The influences of such qualities in the effectiveness of persuasive dialogue is only starting to be studied. In this article we focus on one important perceived trait of the system: personality, and explore how it influences the persuasiveness of a dialogue system. We introduce a new persuasive dialogue system and combine it with a state of the art personality utterance generator. By doing so, we can control the systems extraversion personality trait and observe its influence on the users perception of the dialogue and its output. In particular, we observe that the users extraversion influences their perception of the dialogue and its persuasiveness, and that the perceived personality of the system can affect its trustworthiness and persuasiveness. We believe that theses observations will help to set up guidelines to tailor dialogue systems to the users interaction expectations and improve the persuasive interventions. © 2012 ACM.",2012,,ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems,2,2,,,10.1145/2209310.2209315,,#6392,Andrews 2012,,,0
"Experience, engagement, and Shikake","Takatalo, J.; Miller, D.; Häkkinen, J.","Shikake provides an interesting way to trigger behavior change in various contexts. However, the way a Shikake triggers behavior is a complex process. We may become interested in a Shikake because it unambiguously supports some of our abilities, it is fun, or just by following other people's behavior when they are interacting with it. Similarly, the outcomes of the interaction can greatly vary from sustainable learning to vanishing curiosity. Nonetheless, each time we interact with a Shikake, we experience the world around us. Consequently, the quality of the mental effort and the quantity of the behavioral effort the Shikake triggers determines our level of engagement in an event. Here we present a psychological design framework that connects Shikake triggers, experience, and behaviors in an engagement space. The contextual focus is on education and learning. An experiential level inspection reveals both conscious and unconscious perceptual pathways, which are especially crucial to understand when learning behaviors are triggered. The framework provides heuristics of what to consider when studying, evaluating, and designing engagement in human-environment interaction processes from a trigger to the resulting experience and behavior. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.",2013,,AAAI Spring Symposium - Technical Report,SS-13-06,,95-100,,,,#6393,Takatalo 2013,,,0
Argument from analogy in legal rhetoric,"Walton, D.","This paper applies recent work on scripts and stories developed as tools of evidential reasoning in artificial intelligence to model the use of argument from analogy as a rhetorical device of persuasion. The example studied is Gerry Spence's closing argument in the case of Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, said to be the most persuasive closing argument ever used in an American trial. It is shown using this example how argument from analogy is based on a similarity premise where similarity between two cases is modeled using the device of a story scheme from the hybrid theory of legal evidential reasoning (Bex in Arguments, stories and criminal evidence: a formal hybrid theory. Springer, Dordrecht 2011).

Virtual training and coaching of health behavior: Example from mindfulness meditation training,"Hudlicka, E.","Objective: Computer-based virtual coaches are increasingly being explored for patient education, counseling, and health behavior training and coaching. The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate a Virtual Mindfulness Coach for training and coaching in mindfulness meditation. Methods: The coach was implemented as an embodied conversational character, providing mindfulness training and coaching via mixed initiative, text-based, natural language dialog with the student, and emphasizing affect-adaptive interaction. (The term 'mixed initiative dialog' refers to a human-machine dialog where either can initiate a conversation or a change in the conversation topic.). Results: Findings from a pilot evaluation study indicate that the coach-based training is more effective in helping students establish a regular practice than self-administered training using written and audio materials. The coached group also appeared to be in more advanced stages of change in terms of the transtheoretical model, and have a higher sense of self-efficacy regarding establishment of a regular mindfulness practice. Conclusion: These results suggest that virtual coach-based training of mindfulness is both feasible, and potentially more effective, than a self-administered program. Of particular interest is the identification of the specific coach features that contribute to its effectiveness. Practice implications: Virtual coaches could provide easily accessible and cost-effective customized training for a range of health behaviors. The affect-adaptive aspect of these coaches is particularly relevant for helping patients establish long-term behavior changes. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",2013,,Patient Education and Counseling,92,2,160-166,,10.1016/j.pec.2013.05.007,,#6396,Hudlicka 2013,,,0
Controlling three agents in a quarrel: Lessons learnt,"Brom, C.; Babor, P.; Popelová, M.; Bída, M.; Tomek, J.; Gemrot, J.","Steering behaviours can be used to position 3D embodied agents in small groups engaged in relatively simple social interactions such as in group conversation or walking while talking. Less is known about scaling these mechanisms for situations with complex dynamics requiring agents to perform actions beyond walking, turning, talking and gesturing. Here, we present a model for controlling three agents in an example of such a situation: a vigorous quarrel. The model combines a general steering behaviour for keeping the three agents in a triangular formation with a probabilistic two-level hierarchical state machine (hFSM) for unfolding the quarrel by means of changing parameters of the steering behaviour and issuing actions to the agents. The model has been implemented using UnrealEngine2Runtime on the example of a boy dating two girls at the same time who do not know about each other. The user can influence the course of the quarrel by changing attitudes among the agents. To create a list of the agents' actions and the hFSM, we video-taped about 40 episodes in which three actors improvised on the topic of the quarrel, and we manually annotated the videos. The evaluation with 67 human participants indicates that the model produces outcomes comprehensible and believable even for persons with limited previous experience with 3D graphics. On a more general level, this paper suggests that augmenting steering behaviours by a non-trivial higher-level controller is a feasible approach to modelling behaviour of 3D agents interacting in small groups in a complex way and presents a possible workflow for developing scenes featuring such agents. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2012,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),7660 LNCS,,158-169,,10.1007/978-3-642-34710-8_15,,#6397,Brom 2012,,,0
Testimony and argument: A bayesian perspective,"Hahn, U.; Oaksford, M.; Harris, A.J.L.","Philosophers have become increasingly interested in testimony (e.g. Coady, Testimony: A philosophical study. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992; Kusch & Lipton, Stud Hist Philos Sci 33:209–217).

Who does what on the Web: A large-scale study of browsing behavior,"Goel, S.; Hofman, J.M.; Sirer, M.I.","As theWeb has become integrated into daily life, understanding how individuals spend their time online impacts domains ranging from public policy to marketing. It is difficult, however, to measure even simple aspects of browsing behavior via conventional methods-including surveys and site-level analytics-due to limitations of scale and scope. In part addressing these limitations, large-scale Web panel data are a relatively novel means for investigating patterns of Internet usage. In one of the largest studies of browsing behavior to date, we pair Web histories for 250,000 anonymized individuals with user-level demographics-including age, sex, race, education, and income-to investigate three topics. First, we examine how behavior changes as individuals spend more time online, showing that the heaviest users devote nearly twice as much of their time to social media relative to typical individuals. Second, we revisit the digital divide, finding that the frequency with which individuals turn to theWeb for research, news, and healthcare is strongly related to educational background, but not as closely tied to gender andethnicity. Finally, we demonstrate that browsing histories are a strong signal for inferring user attributes, including ethnicity and household income, a result that may be leveraged to improve ad targeting.

When and Why Might a Computer-aided Detection (CAD) System Interfere with Visual Search? An Eye-tracking Study,"Drew, T.; Cunningham, C.; Wolfe, J.M.","Rational and Objectives: Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are intended to improve performance. This study investigates how CAD might actually interfere with a visual search task. This is a laboratory study with implications for clinical use of CAD. Methods: Forty-seven naive observers in two studies were asked to search for a target, embedded in 1/f2.4 noise while we monitored their eye movements. For some observers, a CAD system marked 75% of targets and 10% of distractors, whereas other observers completed the study without CAD. In experiment 1, the CAD system's primary function was to tell observers where the target might be. In experiment 2, CAD provided information about target identity. Results: In experiment 1, there was a significant enhancement of observer sensitivity in the presence of CAD (t(22) = 4.74, P < .001), but there was also a substantial cost. Targets that were not marked by the CAD system were missed more frequently than equivalent targets in no-CAD blocks of the experiment (t(22) = 7.02, P < .001). Experiment 2 showed no behavioral benefit from CAD, but also no significant cost on sensitivity to unmarked targets (t(22) = 0.6, P = NS). Finally, in both experiments, CAD produced reliable changes in eye movements: CAD observers examined a lower total percentage of the search area than the no-CAD observers (experiment 1: t(48) = 3.05, P < .005; experiment 2: t(50) = 7.31, P < .001). Conclusions: CAD signals do not combine with observers' unaided performance in a straightforward manner. CAD can engender a sense of certainty that can lead to incomplete search and elevated chances of missing unmarked stimuli. © 2012 AUR.",2012,,Academic Radiology,19,10,1260-1267,,10.1016/j.acra.2012.05.013,,#6413,Drew 2012,,,0

On the outcomes of multiparty persuasion,"Bonzon, E.; Maudet, N.","In recent years, several bilateral protocols regulating the exchange of arguments between agents have been proposed. When dealing with persuasion, the objective is to arbitrate among conflicting viewpoints. Often, these debates are not entirely predetermined from the initial situation, which means that agents have a chance to influence the outcome in a way that fits their individual preferences. This paper introduces a simple and intuitive protocol for multiparty argumentation, in which several (more than two) agents are equipped with argumentation systems. We further assume that they focus on a (unique) argument (or issue) - thus making the debate two-sided - but do not coordinate. We study what outcomes can (or will) be reached if agents follow this protocol. We investigate in particular under which conditions the debate is pre-determined or not, and whether the outcome coincides with the result obtained by merging the argumentation systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",2012,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),7543 LNAI,,86-101,,10.1007/978-3-642-33152-7_6,,#6417,Bonzon 2012,,,0

Second, it provides a model for longer branching dialogues (in terms of number of dialogue turns and number of slots) than the usual slot filling dialogue interactions currently available (e.g. tourist information domain). In addition, the model forms the basis for the generation of a richly annotated dialogue corpus, which is essential for applying optimization methods based on reinforcement learning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.",2013,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),8108 LNAI,,92-105,,10.1007/978-3-642-40415-3_8,,#6418,Yasavur 2013,,,0
Can enforced behaviour change attitudes?: Exploring the influence of Intelligent Speed Adaptation,"Chorlton, K.; Conner, M.","The Theory of Planned Behaviour model (Ajzen, 1985) was used to determine whether long-term experience with Intelligent Speed Adaption (ISA) prompts a change in speed related cognitions. The study examines data collected as part of a project examining driver behaviour with an intervening but overridable ISA system. Data was collected in four six-month field trials. The trials followed an A-B-A design (28 days driving with no ISA, 112 days driving with ISA, 28 days driving without ISA) to monitor changes in speeding behaviour as a result of the ISA system and any carry-over effect of the system. Findings suggested that following experience with the system, drivers' intention to speed significantly weakened, beyond the removal of ISA support. Drivers were also less likely to believe that exceeding the speed would 'get them to their destination more quickly' and less likely to believe that 'being in a hurry' would facilitate speeding. However, the positive change in intentions and beliefs failed to translate into behaviour. Experience with the ISA system significantly reduced the percentage of distance travelled whilst exceeding the speed limit but this effect was not evident when the ISA support was removed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.",2012,,Accident Analysis and Prevention,48,,49-56,,10.1016/j.aap.2010.06.007,,#6419,Chorlton 2012,,,0

Active assistance technology for health-related behavior change: An interdisciplinary review,"Kennedy, C.M.; Powell, J.; Payne, T.H.; Ainsworth, J.; Boyd, A.; Buchan, I.","Background: Information technology can help individuals to change their health behaviors. This is due to its potential for dynamic and unbiased information processing enabling users to monitor their own progress and be informed about risks and opportunities specific to evolving contexts and motivations. However, in many behavior change interventions, information technology is underused by treating it as a passive medium focused on efficient transmission of information and a positive user experience. Objective: To conduct an interdisciplinary literature review to determine the extent to which the active technological capabilities of dynamic and adaptive information processing are being applied in behavior change interventions and to identify their role in these interventions. Methods: We defined key categories of active technology such as semantic information processing, pattern recognition, and adaptation. We conducted the literature search using keywords derived from the categories and included studies that indicated a significant role for an active technology in health-related behavior change. In the data extraction, we looked specifically for the following technology roles: (1) dynamic adaptive tailoring of messages depending on context, (2) interactive education, (3) support for client self-monitoring of behavior change progress, and (4) novel ways in which interventions are grounded in behavior change theories using active technology. Results: The search returned 228 potentially relevant articles, of which 41 satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that significant research was focused on dialog systems, embodied conversational agents, and activity recognition. The most covered health topic was physical activity. The majority of the studies were early-stage research. Only 6 were randomized controlled trials, of which 4 were positive for behavior change and 5 were positive for acceptability. Empathy and relational behavior were significant research themes in dialog systems for behavior change, with many pilot studies showing a preference for those features. We found few studies that focused on interactive education (3 studies) and self-monitoring (2 studies). Some recent research is emerging in dynamic tailoring (15 studies) and theoretically grounded ontologies for automated semantic processing (4 studies). Conclusions: The potential capabilities and risks of active assistance technologies are not being fully explored in most current behavior change research. Designers of health behavior interventions need to consider the relevant informatics methods and algorithms more fully. There is also a need to analyze the possibilities that can result from interaction between different technology components. This requires deep interdisciplinary collaboration, for example, between health psychology, computer science, health informatics, cognitive science, and educational methodology. © Catriona M Kennedy, John Powell, Thomas H Payne, John Ainsworth, Alan Boyd, Iain Buchan.",2012,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,14,3,E80,,10.2196/jmir.1893,,#6427,Kennedy 2012,,,0
Efficiency in persuasion dialogues,"Atkinson, K.; Bench-Capon, P.; Bench-Capon, T.","Inquiry, Persuasion and Deliberation Dialogues are all designed to transfer information between agents so that their beliefs and opinions may be revised in the light of the new information, and all make use of a similar set of speech acts. These dialogues also have significant differences. We define success conditions for some different dialogue types in this family and note the pragmatic implications of the speech acts they employ. Focusing on persuasion we consider how successful persuasion dialogues can be conducted efficiently, in terms of minimising the expected transfer of information. We observe that a strategy for efficient persuasion can be developed by considering the pragmatic implications.

Similarity measure for anomaly detection and comparing human behaviors,"Anderson, D.T.; Ros, M.; Keller, J.M.; Cuéllar, M.P.; Popescu, M.; Delgado, M.; Vila, A.","Herein, we put forth a new similarity measure for anomaly detection and for comparing human behaviors based on the theories of learning automata, comparison of soft partitions, and temporal probabilistic order relations. In particular, focus is placed on monitoring individuals in a home setting for their own well-being. This work is a high-level investigation focused on the structure of human behavior. Examples demonstrate the utility of this approach for (1) understanding the similarity of pairs of behaviors for an individual (or alternatively between individuals) and (2) detecting significant change between changing behavior and a baseline model.

That is, persuasive technologies are intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior or both, and aim at persuading human agents to behave in socially-valued ways, by giving information, providing feedback, and taking over actions (e.g., a fuel consumption feedback device in a car). More and more, ubiquitous technology surrounds the users in their everyday life, which allows for persuasive interventions at the right time and in the right place, without the necessity of the (full) attention of the user.

Dynamic targeting in an online social medium,"Laflin, P.; Mantzaris, A.V.; Ainley, F.; Otley, A.; Grindrod, P.; Higham, D.J.","Online human interactions take place within a dynamic hierarchy, where social influence is determined by qualities such as status, eloquence, trustworthiness, authority and persuasiveness. In this work, we consider topic-based Twitter interaction networks, and address the task of identifying influential players. Our motivation is the strong desire of many commerical entities to increase their social media presence by engaging positively with pivotal bloggers and Tweeters. After discussing some of the issues involved in extracting useful interaction data from a Twitter feed, we define the concept of an active node subnetwork sequence. This provides a time-dependent, topic-based, summary of relevant Twitter activity. For these types of transient interactions, it has been argued that the flow of information, and hence the influence of a node, is highly dependent on the timing of the links. Some nodes with relatively small bandwidth may turn out to be key players because of their prescience and their ability to instigate follow-on network activity. To simulate a commercial application, we build an active node subnetwork sequence based on key words in the area of travel and holidays. We then compare a range of network centrality measures, including a recently proposed version that accounts for the arrow of time, with respect to their ability to rank important nodes in this dynamic setting. The centrality rankings use only connectivity information (who Tweeted whom, when), but if we post-process the results by examining account details, we find that the time-respecting, dynamic, approach, which looks at the follow-on flow of information, is less likely to be ‘misled’ by accounts that appear to generate large numbers of automatic Tweets with the aim of pushing out web links. We then benchmark these algorithmically derived rankings against independent feedback from five social media experts who judge Twitter accounts as part of their professional duties. We find that the dynamic centrality measures add value to the expert view, and indeed can be hard to distinguish from an expert in terms of who they place in the top ten. We also highlight areas where the algorithmic approach can be refined and improved. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.",2012,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),7710,,82-95,,10.1007/978-3-642-35386-4_7,,#6432,Laflin 2012,,,0

Philosophy of Biotechnology,"Van den Belt, H.","The term “techno science” is increasingly being used to refer to such contemporary disciplines as information and communication technology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and to biotechnology. The popularity of the term is illustrated by the fact that even a group of social scientists reporting on the changing attitudes of European public towards biotechnology invokes the term to mark the departure of this particular field from the norms and values once held to be essential to the ethos of science. The evident commercialization and industrialization of biotechnology, with the pursuit of private knowledge, patents and profits, hardly meets Merton's criteria of universalism, communism, disinterestedness and skepticism, or the public's expectations about the values, accountability and social responsibility of science. Biotechnology has become a techno science, a commercial enterprise accountable to financial markets and to shareholders.

Certain types of structural closures significantly outperform recommendations based on traditional collaborative filtering, behavioral, and similarity features. We find that sharing an audience with someone is a surprisingly compelling reason to follow them, and that similarity is much less persuasive. We also find evidence that organic network growth is very different from how users behave when they are prompted to connect to new people.

Navigating the terrain of sustainable HCI,"Disalvo, C.; Sengers, P.; Brynjarsdóttir, H.","A map of the current landscape of sustainable HCI that differentiates and organizes the approaches that have emerged in the field and describes emerging topics of dissension are discussed. A dominant genre in sustainable HCI is persuasive technology: systems that attempt to convince users to behave in a more sustainable way. The forms of these systems range from devices and physical artifacts to visualizations to instrumented environments and intelligent agents. Sustainable interaction design (SID) uses sustainability as a lens to rethink the role and outcomes of design. Differences arise around how to approach users and their lifestyles. There is even a noticeable lack of connection between sustainable HCI and other technical fields. These issues prompt questions of what the boundaries of sustainable HCI are or should be. There is a clear need for sustainable HCI to draw on the expertise of researchers in areas such as hardware, environmental information systems, and community information systems, and there is also a clear need for HCI expertise in those areas.",2010,,Interactions,17,4,22-25,,10.1145/1806491.1806497,,#6447,Disalvo 2010,,,0
Algorithms and complexity results for persuasive argumentation,"Kim, E.J.; Ordyniak, S.; Szeider, S.","The study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as introduced by Dung (1995) [1] has become one of the most active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning. A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (2003) [8], extends Dungs framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (2007) [12]. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Persuasion in ambient intelligence,"Kaptein, M.C.; Markopoulos, P.; de Ruyter, B.; Aarts, E.","Although the field of persuasive technologies has lately attracted a lot of attention, only recently the notion of ambient persuasive technologies was introduced. Ambient persuasive technologies can be integrated into every aspect of life, and as such have greater persuasive power than the traditional box like machines. This article discusses ambient persuasion and poses a model that structures the knowledge from social sciences on persuasion, attitude change, and behavior change. Using this model the challenges of ambient persuasive technologies to fulfill its persuasive promises are identified. From the ambient persuasion model it is clear that ambient persuasive technologies can go beyond traditional persuasive technologies by being context and situational aware, by interpreting individual differences between users, and by being a social actor in their own right. © The Author(s) 2009.",2010,,Journal of Ambient Intelligence and Humanized Computing,1,1,43-56,,10.1007/s12652-009-0005-3,,#6450,Kaptein 2010,,,0
Predictive analysis for social processes,"Glass, K.; Colbaugh, R.; Engi, D.","This paper presents a new approach to predictive analysis for social processes. A key element of the proposed methodology is proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the persuasiveness of an argument) and the social dynamics which is its realization (e.g., the way the argument propagates through a segment of society). We show that this interplay can be modeled within a novel multi-scale framework that is sociologically and mathematically sensible, expressive, illuminating, and amenable to formal analysis. We then develop a scientifically rigorous, computationally tractable approach to predictive analysis. Among other capabilities, this analytic approach enables assessment of process predictability, identification of measurables which have predictive power, discovery of reliable early indicators for events of interest, and scalable, robust prediction. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study involving early warning analysis for mobilization/protest events. © 2009, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.",2009,,AAAI Spring Symposium - Technical Report,SS-09-09,,36-41,,,,#6451,Glass 2009,,,0
Designing embodied cues for dialogue with robots,"Mutlu, B.","Of all computational systems, robots are unique in their ability to afford embodied interaction using the wider range of human communicative cues. Research on human communication provides strong evidence that embodied cues, when used effectively, elicit social, cognitive, and task outcomes such as improved learning, rapport, motivation, persuasion, and collaborative task performance. While this connection between embodied cues and key outcomes provides a unique opportunity for design, taking advantage of it requires a deeper understanding of how robots might use these cues effectively and the limitations in the extent to which they might achieve such outcomes through embodied interaction. This article aims to underline this opportunity by providing an overview of key embodied cues and outcomes in human communication and describing a research program that explores how robots might generate high-level social, cognitive, and task outcomes such as learning, rapport, and persuasion using embodied cues such as verbal, vocal, and nonverbal cues.

Can you be persuaded? Individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion,"Kaptein, M.; Markopoulos, P.; De Ruyter, B.; Aarts, E.","Persuasive technologies are growing in popularity and many designers create systems which intentionally change users attitudes or behaviors. This study shows that peoples individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, as implemented using the six persuasion principles proposed by Cialdini 2, relates to their compliance to a persuasive request which is accompanied by a persuasive cue.

Strategic Information Disclosure to People with Multiple Alternatives,"Azaria, A.; Rabinovich, Z.; Kraus, S.; Goldman, C.V.","This paper studies how automated agents can persuade humans to behave in certain ways. The motivation behind such agent's behavior resides in the utility function that the agent's designer wants to maximize and which may be different from the user's utility function. Specifically, in the strategic settings studied, the agent provides correct yet partial information about a state of the world that is unknown to the user but relevant to his decision. Persuasion games were designed to study interactions between automated players where one player sends state information to the other to persuade it to behave in a certain way. We show that this game theory based model is not sufficient to model human-agent interactions, since people tend to deviate from the rational choice. We use machine learning to model such deviation in people from this game theory based model. The agent generates a probabilistic description of the world state that maximizes its benefit and presents it to the users. The proposed model was evaluated in an extensive empirical study involving road selection tasks that differ in length, costs and congestion. Results showed that people's behavior indeed deviated significantly from the behavior predicted by the game theory based model. Moreover, the agent developed in our model performed better than an agent that followed the behavior dictated by the game-theoretical models.

Social networking sites as platforms to persuade behaviour change in domestic energy consumption,"Foster, D.; Blythe, M.; Lawson, S.; Doughty, M.","This paper describes a pilot investigation into the use of the social networking site Facebook as a platform for persuasive applications. The application domain is behaviour change in domestic energy consumption and the study focuses on determining peoples' attitudes towards the hypothetical coupling of the consumer product Wattson, which can monitor domestic electricity usage, to a Facebook application termed Watts Up. The Facebook application presents visualisations of users' own electricity consumption as well as that of their friends. Users' attitudes towards this notion were accumulated and analysed using grounded theory. Some user indications revealed negative opinions about the concept based, for instance, around privacy and confusion; however the balance of opinion appeared to favour the underlying idea that revealing other people's energy usage data would lead to competition and peer influence to reduce energy consumption.",2009,,"Adaptive and Emergent Behaviour and Complex Systems - Proceedings of the 23rd Convention of the Society for the Study of Artificial Intelligence and Simulation of Behaviour, AISB 2009",,,22-27,,,,#6460,Foster 2009,,,0

Towards a dialectical approach for conversational agents in selling situations,"Morge, M.; Abdel-Naby, S.; Beaufils, B.","The use of virtual agents to intelligently interface with online customers of e-commerce businesses is remarkably increasing. Most of these virtual agents are designed to assist online customers while searching for information related to a specific product or service, while few agents are intended for promoting and selling a product or a service.

Persuasive decision support: Improving reliance on decision support systems,"Parkes, A.","The primary role of a decision support system is to guide and support a decision maker. As reliance on a decision support system is largely discretionary the persuasiveness of the system becomes critically important. In this paper characteristics thought to affect systems persuasiveness are examined. This paper asserts that the target and source of a decision support message, along with the design of the message itself, act to influence the persuasiveness of the decision support provided. Using a purpose built experimental platform with seventy subjects the research finds that the persuasiveness of a decision support message is varied by the perceived difficulty of the task being undertaken, and the perceived usefulness of the decision support provided. The type of decisional guidance provided also affects persuasiveness of the system; in particular, providing suggestive decisional guidance is shown to significantly improve system persuasiveness. The implications of these findings relate to the appropriate design of decision support systems, and the contexts within which a decision support system can be expected to persuade decision makers to reply on the support provided.",2009,,PACIS 2009 - 13th Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: IT Services in a Global Environment,,,,,,,#6463,Parkes 2009,,,0
Boat adaptive credit card fraud detection system,"Sherly, K.K.; Nedunchezhian, R.",Fraud is increasing with the extensive use of internet and the increase of online transactions. More advanced solutions are desired to protect financial service companies and credit card holders from constantly evolving online fraud attacks. The main objective of this paper is to construct an efficient fraud detection system which is adaptive to the behavior changes by combining classification and clustering techniques. This is a two stage fraud detection system which compares the incoming transaction against the transaction history to identify the anomaly using BOAT algorithm in the first stage. In second stage to reduce the false alarm rate suspected anomalies are checked with the fraud history database and make sure that the detected anomalies are due to fraudulent transaction or any short term change in spending profile. In this work BOAT supports incremental update of transactional database and it handles maximum fraud coverage with high speed and less cost. Proposed model is evaluated on both synthetically generated and real life data and shows very good accuracy in detecting fraud transaction. © 2010 IEEE.,2010,,"2010 IEEE International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Computing Research, ICCIC 2010",,,503-509,,10.1109/ICCIC.2010.5705824,,#6464,Sherly 2010,,,0

On preferred extension enumeration in abstract argumentation,"Nofal, S.; Dunne, P.; Atkinson, K.","For Dung's theory of abstract argumentation, algorithms have been introduced for enumerating all preferred extensions. Two specific approaches have been set out that are based on labeling arguments as: IN, OUT or UNDEC. The purpose of this paper is to improve the two existing approaches by introducing two enhancements. Firstly, we employ two more informative labels. Secondly, by using these additional labels, we describe a new scheme for how the arguments' labels change in the course of computing the preferred extensions. Supported by empirical evaluation, we argue that these modifications accelerate computations. Moreover, we show how to apply the new algorithm in the context of value-based frameworks for persuasive argument, and hence, it appears that the new algorithm is usable in other formalisms extending Dung's model. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

Methods to window data to differentiate between markov models,"Schwier, J.M.; Brooks, R.R.; Griffin, C.","In this paper, we consider how we can detect patterns in data streams that are serial Markovian, where target behaviors are Markovian, but targets may switch from one Markovian behavior to another. We want to reliably and promptly detect behavior changes. Traditional Markov-model-based pattern detection approaches, such as hidden Markov models, use maximum likelihood techniques over the entire data stream to detect behaviors. To detect changes between behaviors, we use statistical pattern matching calculations performed on a sliding window of data samples. If the window size is very small, the system will suffer from excessive false-positive rates. If the window is very large, change-point detection is delayed. This paper finds both necessary and sufficient bounds on the window size. We present two methods of calculating window sizes based on the state and transition structures of the Markov models. Two application examples are presented to verify our results. Our first example problem uses simulations to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. The second example uses models extracted from a database of consumer purchases to illustrate their use in a real application. © 2010 IEEE.",2011,,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics",41,3,650-663,,10.1109/TSMCB.2010.2076325,,#6469,Schwier 2011,,,0
Optimal path selection technique for flooding in link state routing protocol using forwarding mechanisms in MANET,,"A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous network that consists of mobile nodes that communicate with each other over wireless links. An advent of new technologies and the demand for flexibility and ease in working environment, the use of Mobile Ad hoc computing is growing fast. Besides their use, Mobile Ad hoc networks (MANET) are assumed to grow in size too. They function in independent groups, containing some tens of nodes up to several hundreds of nodes. As the network size increases, it becomes common for the nodes to be dispersed in a larger area than the radio range of individual nodes. Under such conditions, we have to employ routing techniques such that the out of range nodes may communicate with each other via intermediate nodes. This problem of routing in mobile ad hoc networks is our focus of discussion in this paper, and a protocol is proposed as a solution. However, as the greedy algorithm used in Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol will choose the nodes with stronger coverability that creates the overlap of nodes in the MultiPoint Relay (MPR) selection, which will reduce the performance of the network. Multipoint Relaying is a technique to reduce the number of redundant retransmissions while diffusing a broadcast message in the network. Optimized Multicast Routing (OMR) protocol is able to change behavior in different situations in order to improve the metric like delivery ratio of the packet and throughput. The protocol is augmented by an optimization scheme, adapted from OLSR Protocol in which only selected neighbor nodes propagate the control packets to reduce the amount of control overhead in the network. The MultiPoint Relay (MPR) based mechanism of OLSR is used to perform an Optimized Forwarding Mechanism to efficiently do the flooding of broadcast messages in the Mobile Ad hoc Network. So, the number of MPRs is a key for the performance of the OLSR. An algorithm called Necessity First Algorithm (NFA) is used to select the optimal MultiPoint Relays in OMR protocol with the goal of solving performance problem of greedy algorithm. © 2010 Kongu Engineering College.",2010,,"Proceedings of 2010 International Conference on Communication and Computational Intelligence, INCOCCI-2010",,,318-323,,,,#6470,,,,0

Psychology of persuasion,"Csapó, J.; Magyar, A.","Persuasion is the activity of demonstrating and trying to modify the behavior of at least one person through symbolic interaction. This book surveys formal models of persuasion dialog that are now widely used in argumentation and artificial intelligence as tools for the identification, analysis and evaluation of arguments. Within the sports arena, coaches and athletes routinely look for ways to improve performance. While most of these attempts tend to focus on physical practice, the role of the mind, and psychological factors such as self-efficacy, has become increasingly important. The research and theory within this area are explored and the authors make recommendations with regards to the content and delivery of pep talks. Furthermore, it is well-known that most advertising persuades by argument and most of those arguments are logical. The authors apply Gilbert's Multimodal Argumentation Model to a series of advertisements. In addition, a peculiar kind of persuasive communication is discussed: the fictitious argument between a human being and personified death. As the choice of German-speaking texts examined here exemplifies, the dialogic and rhetorically structured way of dealing with the mortal threat has been living on well into Modern times. Other chapters explore current research on regulatory fit and persuasion into the larger contexts of elaboration likelihood and transportation likelihood. Current research on how regulatory fit affects persuasion through advocacy messages and through narratives is looked at as well. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Speech acts that form a part of argumentative discourse, and in particular, of argumentative dialogue, can be seen as anchors for the establishment of inferences between propositions in the domain of discourse. Most often, the speech acts that directly give rise to inference are implicit, but can be drawn out in analysis by consideration of the type of dialogue game being played. AI approaches to argumentation often focus solely on such inferences as the means by which persuasion can be effected - but this is in contrast with psychological and rhetorical models which have long recognised the role played by extra-logical features of the dialogical context. These 'peripheral' cues can not only affect persuasive effect of the logical, 'central' argumentation, but can override and dominate it. This paper presents a theory which allows both central and peripheral aspects of argumentation to be represented in a coherent analytical account based on the sequences of speech acts which constitute dialogues.

Which narrations for persuasive technologies? Habits and procedures in Ayiti: The cost of life,"Ferri, G.; Fusaroli, R.","Ayiti: The Cost of Life is a very successful edutainment game pursuing persuasive aims through an unusually high level of difficulty. Analyzing this game, comprehending its unfolding meaning-making processes and describing its persuasive effectiveness is a challenging task1. To achieve it, it will be necessary to discuss how semiotics, ludology and procedural criticism intend narrativity in relation to games, A novel approach, based on Peirce's notion of habit, will be used to overcome some analytical shortcomings of current theories.

Mechanism design for argumentation-based persuasion,"Fan, X.; Toni, F.","Recently we have seen a few development in argumentation-based dialogue systems, but there is less research in understanding agents' strategic behaviour in dialogues. We study agent strategies by linking a specific form of argumentation-based dialogues and mechanism design. Specifically, focusing on persuasion dialogues, we show how dialogues can be mapped to concepts in mechanism design. We prove that a 'truthful' and 'thorough' dialogue strategy is a dominant strategy under specific conditions. We also prove that a mechanism using this dialogue strategy implements a 'persuasion social choice function' we define. These results show the validity of the proposed strategies for agents in persuasion and the feasibility of studying persuasion with mechanism design techniques. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

A cognitive-consistency based model of population wide attitude change,"Lakkaraju, K.; Speed, A.","Attitudes play a significant role in determining how individuals process information and behave. In this paper we have developed a new computational model of population wide attitude change that captures the social level: how individuals interact and communicate information, and the cognitive level: how attitudes and concept interact with each other. The model captures the cognitive aspect by representing each individuals as a parallel constraint satisfaction network. The dynamics of this model are explored through a simple attitude change experiment where we vary the social network and distribution of attitudes in a population.

Unconscious persuasion by Ambient Persuasive Technology: Evidence for the effectivity of subliminal feedback,"Ham, J.; Midden, C.; Beute, F.","In this paper we explore a fundamental characteristic of Ambient Persuasive Technology: Can it persuade the user without receiving the user's conscious attention? In a task consisting of 90 trials, participants had to indicate which of three household appliances uses the lowest average amount of energy. After each choice, participants in the supraliminal feedback condition received feedback about the correctness of their choice through presentation of a smiling or a sad face for 150 ms. Participants in the subliminal feedback condition received identical feedback, but the faces were presented only for 25 ms, which prohibited conscious perception of these stimuli. The final third of the participants received no feedback. In the next task, participants rated the energy consumption of all presented appliances. Results indicated that supraliminal feedback and subliminal feedback both led to more correct energy consumption ratings as compared to receiving no feedback.

Gemini: A pervasive accumulated context exergame,"Stanley, K.G.; Livingston, I.J.; Bandurka, A.; Hashemian, M.; Mandryk, R.L.","Exergames encourage physical activity, but generally require specialized hardware and prescribed activities; whereas pervasive accumulated context exergames (PACEs) allow players to choose their type of exercise, but have limited depth of play. For mass commercialization of PACEs, facilitating long-term behavioural change, we propose two requirements: that PACEs support large-scale and flexible deployment; and that the design of PACEs support staying power through long-term playability. From these requirements, we motivate six PACE design principles and use these principles to develop a multiplayer roleplaying PACE. Results from a week-long study of our game showed that by satisfying the six design principles, we can create a PACE with scalability and staying power. Our results are the first step toward creating PACEs that promotes long-term game engagement, which is needed for activity-related behaviour change. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",2011,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),6972 LNCS,,65-76,,10.1007/978-3-642-24500-8_8,,#6489,Stanley 2011,,,0

Response to a relational agent by hospital patients with depressive symptoms,"Bickmore, T.W.; Mitchell, S.E.; Jack, B.W.; Paasche-Orlow, M.K.; Pfeifer, L.M.; O'Donnell, J.","Depression affects approximately 15% of the US population, and is recognized as an important risk factor for poor outcomes among patients with various illnesses. Automated health education and behavior change programs have the potential to help address many of the shortcomings in health care. However, the role of these systems in the care of patients with depression has been insufficiently examined. In the current study, we sought to evaluate how hospitalized medical patients would respond to a computer animated conversational agent that has been developed to provide information in an empathic fashion about a patient's hospital discharge plan. In particular, we sought to examine how patients who have a high level of depressive symptoms respond to this system. Therapeutic alliance - the trust and belief that a patient and provider have in working together to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome - was used as the primary outcome measure, since it has been shown to be important in predicting outcomes across a wide range of health problems, including depression. In an evaluation of 139 hospital patients who interacted with the agent at the time of discharge, all patients, regardless of depressive symptoms, rated the agent very high on measures of satisfaction and ease of use, and most preferred receiving their discharge information from the agent compared to their doctors or nurses in the hospital. In addition, we found that patients with symptoms indicative of major depression rated the agent significantly higher on therapeutic alliance compared to patients who did not have major depressive symptoms. We conclude that empathic agents represent a promising technology for patient assessment, education and counseling for those most in need of comfort and caring in the inpatient setting. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Creatively subverting messages in posters,"Gatti, L.; Guerini, M.; Callaway, C.; Stock, O.; Strapparava, C.","Creativity is widely used in advertisements, and is meant to be appreciated by people. However creativity can also be used as a defense. When we walk in the street we are overwhelmed by messages which try to get our attention with any persuasive device at hand. As messages get ever more aggressive, often our basic cognitive defense - trying not to perceive those messages - is not sufficient. One advanced defensive technique is based on transforming the perceived message into something different (for instance irony or hyperbole) from what was originally meant in the message. In this paper we describe an implemented application for smartphones that creatively modifies the linguistic expression in a virtual copy of the poster. The mobile system is inspired by the subvertising practice of countercultural art, and aims at experiencing aesthetic pleasure that relaxes the cognitive tension of the user.",2012,,"Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Computational Creativity, ICCC 2012",,,211-215,,,,#6492,Gatti 2012,,,0

Intelligent elderly-care prototype for fall and disease detection,"Dovgan, E.; Luštrek, M.; Pogorelc, B.; Gradišek, A.; Burger, H.; Gams, M.","Background: The number of elderly people in need of help with the activities of daily living in the EU is rapidly increasing, while the number of young workers is decreasing. Elderly care will, therefore, also have to be provided by intelligent computer systems. Methods: A prototype elderly-care system, developed at the Jožef Stefan Institute, mostly as part of the Confidence project, is presented. The prototype detects falls and behavior changes in the elderly. It learns from experience and is based on intelligent interpretation of movement patterns. Tree sets of tests were performed to evaluate its properties on various subjects when engaged in normal activities, falling and imitations of several health problems under medical supervision. The key novelty was in location-based sensors and advanced intelligent methods. Results: The prototype using the Ubisense sensor system, which detects the locations of tags worn on the body, correctly recognized 96% of falls, significantly outperforming simple accelerometer-based systems. In addition, it recognized up to 99% of abnormal behavior. Conclusions: Experimental results showed that an intelligent system coupled with advanced location sensors can achieve the level of performance needed in real life. The system offers significantly better performance than commercially available solutions, and once the price of sensors decreases, its widespread application seems likely.",2011,,Zdravniski Vestnik,80,11,824-831,,,,#6494,Dovgan 2011,,,0

A Large-Scale Study on Predicting and Contextualizing Building Energy Usage,"Zico Kolter, J.; Ferreira, J.","In this paper we present a data-driven approach to modeling end user energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings. Our model is based upon a data set of monthly electricity and gas bills, collected by a utility over the course of several years, for approximately 6,500 buildings in Cambridge, MA. In addition, we use publicly available tax assessor records and geographical survey information to determine corresponding features for the buildings. Using both parametric and non-parametric learning methods, we learn models that predict distributions over energy usage based upon these features, and use these models to develop two end-user systems. For utilities or authorized institutions (those who may obtain access to the full data) we provide a system that visualizes energy consumption for each building in the city; this allows companies to quickly identify outliers (buildings which use much more energy than expected even after conditioning on the relevant predictors), for instance allowing them to target homes for potential retrofits or tiered pricing schemes. For other end users, we provide an interface for entering their own electricity and gas usage, along with basic information about their home, to determine how their consumption compares to that of similar buildings as predicted by our model. Merely allowing users to contextualize their consumption in this way, relating it to the consumption in similar buildings, can itself produce behavior changes to significantly reduce consumption.

The problem of premissary relevance,"Rubinelli, S.; Wierda, R.; Labrie, N.; O'Keefe, D.","This paper focuses on the issue of premissary relevance as a challenge faced in health promotion interventions. To promote attitude change and influence health behavior, it is crucial that we use premises that are relevant on an individual level. Relevance in argumentation refers both to the fact that the premises should relate to the standpoint at issue, as well as the interlocutors' acceptance of these premises. We claim that autonomous argumentation systems hold the promise to enable proper argumentative exchanges that capture and address what matters to individuals. To do so, however, there is a need to consider and operationalize theories of argumentation that enable a reconstruction of the different stages of argumentation. The theory of argumentation known as pragma-dialectics can offer a promising basis for the architecture of autonomous health promotion advisors.

Affecting choices in interactive storytelling,"Figueiredo, R.; Paiva, A.","This position paper brings forth the hypothesis that it is possible to use results from the social psychology's area of persuasion in order to influence the player of an interactive story in predictable ways. Several important concepts of persuasion such as how people make decisions, and how can we influence the process of decision are discussed. We end with a proposal on how to apply these results in an interactive story-telling setting. Copyright ©2010, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

A host based des approach for detecting ARP spoofing,"Barbhuiya, F.A.; Biswas, S.; Hubballi, N.; Nandi, S.","Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) based attacks are caused by compromised hosts in the LAN and mainly involve spoofing with falsified IP-MAC pairs. Since ARP is a stateless protocol such attacks are possible. Neither there are signatures available for these attacks nor any significant statistical behavior change can be observed. So existing signature or anomaly intrusion detection systems are unable to detect these type of attacks. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks, however, these techniques either make IP-MAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, violate network layering architecture etc. In this paper a host based Discrete Event System (DES) approach is proposed for detecting ARP spoofing attacks. This approach does not require any extra constraint like static IP-MAC, changing the ARP or violation of network layering architecture. © 2011 IEEE.",2011,,IEEE SSCI 2011: Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence - CICS 2011: 2011 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Cyber Security,,,114-121,,10.1109/CICYBS.2011.5949401,,#6515,Barbhuiya 2011,,,0
Types of dialogue and burdens of proof,"Walton, D.","Burden of proof has recently come to be a topic of interest in argumentation systems for artificial intelligence (Prakken and Sartor, 2006, 2007, 2009; Gordon and Walton, 2007, 2009), but so far the main work on the subject seems to be in that type of dialogue which has most intensively been investigated generally, namely persuasion dialogue. The most significant exception is probably deliberation dialogue, where some recent work has begun to tentatively investigate burden of proof in that setting. In this paper, I survey work on burden of proof in the artificial intelligence literature on argumentation, and offer some thoughts on how this work might be extended to the other types of dialogue recognized by Walton and Krabbe (1995) that so far do not appear to have been much investigated in this regard. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.

ShakeTime! A persuasive robotic game,"Vázquez, M.; May, A.; Chen, W.-H.","This paper describes a robotic game intended to persuade players to consume healthy food for an extended period of time. Peer pressure, competitiveness and deception are used as persuasive techniques. The game implied that the only factor for determining who won or lost was the players' response time. However, results were changed imperceptibly during game play to promote engagement and a longer interaction time. The ethics of deception in human-robot interactions is a topic worth discussion.

Burden of proof in deliberation dialogs,"Walton, D.","The literature in argumentation and artificial intelligence has distinguished five types of burden of proof in persuasion dialogs, but there appears to have been no serious investigation so far on how burdens of proof should be modeled in deliberation dialogs. The work in this paper is directed toward filling that gap by extending existing formal models of deliberation dialog to analyze four examples of deliberation dialog where burden of proof is at issue or poses an interesting problem. The examples are used to show (1) that the eight stages in the formal model of Hitchcock, McBurney and Parsons (2007) need to be divided into three more general stages, an opening stage, an argumentation stage and a closing stage, (2) that deliberation dialog shifts to persuasion dialog during the argumentation stage, and (3) that burden of proof is only operative during the argumentation stage. What is shown in general is that deliberation is, in the typical type of case, a mixed dialog in which there is a shift to persuasion dialog in the middle. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.",2010,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),6057 LNAI,,Jan-22,,10.1007/978-3-642-12805-9_1,,#6521,Walton 2010,,,0

Group persuasion through uncertain audience modelling,"Oren, N.; Atkinson, K.; Li, H.","In this paper we examine the problem of practical reasoning utilising Atkinson et al.'s argument scheme in situations where differences as to the desirability of social value promotion exists. We focus on the situation where a single speaker attempts to persuade a set of listeners to undertake an action, assuming that the speaker has only a probabilistic model of the listener's mental state. To achieve this, we provide a new mapping from Atkinson's argumentation scheme to a VAF, introducing a new epistemic level to the VAF. We then present a simple protocol for the interaction between a single speaker and the set of listeners. Finally, situations in which strategic reasoning is necessary for the speaker are identified. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

Exploring Text Virality in Social Networks,"Guerini, M.; Strapparava, C.; Özbal, G.","This paper aims to shed some light on the concept of virality - especially in social networks - and to provide new insights on its structure. We argue that: (a) virality is a phenomenon strictly connected to the nature of the content being spread, rather than to the influencers who spread it (b) virality is a phenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different effects of persuasive communication are comprised and they only partially overlap. To give ground to our claims, we provide initial experiments in a machine learning framework to show how various aspects of virality can be independently predicted according to content features.

Dialectical trade-offs in the design of protocols for computer-mediated deliberation,"Lewiński, M.","Ideal models of dialectical argumentation, such the pragma-dialectical critical discussion or Walton and Krabbe's persuasion dialogues, comprise of a set of rules that define reasonable argumentation under idealised conditions. Assuming such conditions, dialectical rules are meant to secure an orderly procedure for testing opinions. However, in actual circumstances violations of argumentative rules - identified as fallacies - can and do occur. Pragma-dialectics treats fallacies as ""derailments of strategic manoeuvring"", that is, contraventions of dialectical rules for a critical discussion committed by actual arguers for rhetorical gains. Hence, the predicament of actual argumentation is a possible (but not necessary) trade-off between dialectical constraints and rhetorical opportunities. In this paper I preliminarily conceptualise a different predicament that actual arguers may face. The sets of dialectical rules proposed in ideal models of argumentation are consistent and thus unproblematic, as long as they presuppose idealised conditions. However, when put to work in actual procedures for argumentation, the rules may clash with one another. For instance, the freedom to unlimitedly criticise the opponent may hinder the progress towards rational resolution of a difference of opinion. As a result, arguers may face a predicament in which the only way to observe one of the rules of reasonable argumentation is to violate another one. I call such possible clashes dialectical trade-offs, because they are clashes between dialectical rules that arise in actual circumstances of argumentation. Dialectical trade-offs are practical concerns that do not undermine the general composition and usefulness of the ideal models. Yet, they point to a practical difficulty in designing consistent and applicable protocols for reasonable argumentation. I will illustrate this difficulty by contrasting two kinds of protocols for computer-mediated deliberation: Internet forums for informal deliberation and formal models of deliberative dialogues developed within the field of Artificial Intelligence.",2011,,"Studies in Logic, Grammar and Rhetoric",23,36,225-241,,,,#6526,Lewiński 2011,,,0

Recent decline in the global land evapotranspiration trend due to limited moisture supply,"Jung, M.; Reichstein, M.; Ciais, P.; Seneviratne, S.I.; Sheffield, J.; Goulden, M.L.; Bonan, G.; Cescatti, A.; Chen, J.; De Jeu, R.; Dolman, A.J.; Eugster, W.; Gerten, D.; Gianelle, D.; Gobron, N.; Heinke, J.; Kimball, J.; Law, B.E.; Montagnani, L.; Mu, Q.; Mueller, B.; Oleson, K.; Papale, D.; Richardson, A.D.; Roupsard, O.; Running, S.; Tomelleri, E.; Viovy, N.; Weber, U.; Williams, C.; Wood, E.; Zaehle, S.; Zhang, K.","More than half of the solar energy absorbed by land surfaces is currently used to evaporate water. Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land-a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability-remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm. In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 ± 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Ni±o event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Participants demonstrated a significant increase in positive attitudes (persuasion) following the persuasive dialogue; however, this change was significantly smaller when the agent used social dialogue. Participants' perceptions of the dialogue were most positive for an ECA with social dialogue, or a text-only agent without.

Architectural mechanisms for dynamic changes of behavior selection strategies in behavior-based systems,"Scheutz, M.; Andronache, V.","Behavior selection is typically a ""built-in"" feature of behavior-based architectures and hence, not amenable to change. There are, however, circumstances where changing behavior selection strategies is useful and can lead to better performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that such dynamic changes of behavior selection mechanisms are beneficial in several circumstances. We first categorize existing behavior selection mechanisms along three dimensions and then discuss seven possible circumstances where dynamically switching among them can be beneficial. Using the agent architecture framework activation, priority, observer, and component (APOC), we show how instances of all (nonempty) categories can be captured and how additional architectural mechanisms can be added to allow for dynamic switching among them. In particular, we propose a generic architecture for dynamic behavior selection, which can integrate existing behavior selection mechanisms in a unified way. Based on this generic architecture, we then verify that dynamic behavior selection is beneficial in the seven cases by defining architectures for simulated and robotic agents and performing experiments with them. The quantitative and qualitative analyzes of the results obtained from extensive simulation studies and experimental runs with robots verify the utility of the proposed mechanisms. © 2004 IEEE.",2004,,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics",34,6,2377-2395,,10.1109/TSMCB.2004.837309,,#6535,Scheutz 2004,,,0

The Cognitive Coherence Approach for Agent Communication Pragmatics,"Pasquier, P.; Chaib-Draa, B.","Different approaches have investigated the syntax and semantic of agent communication. However, all these approaches (including : agent communication languages, conversation policies and dialogue games) have not indicated how agents should dynamically use communications.

This pragmatic theory extends and adapts the cognitive dissonance theory (a major theory of social psychology) to multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how this theory allows us to provide generic conceptual tools for the automation of both agent communicational behavior and attitude change processes.

A protocol for arguing about rejections in negotiation,"Van Veenen, J.; Prakken, H.","One form of argument-based negotiation is when agents argue about why an offer was rejected. If an agent can state a reason for a rejection of an offer, the negotiation process may become more efficient since the other agent can take this reason into account when making new offers. Also, if a reason for rejection can be disputed, the negotiation process may be of higher quality since flawed reasons may be revised as a result. This paper presents a formal protocol for negotiation in which reasons can be asked and given for rejections and in which agents can try to persuade each other that a reason is or is not acceptable. The protocol is modelled as a persuasion dialogue game embedded in a negotiation protocol. It has a social semantics since the protocol does not refer to the internal state of negotiating agents. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",2006,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),4049 LNCS,,138-153,,10.1007/11794578_9,,#6539,VanVeenen 2006,,,0

We are working on an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) which applies natural argumentation techniques to persuade users to improve their behaviour in the healthy eating domain. The ECA observes the user's attitude during the dialogue, so as to select an appropriate persuasion strategy or to respond intelligently to user's reactions to suggestions received.

We conducted a follow-up study and found that resemblance and self-esteem affect interactions with agents that resemble users.

Agent communication pragmatics: The cognitive coherence approach,"Pasquier, P.; Chaib-draa, B.","Different approaches have investigated the syntax and semantics of agent communication languages.

Instead of filling this pragmatics gap, most approaches have mainly focused on the 'structure' of dialogues even though developers are more interested in agents' capabilities of having 'useful' automated conversations with respect to their goals rather than in their abilities to structure dialogues. This led us to work on a theory of the use of conversations between agents. In this paper, we propose a pragmatics theory which extends and adapts the cognitive dissonance theory (a major theory of social psychology) to multi-agent systems by unifying it with the theory of coherence in thought and action that issues from computational philosophy of mind. Precisely, we show how this theory allows us to provide generic conceptual tools for the automation of both agent communicational behavior and attitude change processes. This new motivational model is formulated in terms of constraints and elements of cognition and allows us to define cognitive incoherences and dialogue utility measures. We show how these measures could be used to solve common problems and answer some critical questions concerning agent communication frameworks use. Finally, our exploration in applying the cognitive coherence pragmatics theory as a new communication layer over classical BDI agents is presented. It relies on our dialogue games based agent communication language (DIAGAL) and our dialogue games simulator toolbox (DGS). The resulting framework provides the necessary theoretical and practical elements for implementing our theory.

Emotional and non-emotional persuasion,"Miceli, M.; De Rosis, F.; Poggi, I.","A relevant issue in the domain of natural argumentation and persuasion is the interaction (synergic or conflicting) between ""rational"" or ""cognitive"" modes of persuasion and ""irrational"" or ""emotional"" ones. This work provides a model of general persuasion and emotional persuasion. We examine two basic modes for appealing to emotions, arguing that emotional persuasion does not necessarily coincide with irrational persuasion, and showing how the appeal to emotions is grounded on the strict and manifold relationship between emotions and goals, which is, so to say, ""exploited"" by a persuader. We describe various persuasion strategies, propose a method to formalize and represent them as oriented graphs, and show how emotional and non-emotional strategies (and also emotional and non-emotional components in the same strategy) may interact with and strengthen each other. Finally, we address the role of uncertainty in persuasion strategies and show how it can be represented in persuasion graphs.",2006,,Applied Artificial Intelligence,20,10,849-879,,10.1080/08839510600938193,,#6545,Miceli 2006,,,0
Commitment-based policies in persuasion dialogues with defeasible beliefs,"Letia, I.A.; Vartic, R.","We advance a model to express the preconditions for engaging in dialogues in terms of the agents' mental attitudes, in a defeasible logic context (beliefs are divided into strict and defeasible ones). Then, we give a protocol for the persuasion dialogue between two agents, which provides the means of identifying both false premises and logical fallacies.

The role of choice and customization on users' interaction with embodied conversational agents: Effects on perception and performance,"Xiao, J.; Stasko, J.; Catrambone, R.","We performed an empirical study exploring people's interactions with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) while performing two tasks. Conditions varied with respect to 1) whether participants were allowed to choose an agent and its characteristics and 2) the putative quality or appropriateness of the agent for the tasks. For both tasks, selection combined with the illusion of further customization significantly improved participants' overall subjective impressions of the ECAs while putative quality had little or no effect. Additionally, performance data revealed that the ECA's motivation and persuasion effects were significantly enhanced when participants chose agents to use. We found that user expectations about and perceptions of the interaction between themselves and an ECA depended very much on the individual's preconceived notions and preferences of various ECA characteristics and might deviate greatly from the models that ECA designers intend to portray.

Evaluating a realistic agent in an advice-giving task,"Berry, D.C.; Butler, L.T.; De Rosis, F.","The aim of this study was to empirically evaluate an embodied conversational agent called GRETA in an effort to answer two main questions: (1) What are the benefits (and costs) of presenting information via an animated agent, with certain characteristics, in a 'persuasion' task, compared to other forms of display? (2) How important is it that emotional expressions are added in a way that is consistent with the content of the message, in animated agents? To address these questions, a positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via GRETA, a matched human actor, GRETA's voice only (no face) or as text only. Furthermore, versions of GRETA were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in a way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message. Overall, it was found that although GRETA received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likability, presenting the message via GRETA led to the poorest memory performance among users. Importantly, however, when GRETA's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message, the negative effect on memory performance disappeared. Overall, the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Formal systems for persuasion dialogue,"Prakken, H.","This article reviews formal systems that regulate persuasion dialogues. In such dialogues two or more participants aim to resolve a difference of opinion, each trying to persuade the other participants to adopt their point of view. Systems for persuasion dialogue have found application in various fields of computer science, such as non-monotonic logic, artificial intelligence and law, multi-agent systems, intelligent tutoring and computer-supported collaborative argumentation. Taking a game-theoretic view on dialogue systems, this review proposes a formal specification of the main elements of dialogue systems for persuasion and then uses it to critically review some of the main formal systems for persuasion. The focus of this review will be on regulating the interaction between agents rather than on the design and behaviour of individual agents within a dialogue. © 2006, Cambridge University Press.",2006,,Knowledge Engineering Review,21,2,163-188,,10.1017/S0269888906000865,,#6552,Prakken 2006,,,0

Behavioural changes in students participating in an upper secondary education program using unmodified computer games as the primary teaching tool,"Wiklund, M.","The extensive use of computer games have been suggested to induce behavioural differences in the players as a result of neuroplasticity. Such changes, if present, suggests that computer games may be ideally suited as teaching tools for students having grown up with this technology. Using computer games extensively in the education system would in turn increase the gaming exposure significantly, even further accentuating any such neuroplastically mediated behavioural changes. To obtain information on possible changes in student behaviour patterns in key areas, an empirical study was conducted. Students participating in a test project extensively using computer games as teaching tools, were interviewed about both games related and other key behaviours. Results show some changed behaviours in the studied areas, such as decreased television watching habits and a shift from FPS to MMORPG as favourite game genre. While being consistent with computer games being able to induce behavioural changes through neuroplasticity, other factors may also have contributed in the studied case, and more research is needed. © The University of Wolverhampton, UK.",2005,,"Proceedings of CGAMES 2005 - 7th International Conference on Computer Games: Artificial Intelligence, Animation, Mobile, Educational and Serious Games",,,66-73,,,,#6554,Wiklund 2005,,,0
Kappa calculus and evidential strength: A note on Åqvist's logical theory of legal evidence,"Shimony, S.E.; Nissan, E.","Lennart Åqvist (1992) proposed a logical theory of legal evidence, based on the Bolding-Ekelöf of degrees of evidential strength. This paper reformulates Åqvist's model in terms of the probabilistic version of the kappa calculus. Proving its acceptability in the legal context is beyond the present scope, but the epistemological debate about Bayesian Law is clearly relevant. While the present model is a possible link to that line of inquiry, we offer some considerations about the broader picture of the potential of AI & Law in the evidentiary context. Whereas probabilistic reasoning is well-researched in AI, calculations about the threshold of persuasion in litigation, whatever their value, are just the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of the modeling desiderata is arguably elsewhere, if one is to ideally make the most of AI's distinctive contribution as envisaged for legal evidence research.",2001,,Artificial Intelligence and Law,9,02-Mar,153-163,,10.1023/A:1017995916308,,#6555,Shimony 2001,,,0

Persuasive technologies in education: Improving motivation to read and write for children,"Lucero, A.; Zuloaga, R.; Mota, S.; Munoz, F.","In this paper we present an example of how principles of motivation can be designed into educational software to support students in achieving their goals. The objective of our software was to develop a reading habit in children between 8 and 11 years of age by motivating them to improve their reading and writing skills. By designing activities that integrate Gardner's Multiple Intelligence theory to our software, we were able to motivate children to read while acknowledging individual differences in their learning process. The results on presenting this software to different groups of children from the city and rural environments show how we were able to motivate students to read through the software itself and the activities it proposes, in a way that was credible and connected to the real-world environment children lived in. Our results show the importance of integrating principles from Persuasion such as similarity, tailoring and credibility, together with theories such as Gardner's in educational software to achieve motivation to read and write in children. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.",2006,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),3962 LNCS,,142-153,,10.1007/11755494_20,,#6559,Lucero 2006,,,0

Experience design,"McLellan, H.","It is essential to think about education online as comprehensively as possible. Experience design offers designers of online courses a comprehensive model informed by research and development in a number of areas that can provide a foundation for the effective design of online experiences that are functional and purposeful - and also engaging, compelling, memorable, and enjoyable. Experience design is an ancient practice, going back to the earliest human impulse to develop rituals, ceremonies, drama, and even architecture. But the design of experiences has become much more pervasive during the twentieth century. Media has played a central role, including radio, television, multimedia, and virtual reality. But experience design is also informed by new ideas in economics, especially Pine and Gilmore's notion of the emerging experience economy. And it draws upon ideas from artificial intelligence, the psychology of optimal experiences, sociology, and other areas, including electronic commerce, persuasive, human- computer interface design, drama, and digital storytelling. This article discusses key concepts and theories from all of these areas and explains how they can be adapted to the design of online learning experiences.",2000,,Cyberpsychology and Behavior,3,1,59-69,,10.1089/109493100316238,,#6561,McLellan 2000,,,0

Towards Interest-Based Negotiation,"Rahwan, I.; Sonenberg, L.; Dignum, F.","Negotiation is essential in settings where agents have conflicting interests and a desire to cooperate. In many approaches, agents are assumed to have pre-set, fixed preferences, and complete awareness of the space of possible outcomes. Such strong conditions are often not satisfied. In this paper, we argue that since preferences are adopted to pursue particular goals, one agent may influence another agent's preferences by discussing the underlying motivations and interests behind adopting the associated goals. We identify concepts that seem essential for supporting this type of dialogue. In particular we demonstrate that arguing about beliefs needs to be complemented by arguing about goals, and we begin an analysis of dialogue moves involving goals.",2003,,Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents,2,,773-780,,10.1145/860695.860699,,#6563,Rahwan 2003,,,0
A geometric semantics for dialogue game protocols for autonomous agent interactions,"McBurney, P.; Parsons, S.","Formal dialogue games studied by philosophers since the time of Aristotle have recently found application in Artificial Intelligence as the basis for protocols for interactions between autonomous software agents. For instance, game protocols have been proposed for agent dialogues involving team formation, persuasion, negotiation and deliberation. There is yet, however, no formal, mathematical theory of dialogue game protocols with which to compare two protocols or to study their formal properties. In this paper 1, we present preliminary work towards such a theory, in which we develop a geometric semantics for these protocols and, with it, define a notion of equivalence between two protocols. We then demonstrate an algebraic property of protocol equivalence, and use this to show the non-equivalence of two similar generic protocols. We also explore the relationship between finite and infinite dialogues, motivated by the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games of model theory. Our results have implications for the design and evaluation of agent dialogue-game protocols. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.

Evaluative word locations in semantic networks from news stories about Al Qaeda and implications for optimal communication messages in anti-terrorism campaigns,"Danowski, J.A.","Research on processing of negative and positive words shows that they are often processed in the same brain locations when arousal is high; that people quickly forget the source and the emotional content remains; and that people pay more attention to negative than to positive information.

Finding kairos in quitting smoking: Smokers' perceptions of warning pictures,"Räisänen, T.; Oinas-Kukkonen, H.; Pahnila, S.","This paper studies Kairos, i.e. the opportune moment to persuade, through a smoking cessation experiment. We approached 101 people, comprising of 81 smokers and 20 non-smokers, on the streets of Palo Alto, California. The participants were shown five warning pictures related to the dangers of smoking as well as a control picture. The people rated each picture based upon how strongly they felt they were affected by the pictures. The results indicate that the opportune moment to show these pictures is not when the people already are smoking but rather much earlier. Quite interestingly, the affect of this intervention was stronger on women than men.

Applying preferences to dialogue graphs,"Modgil, S.; Prakken, H.","An abstract framework for formalising persuasion dialogues has recently been proposed. The framework provides for a range of speech acts, and protocols of varying levels of flexibility. However, the framework assumes the availability of preference information relevant to determining whether arguments moved in a dialogue defeat each other. However, preference information may only become available after the dialogue has terminated. Hence, in this paper, we describe dialogues conducted under the assumption of an attack relation that does not account for preferences. We then describe how the resultant dialogue graph can be pruned by a preference relation in order to determine whether the winner of the dialogue is still the winner given the newly available preference information. We also describe a class of protocols that account for subsequent pruning by a preference relation, and show that under a restriction on the pruning, if the player defending the dialogue's main topic is winning the dialogue, then (s)he remains the winner irrespective of the preference relation applied. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

Changing personalities: Towards realistic virtual characters,"Poznanski, M.; Thagard, P.","Computer modelling of personality and behaviour is becoming increasingly important in many fields of computer science and psychology. Personality and emotion-driven Believable Agents are needed in areas like human-machine interfaces, electronic advertising and, most notably, electronic entertainment. Computer models of personality can help explain personality by illustrating its underlying structure and dynamics. This work presents a neural network model of personality and personality change. The goals are to help understand personality and create more realistic and believable characters for interactive video games. The model is based largely on trait theories of personality. Behaviour in the model results from the interaction of three components: (1) personality-based predispositions for behaviour, (2) moods/emotions and (3) environmental situations. Personality develops gradually over time depending on the situations encountered. Modelling personality change produces interesting and believable virtual characters whose behaviours change in psychologically plausible ways. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.",2005,,Journal of Experimental and Theoretical Artificial Intelligence,17,3,221-241,,10.1080/09528130500112478,,#6576,Poznanski 2005,,,0

We find that, among several interruption coordination strategies previously explored in the HCI literature, empathie interruptions are superior overall in gaining both short-term compliance and self-reported desire to continue working with the agent.

Computer-supported conflict resolution for collaborative facility designers,"Lara, M.A.; Nof, S.Y.","Fundamental in engineering design is the notion that collaboration is useful to reduce total project development time and increase design quality. A critical element of collaborative design is the resolution of conflict situations that result naturally from the interaction of cooperating designers, particularly when they are widely dispersed. A multi-approach method for computer-supported resolution of conflict situations in collaborative facility design is introduced. The method is based on social sciences theories used to solve human conflicts. FDL-CR, an extension of the Facility Description Language (FDL) with conflict resolution capabilities provided by the new tool, is the major development in this research. It provides fast identification of the conflict situation, diagnostics of conflict parameters, access to the conflict information by all conflicting parties and mechanisms for conflict resolution. The usefulness of FDL-CR is evaluated with a design case study where a neural-fuzzy inference system is developed to validate the conflict resolution method through the confrontation of conflicting parties. Computer-supported confrontation of conflicting parties was effective when other approaches, such as third-party mediation and persuasion, failed to provide conflict resolution. The new tool is viewed as an essential component of virtual design and manufacturing, and in general e-work.",2003,,International Journal of Production Research,41,2,207-233,,10.1080/0020754021000030411,,#6578,Lara 2003,,,0
Designing persuasive dialogue systems: Using argumentation with care,"Nguyen, H.; Masthoff, J.","Persuasive dialogue systems that aim to change people's attitudes and behaviours have drawn much attention in recent years due to their great practical potential. Current systems rely heavily on argumentation and advice-giving to form their persuasive messages. Many findings in psychology, and some counselling intervention methods such as Motivational Interviewing (MI) dispute this confrontational approach. Our project sets out to investigate whether MI can provide an alternative way to develop a more effective system. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of the argumentation-based approach, review a number of argumentation-based systems, and present the results of an evaluation study which compares people's perception of the persuasibility of two argumentation-based dialogues and a MI-based counterpart. Our results show a higher perceived persuasiveness for the MI-based dialogue. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2008,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),5033 LNCS,,201-212,,10.1007/978-3-540-68504-3_18,,#6579,Nguyen 2008,,,0
Agent Memory and Adaptation in Multi-Agent Systems,"Lerman, K.; Galstyan, A.","We describe a general mechanism for adaptation in multiagent systems in which agents modify their behavior based on their memory of past events. These behavior changes can be elicited by environmental dynamics or arise as response to the actions of other agents. The agents use memory to estimate the global state of the system from individual observations and adjust their actions accordingly. We also present a mathematical model of the dynamics of collective behavior in such systems and apply it to study adaptive coalition formation in electronic marketplaces. In adaptive coalition formation, the agents are more likely to join smaller coalitions than larger ones while there are many small coalitions. The rationale behind this is that smaller coalitions are necessary to nucleate larger ones. The agents remember the sizes of coalition they encountered and use them to estimate the mean coalition size. They decide whether to join a new coalition based on how close its size is to the mean coalition size. We show that the adaptive system displays most of the features of the non-adaptive one, but results in better long term system performance.",2003,,Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents,2,,797-803,,10.1145/860700.860703,,#6580,Lerman 2003,,,0
Backseat playgrounds: Pervasive storytelling in vast location based games,"Bichard, J.; Brunnberg, L.; Combetto, M.; Gustafsson, A.; Juhlin, O.","We have implemented a conceptual software framework and a story-based game that facilitates generation of rich and vivid narratives in vast geographical areas. An important design challenge in the emergent research area of pervasive gaming is to provide believable environments where game content is matched to the landscape in an evocative and persuasive way. More specificly, our game is designed to generate such an environment tailored to a journey as experienced from the backseat of a car. Therefore, it continuously references common geographical objects, such as houses, forests and churches, in the vicinity within the story; it provides a sequential narrative that fit with the drive; it works over vast areas, and it is possible to interact with the game while looking out of the windows. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.",2006,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),4161 LNCS,,117-122,,10.1007/11872320_14,,#6581,Bichard 2006,,,0
Prevarication in dispute protocols,"Dunne, P.E.","Models of persuasion, argument, and reasoning motivated by analogies from Law and legal process are now accepted formalisms supporting multi-agent discourse in applications such as contract negotiation and resolving disputed claims. A number of non-classical Logics and proof theories within these have been proposed specifically to deal with the special circumstances wherein propositional theories are not best suited to address modeling issues arising in legal contexts: e.g. exceptions and defaults are treated in a variety of so-called non-monotonic logics; similarly concepts of credulous, cautious and sceptical belief have been developed, partly to reflect differing forms of 'burden of proof' that may apply in various judicial contexts. Our concern in this paper is to consider one aspect of legal argument that appears to have been largely neglected in existing work concerning agent discourse protocols - particularly so in the arenas of persuasion and dispute resolution - the use of legitimate procedural devices to defer 'undesirable' conclusions being finalised and the deployment of such techniques in seeking to have a decision over-ruled. Motivating our study is the contention that individual agents within an 'agent society' could (be programmed to) act in a 'non-cooperative' manner: thus, contesting policies/decisions accepted by other agents in the 'society' in order to improve some national 'individual' utility. Using Dung's argumentation framework, we present various settings in which the use of 'legitimate delay' can be rigorously modeled, formulate some natural decision questions respecting the existence and utility of 'prevaricatory tactics', and, finally, illustrate within a greatly simplified schema, how carefully-chosen devices may greatly increase the length of an apparently 'straightforward' dispute.",2003,,Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law,,,Dec-21,,10.1145/1047788.1047791,,#6582,Dunne 2003,,,0
Artifices for persuading to improve eating habits,"Mazzotta, I.; De Rosis, F.","Eating habits are influenced by emotional factors. Persuasion to change wrong habits should therefore act on the central and the peripheral route at the same time, by combining rational and emotional strategies appropriately.

A behavior monitoring architecture for a mobile robot: Enhancing intelligence to behavior-based robotics,"Suksakulchai, S.; Wilkes, D.M.; Kawamura, K.","This paper presents a new behavior-based architecture for a mobile robot. The architecture coordinates behaviors based on a robot's internal condition and environment information. This approach combines the subsumption and schema-based approaches together with a unique feature called request or redundant mode. By monitoring a behavior's expected outcome, an unproductive behavior can request its redundant behavior to take over a task. On the other hand, when the requesting behavior can do the task again, it can take the task back. The results show that a system with the new architecture yields better performance than a system without it. Moreover, the new architecture can change behaviors' level and modes, add new behaviors, delete unused behaviors, and create new behaviors or tasks from existing behaviors at run-time, without reprogramming or restarting the entire system. © 2003 IEEE.",2003,,"Proceedings of IEEE International Symposium on Computational Intelligence in Robotics and Automation, CIRA",1,,157-162,,10.1109/CIRA.2003.1222081,,#6584,Suksakulchai 2003,,,0
PerCues: Trails of persuasion for ambient intelligence,"Tscheligi, M.; Reitberger, W.; Obermair, C.; Ploderer, B.",The realization of the ambient intelligence (AmI) vision will have a profound impact on our everyday lives and society. AmI applied in contexts like homes or public spaces will not only affect individual users but influence entire groups of users. The question is how we can apply such technologies to persuade groups and individual users. Our approach is to design AmI environments by borrowing a concept which works very well in biological and social systems: Collective Intelligence (CI). The intelligence of a group surpasses the individual intelligences and leads to improved problem solving capabilities of individuals and groups. From nature we borrow examples of cues in the environment to stimulate goal directed collective intelligence (perCues). The application of perCues in AmI environments helps to persuade users to reach a common goal like decreasing environmental pollution. Adopting CI for AmI we blaze a trail for the design of persuasive AmI environments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.,2006,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),3962 LNCS,,203-206,,10.1007/11755494_31,,#6585,Tscheligi 2006,,,0
Persuasion in practical argument using value-based argumentation frameworks,"Bench-Capon, T.J.M.","In many cases of disagreement, particularly in situations involving practical reasoning, it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that either party is wrong. The role of argument in such cases is to persuade rather than to prove, demonstrate or refute. Following Perelman, we argue that persuasion in such cases relies on a recognition that the strength of an argument depends on the social values that it advances, and that whether the attack of one argument on another succeeds depends on the comparative strength of the values advanced by the arguments concerned. To model this we extend the standard notion of Argumentation Frameworks (AFs)to Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAFs). After defining VAFs we explore their properties, and show how they can provide a rational basis for the acceptance or rejection of arguments, even where this would appear to be a matter of choice in a standard AF. In particular we show that in a VAF certain arguments can be shown to be acceptable however the relative strengths of the values involved are assessed. This means that disputants can concur on the acceptance of arguments, even when they differ as to which values are more important, and hence that we can identify points for which persuasion should be possible. We illustrate the above using an example moral debate. We then show how factual considerations can be admitted to our framework and discuss the possibility of persuasion in the face of uncertainty and disagreement as to values.",2003,,Journal of Logic and Computation,13,3,429-448,,10.1093/logcom/13.3.429,,#6586,Bench-Capon 2003,,,0
Theory based explanation of case law domains,"Bench-Capon, T.; Sartor, G.","In this paper we put forward a formal description of theories which can be used to record understanding of, and explain decisions in, case law domains. We believe that reasoning with cases involves all of theory construction, use and evaluation, and that awareness of the theory which provides a context for case based arguments is essential to understanding such arguments. Moreover, our account of these theories includes a systematic link between factors and values, which we believe is necessary to explain why some arguments prove to be more persuasive than others. We begin by formalising the various elements that the theories contain, and then provide a set of theory constructors which allow theories to built up from the background of decided cases. We show how such theories can be used to explain decisions on particular cases. We discuss how theories can be compared and evaluated. We then show how the argument moves of HYPO and CATO can be understood in terms of our framework. We conclude with a brief discussion of an implementation of the framework, and a summary of the major features of our approach.

Social dynamics in web page through inter-agent interaction,"Takeuchi, Y.; Katagiri, Y.","Social persuasion abounds in human-human interactions. Attitudes and behaviors of people are invariably influenced by the attitudes and behaviors of other people as well as our social roles/relationships toward them. In the pedagogic scene, the relationship between teacher and learner produces one of the most typical interactions, in which the teacher makes the learner spontaneously study what he/she teaches. This study is an attempt to elucidate the nature and effectiveness of social persuasion in human-computer interaction environments. We focus on the social dynamics of multi-party interactions that involve both human-agent and inter-agent interactions. An experiment is conducted in a virtual web-instruction setting employing two types of agents: conductor agents who accompany and guide each learner throughout his/her learning sessions, and domain-expert agents who provide explanations and instructions for each stage of the instructional materials. In this experiment, subjects are assigned two experimental conditions: the authorized condition, in which an agent respectfully interacts with another agent, and the non-authorized condition, in which an agent carelessly interacts with another agent. The results indicate performance improvements in the authorized condition of inter-agent interactions. An analysis is given from the perspective of the transfer of authority from inter-agent to human-agent interactions based on social conformity. We argue for pedagogic advantages of social dynamics created by multiple animated character agents.",2002,,Transactions of the Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence,17,4,439-448,,10.1527/tjsai.17.439,,#6589,Takeuchi 2002,,,0
Establishing the computer-patient working alliance in automated health behavior change interventions,"Bickmore, T.; Gruber, A.; Picard, R.","Current user interfaces for automated patient and consumer health care systems can be improved by leveraging the results of several decades of research into effective patient-provider communication skills.

Results of a comparison among 33 subjects interacting near-daily with the relational system and 27 interacting near-daily with an identical system with the relational behaviors ablated, each for 30 days indicate, that the use of relational behaviors by the system significantly increases working alliance and desire to continue working with the system. Comparison of the above groups to another group of 31 subjects interacting with a control system near-daily for 30 days also indicated a significant increase in proactive viewing of health information. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Exploring hierarchical user feedback in email clustering,"Huang, Y.; Mitchell, T.M.","Organizing data into hierarchies is natural for humans. However, there is little work in machine learning that explores human-machine mixed-initiative approaches to organizing data into hierarchical clusters. In this paper we consider mixed-initiative clustering of a user's email, in which the machine produces (initial and re-trained) hierarchical clusterings of email, and the user iteratively reviews and edits the hierarchical clustering, providing constraints on the next iteration of clustering. Key challenges include (a) determining types of feedback that users will find natural to provide, (b) developing hierarchical clustering and retraining algorithms capable of accepting these types of user feedback, (c) determining the correspondence between two hierarchical structures, and (d) understanding how user behavior changes during a single feedback session and designing machine strategies that change with the user. Preliminary experimental results of two cases shows that under ideal conditions, this mixed-initiative approach requires only 6 minutes of user effort to achieve email clusterings comparable to those requiring 13 to 15 minutes of manual editing efforts.

Analogy in scientific argumentation,"Gibson, K.","Analogical reasoning has long been an important tool in the production of scientific knowledge, yet many scientists remain hesitant to fully endorse (or even admit) its use. As the teachers of scientific and technical writers, we have an opportunity and responsibility to teach them to use analogy without their writing becoming “overly inductive,” as Aristotle warned. To that end, I here offer an analysis of an example of the effective use of analogy in Rodney Brooks's “Intelligence Without Representation.” In this article, Brooks provides a model for incorporating these tools into an argument by building four of them into an enthymeme that clearly organizes his argument. This combination of inductive and deductive reasoning helped the article become a very influential piece of scholarship in artificial intelligence research, and it can help our students learn to use analogy in their own writing. Every one who effects persuasion through proof does in fact use either enthymemes or examples: there is no other way.

The turing test: The first 50 years,"French, R.M.","The Turing Test, originally proposed as a simple operational definition of intelligence, has now been with us for exactly half a century. It is safe to say that no other single article in computer science, and few other articles in science in general, have generated so much discussion. The present article chronicles the comments and controversy surrounding Turing's classic article from its publication to the present. The changing perception of the Turing Test over the last 50 years has paralleled the changing attitudes in the scientific community towards artificial intelligence: from the unbridled optimism of 1960s to the current realization of the immense difficulties that still lie ahead. I conclude with the prediction that the Turing Test will remain important, not only as a landmark in the history of the development of intelligent machines, but also with real relevance to future generations of people living in a world in which the cognitive capacities of machines will be vastly greater than they are now. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.",2000,,Trends in Cognitive Sciences,4,3,115-122,,10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01453-4,,#6604,French 2000,,,0

The system uses physical proximity between mobile devices to help users filter incoming information and determine its relevance. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2002.",2002,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),2411,,60-68,,10.1007/3-540-45756-9_6,,#6609,Huang 2002,,,0
Artificial agents and the art of persuasion,"Rudman, P.; Zajicek, M.","We present the results of an experiment in support of our position that communication between Humans and Artificial Agents will only succeed when agents follow the unwritten rules of human social interaction. We have examined two situations of simulated human-agent interaction, where the agent interrupts with sensible but unsolicited suggestions. Our examination of the humans' reactions show the importance of not criticising people's existing view of a situation, but rather offering information to persuade them to change their view voluntarily. © 2006 IEEE.",2006,,Proceedings - 2006 IEEE/WIC/ACM International Conference on Web Intelligence and Intelligent Agent Technology (WI-IAT 2006 Workshops Proceedings),,,363-366,,10.1109/WI-IATW.2006.47,,#6610,Rudman 2006,,,0
New academic fields as social movements: The case of strategic management,"Hambrick, D.C.; Chen, M.-J.","Scholars in the sociology of science have long been interested in the factors that cause an established academic field to be prestigious, as well as in the benefits that accrue from having prestige. But they have shown remarkably little interest in systematic investigation of the factors that allow an academic field to emerge at all. In this paper, we model the ascendance of a new academic field as a successful social movement, consisting of three major elements: differentiation, mobilization, and legitimacy-building. For a new field to emerge, the aspiring community must differentiate itself from other existing fields, making claims about how a class of important problems cannot be solved by these status quo entities. Second, there must be a mobilization of resources; the elements of collective action - political opportunity structure, a bounded set of shared interests, and social infrastructure - must be in place or put in place. Third, the aspiring community must build legitimacy in the eyes of the academic establishment, both by intellectual persuasion as well as by adherence to the norms, styles, and standards of adjacent established fields. We illustrate each element of our model by applying it to the published histories of four academic fields: agricultural chemistry, artificial intelligence, molecular biology, and radio astronomy. And we apply the model comprehensively to explain the rise of a specific field within the administrative sciences: strategic management.",2005,,Academy of Management Annual Meeting Proceedings,,,,,,,#6611,Hambrick 2005,,,0
Using conversation policies to solve problems of ambiguity in argumentation and artificial intelligence,"Walton, D.","This investigation joins recent research on problems with ambiguity in two fields, argumentation and computing. In argumentation, there is a concern with fallacies arising from ambiguity, including equivocation and amphiboly. In computing, the development of agent communication languages is based on conversation policies that make it possible to have information exchanges on the internet, as well as other forms of dialogue like persuasion and negotiation, in which ambiguity is a problem. Because it is not possible to sharply differentiate between problems arising from ambiguity and those arising from vagueness, obscurity and indeterminacy, some study of the latter is included. The semantic web is based on what are called ontologies, or systems of classification of concepts, shown to be useful tools for dealing with these problems. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.",2006,,Pragmatics and Cognition,14,1,Mar-36,,10.1075/pc.14.1.03wal,,#6612,Walton 2006,,,0
Persuasive argumentation in human computer dialogue,"Andrews, P.; De Boni, M.; Manandhar, S.","In the field of natural language dialogue, a new trend is exploring persuasive argumentation theories. Applying these theories to human-computer dialogue management could lead to a more comfortable experience for the user and give way to new applications. In this paper, we study the different aspects of persuasive communication needed for health-care advising and how to implement them to produce efficient, computer directed persuasion. Our opinion is that a persuasive dialogue will have to combine the current logical approach to persuasion with novel emotional cues to render the dialogue more comfortable to the user.

Digital chameleons: Automatic assimilation of nonverbal gestures in immersive virtual environments,"Bailenson, J.N.; Yee, N.","Previous research demonstrated social influence resulting from mimicry (the chameleon effect); a confederate who mimicked participants was more highly regarded than a confederate who did not, despite the fact that participants did not explicitly notice the mimicry. In the current study, participants interacted with an embodied artificial intelligence agent in immersive virtual reality. The agent either mimicked a participant's head movements at a 4-s delay or utilized prerecorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Mimicking agents were more persuasive and received more positive trait ratings than nonmimickers, despite participants' inability to explicitly detect the mimicry. These data are uniquely powerful because they demonstrate the ability to use automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) to gain social influence. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate social influence effects with a nonhuman, nonverbal mimicker.

Aptitude-treatment interactions in preservice teachers' behavior change during computer-simulated teaching,"Yeh, Y.-C.","Adapting training methods to specific teacher traits to best facilitate the training effects for preservice teachers is an important, yet neglected, topic in aptitude-treatment interaction research. This study investigated interactions between four personal traits (CT-dispositions, thinking styles, CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence) and two designed treatments on preservice teachers' behavior change during a computer-simulated teaching experience. One hundred and seventy-eight preservice teachers participated in this study. The CS-TGCTS simulation program was employed to measure the preservice teachers' actual use of effective teacher behaviors, as well as the four targeted personal traits which were measured by three Likert-scale inventories and one multiple-choice test. The results suggest that preservice teachers with high levels of CT-dispositions, CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence - as well as those with judicial or legislative thinking styles - are mindful, analytical, and reflective in their teaching practices and therefore more likely to continually improve their teaching skills. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Measures for persuasion dialogs: A preliminary investigation,"Amgoud, L.; De Saint Cyr, F.D.","Persuasion is one of the main types of dialogs encountered in everyday life. The basic idea behind a persuasion is that two (or more) agents disagree on a state of affairs, and each one tries to persuade the other to change his mind. For that purpose, agents exchange arguments of different strengths. Several systems, grounded on argumentation theory, have been proposed in the literature for modeling persuasion dialogs. These systems have studied more or less deeply the different protocols required for this kind of dialogs, and have investigated different termination criteria. However, nothing is said about the properties of the generated dialogs, nor on the behavior of the interacting agents. Besides, analyzing dialogs is a usual task in everyday life. For instance, political debates are generally deeply dissected. In this paper we define measures for analyzing dialogs from the point of view of an external agent. In particular, three kinds of measures are proposed: i) measures of the quality of the exchanged arguments in terms of their strengths, ii) measures of the behavior of each participating agent in terms of its coherence, its aggressiveness in the dialog, and finally in terms of the novelty of its arguments, iii) measures of the quality of the dialog itself in terms of the relevance and usefulness of its moves. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

Dialogues about the burden of proof,"Prakken, H.; Reed, C.; Walton, D.","This paper analyses the phenomenon of a shift of the burden of proof in legal persuasion dialogues. Some sample dialogues are analysed of types of situations where such a shift may occur, viz. reasoning with defeasible rules, reasoning with argumentation schemes and reasoning with mere presumptions. It is argued that whether a shift in the burden of proof occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion dialogues about the burden of proof. It is also shown that dialogues about the burden of proof are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument.

Genetic algorithm for fuel spill identification,"Lavine, B.K.; Brzozowski, D.; Moores, A.J.; Davidson, C.E.; Mayfield, H.T.","Gas chromatography is frequently used to fingerprint fuel spills, with the gas chromatograms of the spill sample and the different candidate fuels compared visually in order to seek a best match. However, visual analysis of gas chromatograms is subjective and is not always persuasive in a court of law. Pattern recognition methods offer a better approach to the problem of matching gas chromatograms of weathered fuels. Pattern recognition methods involve less subjectivity in the interpretation of the data and are capable of identifying fingerprint patterns within gas chromatographic (GC) data characteristic of fuel-type, even if the fuel samples comprising the training set have been subjected to a variety of conditions. In this paper, we report on the development of a genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern recognition analysis of GC fuel spill data. The pattern recognition GA incorporates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a ""smart"" one-pass procedure for feature selection. Its efficacy is demonstrated by way of two studies recently completed in our laboratory on fuel spill identification. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.",2001,,Analytica Chimica Acta,437,2,233-246,,10.1016/S0003-2670(01)00946-1,,#6619,Lavine 2001,,,0

Optimal Utterances in Dialogue Protocols,"Dunne, P.E.; McBurney, P.","Dialogue protocols have been the subject of considerable attention with respect to their potential applications in multiagent system environments. Formalisations of such protocols define classes of dialogue locutions, concepts of a dialogue state, and rules under which a dialogue proceeds. One important consideration in implementing a protocol concerns the criteria an agent should apply in choosing which utterance will constitute its next contribution to a discussion in progress: ideally, an agent should select a locution that (by some measure) ""optimises"" the outcome. The precise interpretation of 'optimise' is, however, something that may vary greatly depending on the nature and intent of a dialogue area. If we consider 'persuasion' protocols, where one agent's intention is to convince others of the validity or invalidity of a specific proposition, then optimality might be regarded in the sense of ""choice of locution that results in a 'minimal length' debate"": thus the agent defending a hypothesis tries to select utterances that will convince other participants of the validity of this hypothesis after 'as few locutions as possible'. We present a formal setting for considering the problem of deciding if a particular utterance in the context of a persuasion dialogue is optimal in this sense. We show that, in general, this decision problem is both NP-hard and CO-NP-hard.",2003,,Proceedings of the International Conference on Autonomous Agents,2,,608-615,,10.1145/860672.860673,,#6622,Dunne 2003,,,0

Using the wizard of Oz method to train persuasive agents,"Kawasoe, M.; Narita, T.; Kitamura, Y.","Persuasive conversational agents persuade users to change their attitudes or behaviors through conversation and are expected to be applied as virtual sales-clerks in e-shopping sites. Developing such an agent requires a conversation model that identifies the most appropriate responses to the user's inputs. To create such a model, we propose the approach of combining a learning agent with the Wizard of Oz method; in this approach, a person (called the Wizard) talks to the user pretending to be the agent. The agent learns from the conversations between the Wizard and the user and constructs its own conversation model. In this approach, the Wizard has to reply to most of the user's inputs at the beginning, but the burden gradually falls because the agent learns how to reply as the conversation model grows. Every persuasive conversation has the goal of persuading the user and ends with success or failure. We introduce a goal-oriented conversation model that can represent the success probability of persuasion and a learning method to update the model depending on the success/failure of the persuasive conversation. We introduce a learning persuasive agent that implements the conversation model and the learning method and evaluate it in the situation wherein the agent persuades users to choose one type of digital camera over another. The agent could succeed in reducing the Wizard's inputs by 48%, and, more interestingly, succeeded in persuading 2 users without any help from the Wizard. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2008,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),5180 LNAI,,177-190,,10.1007/978-3-540-85834-8_15,,#6624,Kawasoe 2008,,,0
Movie magic in the clinic: computer-generated characters for automated health counseling.,"Bickmore, T.","In this presentation, I demonstrate how many of the technologies used in movie special effects and games have been successfully used in health education and behavior change interventions. Computer-animated health counselors simulate human face-to-face dialogue as a computer interface medium, including not only verbal behavior but nonverbal conversational behavior such as hand gesture, body posture shifts, and facial display of emotion. This technology has now been successfully used in a wide range of health interventions for education and counseling of patients and consumers, including applications in physical activity promotion, medication adherence, and hospital discharge. These automated counselors have been deployed on home computers, hospital-based touch screen kiosks, and mobile devices with integrated health behavior sensing capability. Development of these agents is an interdisciplinary endeavor spanning the fields of character modeling and animation, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, health communication and behavioral medicine.

"Knowledge representation, A.I applications and data-mining","Khorsi, A.","In spite of differences in the Artificial intelligence definitions, those definitions agree with the fact that the A.I aim is to transfer the intelligent human behavior to the computer. This do necessary the modeling of the intelligent human behavior. However, the modeling task is not at all evident. When the considered application is related to the human intuition (i.e knowledge acquisition and use), the modeling process move away from formal, and depends mainly on the expert perception of the human comportment. Note that the expert perception might be incomplete, and depends on research results on each domain related to the human cognition. In spite of that, many implemented models gave satisfactory results. Most persuasive example are neural networks. In this paper, we will present a simple model oriented to knowledge acquiring and use; we mean by use, the task commonly called ""inference"". We based our model on some human cognition behaviors observed through some experimentations. The main remarkable qualities of our model are the high level of abstraction, the flexibility to addition, suppression and substitution, the graphical simple representation, and the tolerance to errors which can occur during knowledge acquisition. We have already implemented the model in various applications.

A comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning,"Buşoniu, L.; Babuška, R.; De Schutter, B.","Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided. © 2008 IEEE.",2008,,"IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man and Cybernetics Part C: Applications and Reviews",38,2,156-172,,10.1109/TSMCC.2007.913919,,#6628,Buşoniu 2008,,,0
Introduction to Part 1,"Mayes, T.","The most enduring learning experiences are those that change attitudes. When I was invited to write an introduction to this part of the book I hesitated for a moment. Let me explain why. While long advocating the reuse of learning dialogues as a learning resource, I have nevertheless thought of myself as a sceptic on the topic of learning objects. My attitude had been rooted in the belief that it is fundamentally misguided to think of learning as having anything much to do with content. As a good constructivist I knew that many had been tempted away from the path of true pedagogy by the seductive vision of automated instruction. For many years the discipline of artificial intelligence offered the prospect of computer-generated courses, with the software capable of understanding enough about both the subject matter and the individual learner to be able to conduct an automated tutorial. Subject matter would be automatically selected from a knowledge base and offered to the learner in a way that filled in the identified gaps in the learner’s knowledge. It had seemed to me that the idea of learning objects that could be automatically combined into a course, tailored for an individual learner, was a re-emergence of that flawed vision. Admittedly the idea was more modest in its goals than that of building full-blown intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). © Allison Littlejohn and the individual contributors, 2004.",2003,,Reusing Online Resources: A Sustainable Approach to E-learning,,,09-Nov,,10.4324/9780203465677-9,,#6630,Mayes 2003,,,0

The control system thus obtained is hierarchically organized, with a standard reprogrammable controller under the direction of a rule-based system.",1988,,Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,,,575-579,,,,#6631,Taylor 1988,,,0

Control of parallel population dynamics by social-like behavior of GA-individuals,"Mattfeld, D.C.; Kopfer, H.; Bierwirth, C.",A frequently observed difficulty in the application of genetic algorithms to the domain of optimization arises from premature convergence. In order to preserve genotype diversity we develop a new model of auto-adaptive behavior for individuals. In this model a population member is an active individual that assumes social-like behavior patterns. Different individuals living in the same population can assume different patterns. By moving in a hierarchy of “social states” individuals change their behavior. Changes of social state are controlled by arguments of plausibility. These arguments are implemented as a rule set for a massively-parallel genetic algorithm. Computational experiments on 12 large-scale job shop benchmark problems show that the results of the new approach dominate the ordinary genetic algorithm significantly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1994.,1994,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),866 LNCS,,16-25,,10.1007/3-540-58484-6_246,,#6634,Mattfeld 1994,,,0
On a Japanese-style organizations simulated by personalistic agents,"Okada, Isamu; Ishida, Kazunari; Ohta, Toshizumi","This paper proposes that a Japanese-style organization may be well understood when we focus on the personality of its members. This observation is derived from our simulation based on a personalistic agent model. Our computer simulations are designed to explore the organizational behavior related to organizational rigidity and an organization's reorganizing processes based on a personality model of organizational members. We define the individual personality of members in our model based on Karson and O'Dell's psychological theory. The personality of members has three parameters in our model: task stickiness, interpersonal emotion, and conservativeness. The rigidity of the organization perceived by agents is formulated in our model as the organization's performance, its adaptability to the environment, and incredibility for information. We formulate the reorganization based on attitude change theory and the Minsky's difference engine model. Our simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning Japanese-style organizations. First, the cliques brought by the interpersonal emotion of agents may be considered to generate the peculiar communication style similar to that of Japanese-style organizations such as Keiretsu. Second, the task stickiness and the attitude change of agents develop the specialization-structuralization chain. The chain can be considered to give Japanese-style organizations an advantage over U.S. or European organizations in adapting to different environments.",1999,,"Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics",5,,V-132,,,,#6635,Okada 1999,,,0
"Copyright protection for computer programs, databases, and computer-generated works: Is anything new since CONTU?","Miller, A.R.","In 1976, Congress created the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to examine the implications of computer and other information technologies and to advise Congress on whether it would be wise to assimilate these new technologies into the existing copyright regime. Ever since, a number of people have voiced criticisms of CONTU's recommendations, arguing for a modification of the current copyright regime or even a different legal structure for these issues. Although these critics have many different approaches, they share the fear that incorporating these technologies into the current copyright system will lead to overprotection. In this Article, Professor Miller examines these arguments and concludes that CONTU's recommendations were correct and that the current regime is flexible enough to address the critics' concerns. First, Professor Miller surveys the progress of the court decisions involving computer programs, and demonstrates that a set of coherent copyright principles is beginning to develop in this area. Next, Professor Miller discusses the newer phenomenon of artificial intelligence, and utilizes copyright principles that have developed in the areas of computer programs and databases to demonstrate that at its current stage of development, artificial intelligence does not pose any significant obstacles to copyright analysis. Finally, Professor Miller addresses the claim that it eventually will be impossible to assimilate computer-generated works into the copyright system because they may have no obvious human author, and concludes not only that the caselaw contains no persuasive objection to extending copyright protection to these works, but also that such an extension would fulfill the constitutional imperative of promoting progress in these areas.",1993,,Harvard Law Review,106,5,978-1073,,10.2307/1341682,,#6636,Miller 1993,,,0
Computational and mathematical organization theory: Perspective and directions,"Carley, K.M.","Computational and mathematical organization theory is an interdisciplinary scientific area whose research members focus on developing and testing organizational theory using formal models. The community shares a theoretical view of organizations as collections of processes and intelligent adaptive agents that are task oriented, socially situated, technologically bound, and continuously changing. Behavior within the organization is seen to affect and be affected by the organization's, position in the external environment. The community also shares a methodological orientation toward the use of formal models for developing and testing theory. These models are both computational (e.g., simulation, emulation, expert systems, computer-assisted numerical analysis) and mathematical (e.g., formal logic, matrix algebra, network analysis, discrete and continuous equations). Much of the research in this area falls into four areas: organizational design, organizational learning, organizations and information technology, and organizational evolution and change. Historically, much of the work in this area has been focused on the issue how should organizations be designed. The work in this subarea is cumulative and tied to other subfields within organization theory more generally. The second most developed area is organizational learning. This research, however, is more tied to the work in psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence than to general organization theory. Currently there is increased activity in the subareas of organizations and information technology and organizational evolution and change. Advances in these areas may be made possible by combining network analysis techniques with an information processing approach to organizations. Formal approaches are particularly valuable to all of these areas given the complex adaptive nature of the organizational agents and the complex dynamic nature of the environment faced by these agents and the organizations. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",1995,,Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory,1,1,39-56,,10.1007/BF01307827,,#6637,Carley 1995,,,0
Managing change in persistent object systems,"Atkinson, M.P.; Sjøberg, D.I.K.; Morrison, R.",Persistent object systems are highly-valued technology because they offer an effective foundation for building very long-lived persistent application systems (PAS). The technology becomes more effective as it offers a more consistently integrated computational context. For it to be feasible to design and construct a PAS it must be possible to incrementally add program and data to the existing collection. For a PAS to endure it must offer flexibility: a capacity to evolve and change. This paper examines the capacity of persistent object systems to accommodate incremental construction and change. Established store based technologies can support incremental construction but methodologies are needed to deploy them effectively. Evolving data description is one motivation for inheritance but inheritance alone is not enough to support change management. The case for supporting incremental change is very persuasive. The challenge is to provide technologies that will facilitate it and methodologies that will organise it. This paper identifies change absorbers as a means of describing how changes should propagate. It is argued that if we systematically develop an adequate repertoire of change absorbers then they will facilitate much better quality change management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1993.,1993,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),742 LNCS,,315-338,,10.1007/3-540-57342-9_81,,#6638,Atkinson 1993,,,0
Toward a computational theory of arguing with precedents: Accomodating multiple interpretations of cases,"Ashley, K.D.","This paper presents a partial theory of arguing with precedents in law and illustrates how that theory supports multiple interpretations of a precedent. The theory provides succinct computational definitions of (1) the most persuasive precedents to cite in the principal argument roles and (2) the most salient aspects of the precedents to emphasize when citing them in those roles. Ati extended example, drawn from the output of the HYPO program, illustrates the range of différent descriptions of the same precedent that are supported by the theory. Each description focuses on different salient aspects of the case depending on the argument context. © ACM.",1989,,Proceedings of the International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Law,Part F130177,,93-102,,10.1145/74014.74028,,#6639,Ashley 1989,,,0
Changing attitudes,"Bell, J.","This paper brings together ideas from work on commonsense causal reasoning and work on formalising attitudes, such as beliefs, desires, intentions and obligations, to provide the basis of a theory of changing attitudes. It takes the view that rational agents do not change their attitudes without reason, and aims to represent such changes in teleological theories. The infrastructure of these theories contain persistence rules which state that agents attitudes persist unless they have reason to change them. Theories giving the agents’ reasons for changing their attitudes build on these. This leads to a discussion of rationality in resource-bounded agents and the paper concludes by outlining an AI-planning theory of rational agency. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1995.",1995,,Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics),890,,40-55,,10.1007/3-540-58855-8_2,,#6640,Bell 1995,,,0
A learning reactive scheduler using CBR/L,"Szelke, E.; Márkus, G.","Machine learning techniques can increase the power/expertise and improve the problem-solving efficiency of artificial intelligence applications for complex problems such as reactive scheduling in manufacturing operations management. Reactivity requires adaptively changing behaviour of a performance system that can best be supported by learning from experience. Reactive scheduling is considered in this paper with two options for reactive repair/proactive schedule adjustment to compensate for/prevent the effects of disturbances during the execution time of a current schedule. With a supervisory control perspective to shop floor operations, reactive scheduling of the two options above is embodied as one major intelligent supervisory function in a supervisory reactive scheduler SUPREACT and complemented by a cognitive learning approach to improve search space/control pattern-matching knowledge for guiding iterative schedule repair actions. In a brief overview, some learning approaches that comprise past experience for future re-use in reactive scheduling are referred to. The paper then presents a combined rule- and case-based reasoning/learning approach to opportunistic reactive scheduling based on a blackboard framework of the system's Expert Supervisor Unit, which also supports human integration into supervisory control of executed processes. Inherent learning ability of the case-based component allows to capture new schedule repair/search control knowledge, including also human preferences, and thus improve the system's reactive/pro-active schedule repair efficiency in response to unexpected events/performance deterioration trends during the execution of predictive schedules in manufacturing shop floors. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",1997,,Computers in Industry,33,1,31-46,,10.1016/s0166-3615(97)00009-2,,#6641,Szelke 1997,,,0
"Commitments in the architecture of a limited, rational agent","Singh, M.P.","Rationality is a useful metaphor for understanding autonomous, intelligent agents. A persuasive view of intelligent agents uses cognitive primitives such as intentions and beliefs to describe, explain, and specify their behavior. These primitives are often associated with a notion of commitment that is internal to the given agent. However, at first sight, there is a tension between commitments and rationality. We show how the two concepts can be reconciled for the important and interesting case of limited, intelligent agents. We show how our approach extends to handle more subtle issues such as precommitments, which have previously been assumed to be conceptually too complex. We close with a proposal to develop conative policies as a means to represent commitments in a generic, declarative manner. © 1997, Springer-Verlag.

Content ordering in the generation of persuasive discourse,"Reed, C.; Long, D.","A framework is summarized which supports the planning of natural language argument structure. One key aspect of natural argument is the order in which components are presented. This is in part responsible for both the coherency and persuasive effect of an argument. One means of effecting such ordering is proposed, and an overview is provided of the various classes of ordering heuristics. These heuristics are based upon insights offered by rhetoric texts, psychological research, and a corpus study. Finally, it is demonstrated that such an approach can also contribute to the generation of surface textual features including formatting, punctuation and clue words.",1997,,IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence,2,,1022-1027,,,,#6643,Reed 1997,,,0
Information model of systemic organization of human mental functions: new approach to the problem of artificial intelligence,"Umriukhin, E.A.","The information model of systemic functions of the human brain reproduces important features of human intelligence: goal planning, prediction of needed results, behavior correction by feedback from the parameters of the results obtained and their comparison with the acceptor of action results. Human behavior imitation in the model is statistically proved by testing the model on a computer. An Adaptron apparatus based on the model quantitatively estimates the parameters of an important mechanism of the brain, namely human intuitive learning. With the Adaptron, the ade-dependent properties and some human intellectual dysfunctions are estimated, which reflect the mechanisms of prediction of future results, the building of memory traces in intuitive learning when the findings coincide with the planned results and the restructure of memory and respective behavior changes when the findings do not coincide with the planned ones.",1997,,Vestnik Rossiiskoi akademii meditsinskikh nauk / Rossiiskaia akademiia meditsinskikh nauk,,12,19-26,,,,#6644,Umriukhin 1997,,,0
Artificial bootstrap,"Das, Asesh","The author investigates the migration of a process from the symbol level to the knowledge level based on one such study done on an atomic reactor. In engineering there are self-emerging processes grouped under the common term boostrap. The nature of such bootstraps is examined in providing explanations for exotic new states in the reactor. Knowledge engineers formulate the performance of the reactor on a problem space, where they are forced to postulate the existence of a special function, called the delta function, to explain the occurrences of bootstraps. At the symbol level, the existence of bootstrap operation triggered by a delta function is seen to have its origin from the basic non-monotonic behavior of the system. At the knowledge level, it is argued that a bootstrap or its persuasive explanation comes from the knowledge engineer who is the architect of the system, both at the symbol and knowledge level. It is argued that knowledge engineers should be able to design metarules to control and explain bootstraps.",1992,,Conference Proceedings - IEEE SOUTHEASTCON,1,,255-261,,,,#6645,Das 1992,,,0
Modelling the negotiation paradigm for the banking industry,"Sadananda, R.; Acharya, S.K.",Researchers in economics- and business-related industries have shown interest in negotiation paradigms involving interacting agents. Many researchers in artificial intelligence are looking at the possibility of modelling negotiation. It has been viewed as a traversal in a large search space of solutions with the objective of satisfying what appeared in the beginning antagonistic interests. In this paper we briefly review some of the relevant work in the area of negotiation. We discuss a model for the lending process of a banking industry and its implementation. We make some concluding remarks mostly based on this experience. © 1993.,1993,,Computers in Industry,22,3,263-272,,10.1016/0166-3615(93)90093-G,,#6646,Sadananda 1993,,,0
Persuasive argumentation in negotiation,"Sycara, K.P.","This paper presents Persuasive Argumentation as a means of guiding the negotiation process to a settlement. Decision theoretic approaches construct prescriptive models of the negotiation process that make various assumptions about the behavior of the negotiation participants but do not model changes in behavior. On the other hand, models for decision support leave the actual decisions to human negotiators, again not modeling or automating the negotiating process. In contrast to both approaches, our work deals with automating the negotiation process. This paper focuses on modeling the process by which the beliefs and behavior of negotiators are changed via persuasive argumentation. We claim that persuasive argumentation lies at the heart of negotiation and embodies the dynamics of negotiation. We present a model of persuasive argumentation that integrates Artificial Intelligence and decision theoretic methods.

Searle's Chinese box: Debunking the Chinese room argument,"Hauser, L.","John Searle's Chinese room argument is perhaps the most influential and widely cited argument against artificial intelligence (AI). Understood as targeting AI proper - claims that computers can think or do think - Searle's argument, despite its rhetorical flash, is logically and scientifically a dud. Advertised as effective against AI proper, the argument, in its main outlines, is an ignoratio elenchi. It musters persuasive force fallaciously by indirection fostered by equivocal deployment of the phrase ""strong AI"" and reinforced by equivocation on the phrase ""causal powers' (at least) equal to those of brains."" On a more carefully crafted understanding - understood just to target metaphysical identification of thought with computation (""Functionalism"" or ""Computationalism"") and not AI proper the argument is still unsound, though more interestingly so. It's unsound in ways difficult for high church - ""someday my prince of an AI program will come"" - believers in AI to acknowledge without undermining their high church beliefs. The ad hominem bite of Searle's argument against the high church persuasions of so many cognitive scientists, I suggest, largely explains the undeserved repute this really quite disreputable argument enjoys among them. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",1997,,Minds and Machines,7,2,199-226,,10.1023/A:1008255830248,,#6648,Hauser 1997,,,0

Towards a qualitative Langrangian theory of fluid flow,"Skorstad, Gordon","Choosing between multiple ontological perspectives is crucial for reasoning about the physical world. Choosing the wrong perspective can make a reasoning task impossible. This paper introduces a Lagrangian plug flow ontology (PF) for reasoning about thermodynamic fluid flow. We show that this ontology captures continuously changing behaviors of flowing fluids not represented in currently implemented ontologies. These behaviors are essential for understanding thermodynamic applications such as power cycles, refrigeration, liquefaction, throttling and flow through nozzles. We express the ontology within the framework of Qualitative Process (QP) theory. To derive our QP theory for plug flow, we use the method of causal clustering to find causal interpretations of thermodynamic equations. We also incorporate qualitative versions of standard thermodynamic relations, including the second law of thermodynamics and Clapeyron's equation.",1992,,Proceedings Tenth National Conference on Artificial Intelligence,,,691-696,,,,#6650,Skorstad 1992,,,0
Failure modes and effects analysis of complex engineering systems using functional models,"Hawkins, P.G.; Woollons, D.J.",A set of models developed by Chittaro for fault diagnosis is extended to represent more complex engineering systems. A novel methodology for qualitative reasoning about behaviour change has been developed for the purpose of failure modes and effects analysis to cope with complete and partial failure modes. The method is demonstrated on an electrically driven gear pump. A further extension is the ability to cope with control systems by distinguishing the function of two closed loop control schemes. Different types of failure of the control scheme can be identified by analysing three different responses of the faulty plant. This method is demonstrated on a manufactured aerospace component called a fuel-metering unit controlled by a negative feedback control scheme. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

Using argumentation in text generation,"Elhadad, M.","Text generation is a field of artificial intelligence aiming at producing computer models of natural language production. This paper discusses the use of the theory of 'Argumentation in Language' in the field of Text Generation. Most text generators follow the same sequence of steps to produce a coherent paragraph: content determination - selecting of information to include in the text from an underlying computer database; content organization - structuring of the propositions to be included in the text according to an appropriate rhetorical plan; finally lexical choice and syntactic realization - phrasing of the information using appropriate lexical items and syntactically correct constructions. The paper provides examples of the use of argumentative features to influence the generator's decisions throughout the generation process. The introduction of argumentative features allows the designer of a text generator to account for linguistic decisions that were not addressed in previous work, such as the selection of judgment determiners (many, few), scalar adjectives (interesting, difficult), connotative verbs (require, necessitate, enjoy, struggle) and connectives (but, therefore). Argumentative features are also used to organize the paragraph in a coherent manner. They are finally used to select appropriate information from a database to satisfy a given persuasive goal. The paper shows how the same descriptive device - the topoi introduced by Anscombre and Ducrot - can serve as the unifying representation level during the whole generation process and build a bridge between the conceptual and linguistic components of the generator. © 1995.",1995,,Journal of Pragmatics,24,01-Feb,189-220,,10.1016/0378-2166(94)00096-W,,#6652,Elhadad 1995,,,0
A mechanism of persuasion among agents for group choice design support systems,"Ito, T.; Shintani, T.","In this paper, we propose a group decision support system based on persuasion among agents. In the system. each user manages an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) system and an agent. Each user subjectively constructs a decision hierarchy and determines the various weights of alternatives by using AHP. Based on the hierarchy and weights, agents negotiate with each other on behalf of their users. In general, existing systems use a voting method for negotiating among agents. However, the result of voting are often inconsistent, largely due to the inconsistency of voting rules. Therefore, we propose a persuasion mechanism, rather than voting methods, for negotiation among agents. Adopting some of the features of AHP, we implement a new persuasion mechanism. The agents have an explanation mechanism. They can explain to their users why they have been persuaded, when they are persuaded, who persuaded them, and how they are persuaded. Finally, we describe the results from our current experiments. The results demonstrate that the persuasion mechanism is an effective method for a group decision support system based on multi-agent negotiation. © 1998 Scripta Technica.",1998,,Systems and Computers in Japan,29,5,20-28,,10.1002/(sici)1520-684x(199805)29:5<20::aid-scj3>3.0.co;2-p,,#6653,Ito 1998,,,0
Refining instructional text generation after evaluation,"De Rosis, F.; Grasso, F.; Berry, D.C.","In this paper, we describe how user-adapted explanations about drug prescriptions can be generated from already existing data sources.

This would require either thoroughly revising the text planning techniques employed or converting to a multistep generation architecture. We justify why we selected this second alternative and propose some heuristics to repair problems found in the first version of the generator.

A Multi-Agent Architecture Based on Active Mental Entities,"Baroni, P.; Fogli, D.; Guida, G.; Mussi, S.","In this paper, we propose an approach to the design of multi-agent systems based on an original model of the mental activity of single agents. In particular, we introduce the concept of active mental entity, as a new way of representing mental attitudes such as intentions and persuasions. The internal architecture of each agent is thus understood as a distributed system whose reasoning activity is determined by the interactions among active mental entities. Then, this architecture is extended in order to enable the agents to operate in a multi-agent context. A detailed description of the structure and operation of an agent and of a multi-agent system is thus provided. The implementation of the proposed paradigm is then illustrated and some performance examples are presented.",1998,,Informatica (Ljubljana),22,4,475-484,,,,#6656,Baroni 1998,,,0
Coping with conflict in cooperative knowledge-based systems,"Wong, S.T.C.","Cooperative Problem Solving (CPS) is an important paradigm that will extend the power of current information systems to provide broader, cheaper services and to solve larger, and increasingly, more complex problems. In this paper, we address a critical issue of this new mode of computing: the existence of conflict among distributed agents. In particular, we focus our study on Cooperative Knowledge-Based Systems (CKBS). To obtain a better understanding and more balanced judgement of multiagent conflict, we provide a general scheme to study the logical structure of multiagent conflict and rational strategies of coping with it under different situations. Our research finding is that there is no grand unified theory of coping with conflict in performing complex real-world computer supported tasks. Instead, a library of alternative methods should be considered. We discuss four methods: inquiry, arbitration, persuasion, and accommodation. These methods can be combined in an order appropriate to the application domain such that if one method fails, the system will try the next.

Evaluation stages and design steps for knowledge-based systems in medicine,"Rossi-Mori, A.; Pisanelli, D.M.; Ricci, F.L.","After the early experiments in artificial intelligence a methodology is emerging around advanced systems for the management of medical knowledge. The stress is moving away from the implementation of prototypes to the evaluation. It is possible to adapt and to apply this to field evaluation techniques already developed in similar contexts of knowledge management (books, drugs, epidemiology, consultants, etc.). The time is ready for a further step: to envisage a methodology for the design of real systems that cope with the 'knowledge environment' of the user. Every stage of the evaluation process is re-examined here, and considered as a framework to define goals and criteria about a step of design: (1) the impact of the system on the progress of health care provision (priorities, cost-benefit analysis, share of tasks among different media); (2) effectiveness in the end-user's environment and long-term effects on his behaviour (changes in people's role and responsibilities, improvements in the quality of data, acceptance of the system); (3) the intrinsic efficiency of the system apart from the operational context (correctness of the knowledge base, appropriateness of the reasoning). The need to differentiate the test sample into three classes (obvious, typical, atypical) is emphasized, discussing the influence on both evaluation and design. In particular the difficulty of having 'gold standards' on atypical cases, due to the disagreement among the experts, leads to the definition of two alternative attitudes: the 'standardization mode' and the 'brain-storming mode'. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.",1990,,Informatics for Health and Social Care,15,3,191-204,,10.3109/14639239009025267,,#6659,Rossi-Mori 1990,,,0

Credit scoring model for fintech lending: An integration of large language models and FocalPoly loss,"Xia, YF; Han, ZY; Li, YW; He, LY","Fintech lending experiences high credit risk and needs an efficient credit scoring model, but it also faces limited data sources and severe class imbalance. We develop a novel two-stage credit scoring model (called LLM-FP-CatBoost) by solving the two issues simultaneously. Large language models (LLMs) initially extract narrative data as a supplementary credit dataset. A new FocalPoly loss is then incorporated with CatBoost to handle the class imbalance problem. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that the proposed LLM-FP-CatBoost significantly outperforms the benchmarks in most circumstances. When making pairwise comparisons between LLMs on the fintech lending dataset, we found that the Chinese-specific LLM, i.e., ERNIE 4.0, achieves the best overall performance, followed by GPT-4 and BERT-based models. The performance decomposition reveals that the superiority is mainly attributed to the new data source extracted by the LLMs. The SHAP algorithm further ensures the interpretability of LLM-FP-CatBoost. The superiority of the proposed LLM-FP-CatBoost model remains robust to hyperparameters of the loss function, specific LLMs, and other extraction methods of narrative data. Finally, we discuss some managerial implications concerning credit scoring in fintech lending. (c) 2024 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Harnessing Large Language Models for Automatic Evaluation of Mobile Health Applications Based on Persuasive System Design Principles and Mobile Application Rating Scale,"Afsin, Y; Temizel, TT","Mobile applications have seen a growing prevalence in the healthcare sector, yet the absence of comprehensive regulations and preliminary assessments can lead to significant frustration and time loss for users. To address this, Persuasive System Design (PSD) principles and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) have emerged as popular tools for gauging application quality and user engagement. However, their manual assessment requirements hinder scalability, especially given the high volume of mobile health applications in the market. This study introduces a novel automatic evaluation approach designed to enhance the assessment of mobile health applications, leveraging PSD and MARS. The proposed method mainly relies on large language models to filter user reviews and generate sentence embeddings for classifying the PSD principles implemented in these applications. The results, calculated using performance metrics that compare the model's predictions with expert evaluations, demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the application's implementation of PSD principles based on user reviews while also highlighting the limitations of using application descriptions alone for successful prediction. Furthermore, the study augments the predicted classification probabilities of PSD principles with supplementary descriptive data, such as installation counts and user ratings, to predict MARS scores. Regression models, trained using these techniques, consistently outperform basic models, with feature importance scores showing the significant contribution of predicted classification probabilities of PSD principles to the models. In summary, this study suggests that automatic evaluation techniques can effectively assess the quality and user engagement of mobile health applications, offering a viable alternative to manual assessments.",2024,,"PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2024",14636,,Jan-14,WOS:001280411900001,10.1007/978-3-031-58226-4_1,,#6698,Afsin 2024,,,0
Practices of Using Chatbots with Artificial Intelligence by Russian Teenagers,"Ushkin, SG; Koval, KA","The use of generative artificial intelligence is becoming widespread. Generative artificial intelligence is developing very quickly and unpredictably, so the level of risks for users is increasing. Users face algorithmic discrimination, bias, misinformation and nudges to change behavior. Teenagers are one of the most vulnerable groups who use neural network technologies in everyday life. They do not always understand the level of risks associated with new technologies, but at the same time they are often the pioneers and the most active users who are not afraid of experiment. An urgent scientific task is to study how teenagers use neural network technologies that can communicate with a person in natural language. Also of interest are adolescents' motives for using such technologies and how they evaluate possible risks. The research method is a survey of schoolchildren in grades 8-11 from two Russian regions - the Republic of Mordovia and the Donetsk People's Republic (n = 600). The study was carried out at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. It is revealed that teenagers, regardless of their region of residence, generally know what chatbots with artificial intelligence are. However, those who have experience using such chatbots are mainly young men with high academic achievements, studying in grades 10-11. Neural network technologies are perceived in a utilitarian way, as assistants or advanced Internet search engines. Based on the uses and gratifications theory, it is proved that there are four main motives in the structure of teenagers using chatbots motivation.

Analysis of Chinese Typical Lane Change Behavior in Car-Truck Heterogeneous Traffic Flow from UAV View,"Li, CZ; Chen, H; Xiong, YZ; Chen, YF; Zhao, SL; Duan, JL; Li, KQ","Chinese driver behavior in heterogeneous traffic is commonly available, but it is difficult to acquire due to view limitations and sensor limitations. In this study, Chinese typical lane change behavior in car-truck heterogeneous traffic flow was collected and analyzed using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The velocity of ego vehicle, relative velocity and distance of ego and surrounding vehicles, time to collision (TTC), time headway (THW) at the lane change moment, and brake and accelerate reaction time during lane changes were investigated. Results showed that large differences existed in various car follow types and lane change types. Cars drove more aggressively than trucks with shorter reaction times, and cars would change lanes at a longer distance when facing trucks. Smaller TTC and THW were found for trucks when facing cars. Chinese drivers showed more frequent lane-change maneuvers and shorter reaction times compared to other countries. The driver characteristic in China provided data support for the training of artificial intelligence-based decision algorithms, the development of a localized system, and the design of roads.",2022,,ELECTRONICS,11,9,,WOS:000795362300001,10.3390/electronics11091398,,#6710,Li 2022,,,0
Rethinking Environmental Disclosure,"Brett, A","Twenty years ago, legal scholars and regulators alike were convinced that information-forcing regulations heralded a new era in environmental law. Coming off the success of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which seemed to decrease toxic chemical pollution solely by forcing industry to disclose if they released certain chemicals, many called information regulation the third wave of environmental law. New information disclosure policies were enacted and old policies reinvigorated, leading to a plethora of informationbased regulations throughout environmental law. Now, twenty years later, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to environmental analysis have only further increased the belief in the benefits of information-forcing approaches. In this time, the central premise that information regulation works to change behavior and improve environmental outcomes has been largely unquestioned. Despite the widespread enthusiasm, after decades of implementation it is increasingly clear that information regulation largely fails to achieve its environmental goals. This Article makes two main contributions. By drawing on quantitative and qualitative case studies of information-forcing regulations, it first answers the question of whether this approach to environmental regulation is effective. It evaluates the success of information-forcing policies, finding that these policies often fail both to change behavior towards improving environmental conditions and to achieve other stated goals. This Article then analyzes the mechanisms behind information forcing in conjunction with these case studies to propose characteristics that determine the success, or failure, of information regulation. It finds that contrary to popular belief, persuasive and economic mechanisms not drive environmental behavior change. Instead, information- forcing regulations with legal mechanisms of action show the most promise and efficacy. Moving beyond sweeping promises of efficiency and transparency to understand the specific characteristics that make these programs successful is essential moving forward into an era of big environmental data.",2024,,CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW,112,,1535-1589,WOS:001342120800001,10.15779/Z38T727H47,,#6717,Brett 2024,,,0
Predicting reward-based crowdfunding success with multimodal data: A theory-guided framework,"Bao, LQ; Chen, G; Liu, ZX; Xiao, SY; Zhao, HM","There is a growing need to investigate the impact of multimodal data, which are becoming increasingly prevalent on crowdfunding platforms, on prediction of fundraising outcomes. However, a prediction framework drawing upon rational theoretical foundations to leverage multimodal data in crowdfunding is still lacking. Guided by relevant theories, we explore the ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions of multimodal data geared toward fundraising success prediction. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates superior predictive utilities of various metafunction-based multimodal features over purely data-driven ones. Our results also reveal that the multiple data modalities interact complementarily and synergistically to improve the prediction performance. Specifically, combining metafunctions improved prediction performance by 2-15 % over a single metafunction, while multimodality outperformed single data modality by 7-18 % within each metafunction.",2025,,INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT,62,4,,WOS:001443677600001,10.1016/j.im.2025.104131,,#6722,Bao 2025,,,0
"The Wildcard XAI: from a Necessity, to a Resource, to a Dangerous Decoy","Carli, R; Calvaresi, D","There has been a growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (henceforth XAI) models among researchers and AI programmers in recent years. Indeed, the development of highly interactive technologies that can collaborate closely with users has made explainability a necessity. This intends to reduce mistrust and the sense of unpredictability that AI can create, especially among non-experts. Moreover, the potential of XAI as a valuable resource has been recognized, considering that it can make intelligent systems more user-friendly and reduce the negative impact of black box systems. Building on such considerations, the paper discusses the potential dangers of large language models (LLMs) that generate explanations to support the outcomes produced. While these models may give users the illusion of control over the system's responses, they actually have persuasive and non-explanatory effects. Therefore, it is argued here that XAI, appropriately regulated, should be a resource to empower users of AI systems. Any other apparent explanations should be reported to avoid misleading and circumventing effects.",2024,,"EXPLAINABLE AND TRANSPARENT AI AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS, EXTRAAMAS 2024",14847,,224-241,WOS:001336429000013,10.1007/978-3-031-70074-3_13,,#6747,Carli 2024,,,0
Framework to Specify Dialogues for Natural Interaction with Conversational Assistants Applied in Prompt Engineering,"Porto, AVF; Furtado, MES","This article explores the significance of Natural Interaction (NI) in the context of conversational assistants (CAs), aiming to model user dialogues through written and/or spoken language. By NI notion, we consider it is a grammar-free communication language as close as possible to human interaction through written and spoken language, and serves as a highly intuitive means of interaction. It eliminates the need for users to learn new commands, making tasks more accessible. This research addresses the question of which elements and constraints can be employed in crafting NI dialogues for CAs. The emergence of large language models (as ChatGPT) has transformed dialogue specification, reducing the role of producers and enabling users to configure and qualify dialogues based on their needs. The response's quality and user understanding now depend on how well dialogues are specified.

How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them: Rethinking Persuasion to Challenge AI Safety by Humanizing LLMs oThis paper contains jailbreaking contents that can be offensive in nature.,"Zeng, Y; Lin, HP; Zhang, JW; Yang, DY; Jia, R; Shi, WY","Most traditional AI safety research views models as machines and centers on algorithmfocused attacks developed by security experts. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. Observing this, we shift the perspective, by treating LLMs as human-like communicators to examine the interplay between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak risk across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 92% on Llama-2-7b-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in 10 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for more fundamental solutions for AI safety",2024,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS",,,14322-14350,WOS:001391776305028,,,#6760,Zeng 2024,,,0
The power of human-like virtual-influencer-generated content: Impact on consumers' willingness to follow and purchase intentions,"Rungruangjit, W; Mongkol, K; Piriyakul, I; Charoenpornpanichkul, K","The swift progress in machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, and interactive immersive media technologies has led to the introduction of computer-generated imagery on Instagram. This feature, so-called ""human-like virtual influencers (VIs)"", has revolutionized the way people interact with technology. Using a combination of cutting-edge AI technologies, in a novel application of computer vision algorithms, and large language models to extract the content posted by two popular human-like VIs on Instagram, the present study is the first to categorize and classify types of human-like virtual-influencer-generated content. Quantitative methods, such as partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), were used to examine the impact of human-like virtual-influencer-generated content on consumers' willingness to follow as well as purchase intentions. The information was gathered from 650 Thai customers. The findings showed that consumers' willingness to follow and purchase intentions were significantly influenced by the positive effects of emotional appeal content, which includes relational, entertaining, positive emotion, and negative emotion content. These effects outweighed those of rational appeal content, such as informative and remunerative content, as well as authenticity appeal content. Meanwhile, disclosing sponsored content had no effect on consumers' willingness to follow. The theoretical underpinnings of uses and gratifications (U&G) theory, parasocial relationships and Richins' hierarchical model of emotions are confirmed and expanded upon in this work, and the suggested inclusive approach also significantly advances the expanding corpus of research on VIs.

A framework for estimating the matric suction in unsaturated soils using multiple artificial intelligence techniques,"Wang, JJ; Vanapalli, S","Implementation of the state-of-the-art understanding of the mechanics of unsaturated soils into geotechnical engineering practice is partly limited due to the lack of quick, reliable, and economical techniques for matric suction measurement. Matric suction is one of the key stress state variables that significantly influences the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils. In this paper, to address this objective, two artificial intelligence (AI) models were developed for estimating matric suction in unsaturated soils based on the particle swarm optimization support vector regression (PSO-SVR) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) algorithms. The results suggest that both these models can reasonably estimate matric suction. Compared to the MARS model, the PSO-SVR model can achieve higher accuracy. Nonetheless, the MARS model facilitates the sensitivity analysis and the selection of essential inputs. A novel integrated framework is proposed and validated, leveraging the strengths, and alleviating the limitations of the PSO-SVR and MARS algorithms for reliable and rapid estimation of matric suction in the range of 0-1500 kPa for low plastic soils (0 < I-p <= 7). Six inputs are required to use this model successfully; some can be measured using conventional laboratory tests, and others can be calculated from mass-volume relationships.",2024,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS,48,11,2854-2879,WOS:001217139100001,10.1002/nag.3755,,#6777,Wang 2024,,,0
Skill Awareness Framework for Learning Design - Re-focusing Experiential Learning Towards Skills that Matter Most in Times of GenAI,"Nelles, J; Müller, FA; Ramnane, K; Blackwell, E; Atre, MP; De Guzman, C; Lacopeta, C; Bingen, S; Hammer, M","The authors introduce a Skills Awareness Framework for Learning Design (SAFLD) to provide guiding principles for learning. Corporate learning is in a state of flux due to disruptive influences such as COVID-19 and the digitalization of the world of work, even into the home office. In the age of generative AI where knowledge is seemingly available at the touch of a button, corporate learning is more than ever challenged to re-focus on teaching critical and relevant skills. Therefore, in the sense of self-reflection, it will be discussed that learning in the moment will still need to be complemented by experiences that change behaviors. These include both cognitive and motor skills and are based on inter- and intra-action of learners and trainers both individually and as a team. When it comes to re-focusing experiential learning towards skills that matter most, learning factories, e.g., the Innovation and Learning Centers or Model-Factories-in-a-Box, play an even more important role than ever before. This hypothesis is supported by Bloom's taxonomy which classifies learning objectives and illustrates that some skills or higher proficiency levels of skills might be acquired by digital, self-paced e-learning or by virtual, instructor-led learning sessions, whereas other skills or higher proficiency levels of skills and deep learning that change behavior might be better acquired by experiential learning. Finally, learning factories can also play a role in bringing the emerging GenAI to life in an application-oriented environment such as a shop floor.",2024,,"LEARNING FACTORIES OF THE FUTURE, VOL 2, CLF 2024",1060,,153-160,WOS:001323759000018,10.1007/978-3-031-65400-8_18,,#6779,Nelles 2024,,,0
Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control,"Gu, HK; Wang, SB; Jia, DY; Zhang, YL; Luo, YR; Mao, GQ; Wang, JP; Lim, EG","Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify that the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules-GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks-RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.",2025,,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS,,,,WOS:001480257800001,10.1109/TITS.2025.3556931,,#6788,Gu 2025,,,0
A game theoretical model to examine pedestrian behaviour and safety on unsignalised slip lanes using AI-based video analytics,"Arafat, ME; Kaye, SA; Schroeter, R; Haque, MM","Left-turn slip lanes, also known as channelised right-turn lanes in right-hand driving countries, are widely implemented to facilitate left-turning at signalised intersections. However, pedestrian safety on slip lanes is not well known. At unsignalised crosswalks, the joint decision-making process of both pedestrians and motorists is complex, involving joint communication dynamics, yet current research primarily focuses on examining individual decisions. This study proposes a game theory-based approach, formulating the interaction as a two-player, non-cooperative, simultaneous game to examine those joint decision-making dynamics, their resulting behaviours, and associated crash risks. The approach compares two well-known equilibriums of game theory, namely Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and Nash Equilibrium (NE), based on real-world pedestrian-motorist interaction video data collected over two days, each day spanning 12 h, from two slip lanes with zebra crossings at signalised intersections in Brisbane, Australia. Artificial intelligence-based video analytics extracted interaction data, which was modelled using binary logit models to understand the crossing and yielding decisions of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that the QRE outperforms the NE in predicting the crossing intention of pedestrians and the yielding intention of motorists. Results indicate that a) motorists are less likely to yield to pedestrians when the vehicle speed is higher, b) pedestrians are more likely to let the motorists go first if they start crossing from the curbside of the road, and c) motorists are more likely to yield to pedestrians when the distance between pedestrians and vehicles is longer. According to the QRE model, the probability of conflict is 5.8%, indicating that 5.8% of pedestrian interactions with vehicles in these slip lanes result in conflicts. Similarly, the confusion probability indicates that about 5.2% of pedestrians were confused about initiating crossing in the presence of zebra crossing even though drivers yielded them on slip lanes at signalised intersections. This study highlights the significance of using game theory-based approaches to understand road users' behaviour on slip lanes. These findings can help to identify pedestrian crossing intentions and support connected automated vehicles in making stopping decisions to enhance pedestrian safety and reduce potential conflicts with other road users.",2025,,ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION,217,,,WOS:001474853700001,10.1016/j.aap.2025.108034,,#6793,Arafat 2025,,,0

Assistive Conversational Agent for Health Coaching: A Validation Study,"Fadhil, A; Wang, YL; Reiterer, H","Objective Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians, the conversational agent gives weighting to user's adherence, based on prior defined conditions.Materials and Methods This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users.Results We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet, and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition, we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation.Conclusions The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social, yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences; (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities; (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals' daily messaging routine; and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component.Future Work Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users' interaction data and integrating users' dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g., machine learning).

Persuasion-Building Fundamental Premises and Implications for Conversational Agents: A Conceptual Model in Captology,"Anggia, P; Sumi, K","In the area of captology, computers as persuasive technology, conversational agent or dialogue system represent an interactive computing product as a key to changing people's viewpoints. Our former original experimental research addressed that a virtual agent's positive facial expressions and near-distance camera angle successfully influence participants' thoughts during an experiment. However, fragmentation in this growing topic led to theoretical confusion. To move the field forward, this paper uncovers the evidence-based elements as the standard compliance for designing the persuasive conversational agent. First, the fundamental premises, implications, constructs, and indicators from our previous original research were generated. Second, a theory synthesis from related articles on the interaction between virtual agents to humans, with the aim of persuading, was analyzed. Thus, it derives twelve fundamental premises, two implications, three main constructs, and fifteen indicators. Third, a model elaborates on the relationships between these constructs and indicators was developed. Its foundation is based on the three related concepts of the Persuasion Knowledge Model, Stimulus-Organism-Response Theory, Fogg's Captology Framework, and one measurement model of Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. Hence, the theory synthesis provides the basis for inventing the proposed conceptual model, called the Agent-Subject Persuasion Model (ASPM), which emphasizes the originality of this research.",2023,,"PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2023",13832,,275-289,WOS:001286452400018,10.1007/978-3-031-30933-5_18,,#6810,Anggia 2023,,,0

Effectiveness and acceptability of conversational agents for sexual health promotion: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"Balaji, D; He, LW; Giani, S; Bosse, T; Wiers, R; de Bruijn, GJ","Digital health interventions for sexual health promotion have evolved considerably alongside innovations in technology. Despite these efforts, studies have shown that they do not consistently result in the desired sexual health outcomes. This could be attributed to low levels of user engagement, which can hinder digital health intervention effectiveness, as users do not engage with the system enough to be exposed to the intervention components. It has been suggested that conversational agents (automated two-way communication systems e.g. Alexa) have the potential to overcome the limitations of prior systems and promote user engagement through the increased interactivity offered by bidirectional, natural language-based interactions. The present review, therefore, provides an overview of the effectiveness and user acceptability of conversational agents for sexual health promotion. A systematic search of seven databases provided 4534 records, and after screening, 31 articles were included in this review. A narrative synthesis of results was conducted for effectiveness and acceptability outcomes, with the former supplemented by a meta-analysis conducted on a subset of studies. Findings provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of conversational agents for promoting sexual health, particularly treatment adherence. These conversational agents were found to be easy to use and useful, and importantly, resulted in high levels of satisfaction, use and intentions to reuse, whereas user evaluations regarding the quality of information left room for improvement. The results can inform subsequent efforts to design and evaluate these interventions, and offer insight into additional user experience constructs identified outside of current technology acceptance models, which can be incorporated into future theoretical developments.",2022,,SEXUAL HEALTH,19,5,391-405,WOS:000828694800001,10.1071/SH22016,,#6831,Balaji 2022,,,0

Persuasive Conversational Agent with Persuasion Tactics,"Narita, T; Kitamura, Y","Persuasive conversational agents persuade people to change their attitudes or behaviors through conversation, and are expected to be applied as virtual sales clerks in e-shopping sites. As an approach to create such an agent, we have developed a learning agent with the Wizard of Oz method in which a person called Wizard talks to the user pretending to be the agent. The agent observes the conversations between the Wizard and the user, and learns how to persuade people. In this method, the Wizard has to reply to most of the user's inputs at the beginning, but the burden gradually falls because the agent learns how to reply as the conversation model grows.Generally speaking, persuasion tactics is important to persuade people efficiently, but it is also useful to reduce the burden of the Wizard because it guides the Wizard to a way of persuasion. In this paper, we explicitly implement persuasion tactics into the persuasive conversation agent.

"Persuasion, task interruption and health regimen adherence","Bickmore, T; Mauer, D; Crespo, F; Brown, T","Cueing strategies, such as real-time reminders, are among the most effective methods of persuading individuals to perform healthy behaviors such as taking their medication and exercising. However, these reminders often represent a task interruption for users who are engaged in work activities. This paper presents the results of a study which explores strategies for interrupting users at work to perform a healthy behavior, in which the primary outcome of interest is long-term adherence to a desired health behavior change regimen. We find that the degree of perceived politeness of interruptions is positively correlated with predicted long-term adherence, but negatively correlated with short-term compliance. We also find that, among several interruption coordination strategies previously explored in the literature, empathic interruptions are superior overall in gaining both short-term compliance and long-term adherence.",2007,,PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY,4744,,01-Nov,WOS:000252076100001,,,#6866,Bickmore 2007,,,0
DESCRIBING AND ANIMATING COMPLEX COMMUNICATIVE VERBAL AND NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR USING EVA-FRAMEWORK,"Mlakar, I; Kacic, Z; Rojc, M","Multimodal interfaces incorporating embodied conversational agents enable the development of novel concepts with regard to interaction management tactics in responsive human-machine interfaces. Such interfaces provide several additional nonverbal communication channels, such as natural visualized speech, facial expression, and different body motions. In order to simulate reactive humanlike communicative behavior and attitude, the realization of motion relies on different behavioral analyses and realization tactics and approaches. This article proposes a novel environment for ""online"" visual modeling of humanlike communicative behavior, named EVA-framework. In this study we focus on visual speech and nonverbal behavior synthesis by using hierarchical XML-based behavioral events and expressively adjustable motion templates.

Language Use in Conversational Agent-Based Health Communication: Systematic Review,"Shan, Y; Ji, M; Xie, WX; Qian, XB; Li, RY; Zhang, XM; Hao, TY","Background: Given the growing significance of conversational agents (CAs), researchers have conducted a plethora of relevant studies on various technology- and usability-oriented issues. However, few investigations focus on language use in CA-based health communication to examine its influence on the user perception of CAs and their role in delivering health care services.Objective: This review aims to present the language use of CAs in health care to identify the achievements made and breakthroughs to be realized to inform researchers and more specifically CA designers.Methods: This review was conducted by following the protocols of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 statement. We first designed the search strategy according to the research aim and then performed the keyword searches in PubMed and ProQuest databases for retrieving relevant publications (n=179). Subsequently, 3 researchers screened and reviewed the publications independently to select studies meeting the predefined selection criteria. Finally, we synthesized and analyzed the eligible articles (N=11) through thematic synthesis.Results: Among the 11 included publications, 6 deal exclusively with the language use of the CAs studied, and the remaining 5 are only partly related to this topic. The language use of the CAs in these studies can be roughly classified into six themes: (1) personal pronouns, (2) responses to health and lifestyle prompts, (3) strategic wording and rich linguistic resources, (4) a 3-staged conversation framework, (5) human-like well-manipulated conversations, and (6) symbols and images coupled with phrases. These derived themes effectively engaged users in health communication. Meanwhile, we identified substantial room for improvement based on the inconsistent responses of some CAs and their inability to present large volumes of information on safety-critical health and lifestyle prompts.Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of language use in CA-based health communication. The results and limitations identified in the 11 included papers can give fresh insights into the design and development, popularization, and research of CA applications. This review can provide practical implications for incorporating positive language use into the design of health CAs and improving their effective language output in health communication. In this way, upgraded CAs will be more capable of handling various health problems particularly in the context of nationwide and even worldwide public health crises.",2022,,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH,24,7,,WOS:000828200900008,10.2196/37403,,#6869,Shan 2022,,,0

Spontaneous empathy and the explicitly expressed intention of non-responsive VAs to deliver user support is likely capable to engage and motivate users. Responsive VAs have even larger potential. However, they are more costly to realize and have a higher risk of failure.

What Drives Consumers' Decisions to Use Intelligent Agent Technologies? A Systematic Review,"Sidlauskiene, J","As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it will increasingly empower the successful use of intelligent agent (IA) technologies in marketing practices. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer's perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers' intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal.",2022,,JOURNAL OF INTERNET COMMERCE,21,4,438-475,WOS:000686807800001,10.1080/15332861.2021.1961192,,#6924,Sidlauskiene 2022,,,0
"Digital preconception interventions targeting weight, diet and physical activity: A systematic review","OConnor, H; Willcox, JC; de Jersey, S; Wright, C; Wilkinson, SA","AimOptimising preconception health increases the likelihood of conception, positively influences short- and long-term pregnancy outcomes and reduces intergenerational chronic disease risk. Our aim was to synthesise study characteristics and maternal outcomes of digital or blended (combining face to face and digital modalities) interventions in the preconception period.MethodsWe searched six databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, CINHAL and PsycINFO) from 1990 to November 2022 according to the PRISMA guidelines for randomised control trials, quasi-experimental trials, observation studies with historical control group. Studies were included if they targeted women of childbearing age, older than 18 years, who were not currently pregnant and were between pregnancies or/and actively trying to conceive. Interventions had to be delivered digitally or via digital health in combination with face-to-face delivery and aimed to improve modifiable behaviours, including dietary intake, physical activity, weight and supplementation. Studies that included women diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics quality criteria checklist. Study characteristics, intervention characteristics and outcome data were extracted.ResultsTen studies (total participants n=4,461) were included, consisting of nine randomised control trials and one pre-post cohort study. Seven studies received a low risk of bias and two received a neutral risk of bias. Four were digitally delivered and six were delivered using blended modalities. A wide range of digital delivery modalities were employed, with the most common being email and text messaging. Other digital delivery methods included web-based educational materials, social media, phone applications, online forums and online conversational agents. Studies with longer engagement that utilised blended delivery showed greater weight loss.ConclusionMore effective interventions appear to combine both traditional and digital delivery methods. More research is needed to adequately test effective delivery modalities across a diverse range of digital delivery methods, as high heterogeneity was observed across the small number of included studies.",2024,,NUTRITION & DIETETICS,81,3,244-260,WOS:001084203900001,10.1111/1747-0080.12842,,#6935,OConnor 2024,,,0
Generative AI and the future of marketing: A consumer protection perspective,"Duivenvoorde, B","Generative AI has the potential to be the biggest disruption in marketing since the emergence of digital commerce in the early 2000s. This article will focus on three ways in which generative AI is expected to change marketing. First, generative AI enables companies to automatically create advertising copy and images, potentially leading to significant cost reductions. Secondly, generative AI offers possibilities to improve and automate personalised marketing, potentially enabling companies to send the right persuasive message at the right time to each potential customer. Thirdly, generative AI potentially offers possibilities to market products to consumers via generative AI chatbots. These developments offer potential advantages but also bear risks for consumers. For example, deepfakes in advertising can mislead consumers, AI-generated personalised marketing can exploit consumer vulnerabilities, and B2C chatbots can deceive consumers by providing biased advice. This article shows that EU law does in principle provide protection to consumers in relation to AI-generated marketing, but is also likely to fall short in effectively protecting consumers against the identified risks in several ways.",2025,,COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW,57,,,WOS:001487115300001,10.1016/j.clsr.2025.106141,,#6952,Duivenvoorde 2025,,,0

A longitudinal study on artificial intelligence adoption: understanding the drivers of ChatGPT usage behavior change in higher education,"Polyportis, A","As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to progress, the use of AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in higher education settings has gained significant attention. This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students' ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students' ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students' ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students' ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education. The findings also provide actionable guidance for AI developers and educational institutions seeking to optimize student engagement with AI technologies.",2024,,FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,6,,,WOS:001144530300001,10.3389/frai.2023.1324398,,#6966,Polyportis 2024,,,0

Motivational interviewing skills practice enhanced with artificial intelligence: ReadMI,"Hershberger, PJ; Pei, Y; Bricker, DA; Crawford, TN; Shivakumar, A; Castle, A; Conway, K; Medaramitta, R; Rechtin, M; Wilson, JF","BackgroundFinding time in the medical curriculum to focus on motivational interviewing (MI) training is a challenge in many medical schools. We developed a software-based training tool, ""Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing"" (ReadMI), that aims to advance the skill acquisition of medical students as they learn the MI approach. This human-artificial intelligence teaming may help reduce the cognitive load on a training facilitator.MethodsDuring their Family Medicine clerkship, 125 third-year medical students were scheduled in pairs to participate in a 90-minute MI training session, with each student doing two role-plays as the physician. Intervention group students received both facilitator feedback and ReadMI metrics after their first role-play, while control group students received only facilitator feedback.ResultsWhile students in both conditions improved their MI approach from the first to the second role-play, those in the intervention condition used significantly more open-ended questions, fewer closed-ended questions, and had a higher ratio of open to closed questions.ConclusionMI skills practice can be gained with a relatively small investment of student time, and artificial intelligence can be utilized both for the measurement of MI skill acquisition and as an instructional aid.",2024,,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,24,1,,WOS:001179818700001,10.1186/s12909-024-05217-4,,#6984,Hershberger 2024,,,0
Physics instructors' acceptance and implementation of generative AI,"Wattanakasiwich, P; Kaewkhong, K; Katwibun, D","[This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Artificial Intelligence Tools in Physics Teaching and Physics Education Research.] This study investigates physics instructors' acceptance and implementation of generative AI (GenAI) in physics education, guided by Rogers' diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, focusing on its five-stage innovation-decision process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Two survey versions were developed-one for GenAI users and another for nonusers. Data were collected through an online survey featuring five-point Likert scale items and open-ended questions, yielding 320 responses from high school and university physics instructors. The persuasion stage was explored in depth using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). A mixed-method approach combining quantitative structural equation modeling (SEM) and qualitative content analysis was employed. We found instructors distributed across different adoption stages, with key barriers including insufficient technical knowledge (51.75% of nonusers) and language processing limitations (50.5% of users). Hedonic motivation (/3 = 0.498) was found to have a substantially stronger influence on adoption than performance expectancy (/3 = 0.121), with an effect size approximately 4 times greater. We identified significant differences between paid and free GenAI users, with paid users more likely to request prompt-writing guidance (30.56% vs 6.47%) despite using more advanced models. Support needs also varied substantially, as half of paid users requested budget support for GenAI services compared to only 17.65% of free users. Most physics instructors used GenAI primarily for assessment tasks, particularly for generatingphysics problems with solutions. Their primary concerns included incorrect physics information in GenAI responses, potential negative impacts on students' analytical thinking, language barriers, and challenges with prompt writing. These findings suggest that successful GenAI integration in physics education requires physics-specific training and differentiated support based on whether instructors use free or paid versions of GenAI tools.",2025,,PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH,21,1,,WOS:001504680900001,10.1103/r2fn-kdy4,,#6985,Wattanakasiwich 2025,,,0
Using Artificial Intelligence in Infection Prevention,"Fitzpatrick, F; Doherty, A; Lacey, G","Purpose of ReviewArtificial intelligence (AI) offers huge potential in infection prevention and control (IPC). We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene.Recent FindingsAI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed.SummaryAdvantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting.

This work aims to analyze the possibility of applying AI technology in language production by comparing the lexico-grammatical features of abstracts created with the help of ChatGPT and written by British and American researchers. Methodology: Twenty papers written by researchers affiliated with UK universities and twenty by researchers affiliated with American universities were selected from the journals listed under the first quartile of the Web of Science and Scopus. Using the titles that were from the selected works, 40 abstracts were generated from ChatGPT for comparison. Each article was introduced with its title, and ChatGPT was asked to create an abstract based on the title. Subsequently, the subjects were examined with the help of Biber's (1991) multivariate model considering five dimensions, which include the Informational vs Involved discourse, the Narrative vs Non-narrative, the Explicit vs. Situation- dependent discourse, Overt expression of argumentation/persuasion and the Impersonal/Abstract style as opposed to the Nonimpersonal/Non-abstract style.

We synthesized findings of AIMC-based interventions for adult populations in cancer prevention/control or substance use, applying SIGN Methodology Checklist 2 for quality assessments and reviewing retention and engagement.Results Initial screening identified 187 studies; seven met inclusion criteria, involving 2768 participants. Females comprised 67.6% (n = 1870). Mean participant age was 42.73 years (SD = 7.00). Five studies demonstrated significant improvements in substance use recovery, physical activity, genetic testing, or dietary habits.Conclusions AIMC shows promise in enhancing health behaviors, but further exploration is needed on privacy risks, biases, safety concerns, chatbot features, and serving underserved populations.Implications There is a critical need to foster comprehensive fully powered studies and collaborations between technology developers, healthcare providers, and researchers. Policymakers can facilitate the responsible integration of AIMC technologies into healthcare systems, ensuring equitable access and maximizing their impact on public health outcomes.We conducted a systematic review on behavioral interventions using Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication in the contexts of cancer prevention/control and substance use.Researchers conducted a thorough review of how Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication (AIMC) can influence behavior in cancer prevention/control and substance use. They analyzed seven studies involving nearly 2800 adults, mostly women, focusing on outcomes like substance use recovery and lifestyle changes. Six studies reported randomized controlled trials, focusing on interventions for substance use and other health behaviors. Several studies showed promising results, such as improved physical activity and dietary habits. Studies varied in design: one was a single-arm trial, while others had multiple arms or stratified randomization. Most trials used validated outcome measures and reported high retention rates. Despite promising results in behavior change, sustainability beyond treatment was rarely reported. Studies highlighted demographic diversity and employed intent-to-treat or per-protocol analyses. Challenges included blinding issues and potential biases. Overall, the trials emphasized the need for comprehensive, rigorous research in AI-mediated health interventions. The review highlighted the need for more research on privacy concerns, biases, and the effectiveness of AIMC tools, especially for underserved populations.

Despite relevance to marketing theory and practice, deepfakes-and the opportunities for benefit or deviance they provide-are little understood or discussed. This article introduces deepfakes to the marketing literature and proposes a typology, conceptual framework, and associated research agenda, underpinned by theorizing based on balanced centricity, to guide the future investigation of deepfakes in marketing scholarship. The article makes an argument for balance (i.e., situations where all stakeholders benefit), and it is hoped that this article may provide a foundation for future research and application of deepfakes as ""a new hope"" for marketing.",2021,,AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL,29,3,204-214,WOS:000691323200002,10.1177/1839334921999479,,#7033,Whittaker 2021,,,0

Artificial intelligence or the challenge of the century Anatomy of a radical antihumanism,"Contreras, RP","""Artificial Intelligence or the Challenge of the Century: Anatomy of a Radical Antihumanism"" by eric Sadin examines, from a phenomenology of artifacts perspective, the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and the challenges it poses. The author conceives AI as a global system composed of devices interconnected with beings and objects in the world, whose behavior is continuously monitored and digitally influenced through algorithms. Specifically, the power of this ""algorithmic Leviathan"" lies not only in its ability to handle vast amounts of information, rendering human minds dispensable, but also in its administration based on a numerical regime of truth. To comprehend this, Sadin introduces the concepts of ""aletheic potency"" and ""kairos power."" Aletheic potency refers to the persuasive capacity of AI to articulate ""truths"" that align with our preferences and expectations. On the other hand, kairos power enables AI to swiftly respond to its shortcomings through compensatory actions that minimize our dissatisfaction, thus keeping us captive within its infallible logic. In summary, the emergence of AI signifies a change in the status of technologies, challenging our relationship with the world, as it is expected to enunciate truth through automated interpretation of situations and make decisions on our behalf. This represents the stage of techno-logos of technique: not logos about technique produced by humans, but humans shaped by a technique capable of generating discourse or truth.",2023,,COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK,25,4,461-463,WOS:001014478300001,10.1007/s10111-023-00730-w,,#7036,Contreras 2023,,,0

"Artificial intelligence, marketing management, and ethics: their effect on customer loyalty intentions: A conceptual study","Mgiba, FM","The purpose of this study was to address ethical issues of privacy, information security, discrimination, and diversity concerns in the Artificial intelligence context, and to show how they relate to customers' loyalty intentions. The outcome sought was the development of a conceptual model that relates these themes to the actions of marketing management practitioners. An extensive review of literature on Persuasive technology, Social penetration, and Transforming wellbeing theories formed the basic structure for this study. After reviewing and synthesizing empirical literature on the major themes, and linking them to the constructs extracted from the grounding theories, the author generated a list of propositions that relate them to each other and the constructs. These propositions led to the development of a conceptual model. Researchers that deal with ethical issues and new technology can empirically test this model. The conceptualized model extends the explanatory powers of these grounding theories, by showing how they can improve business practices under the fourth industrial revolution era. This can aid management practitioners on artificial intelligence management strategies, and mitigate negative consequences related to the application of advanced technologies in business. This study is based on the literature, and, therefore, carries with it all the limitations that are inherent in the articles accessed.

A Blueprint for an AI & AR-Based Eye Tracking System to Train Cardiology Professionals Better Interpret Electrocardiograms,"Sqalli, MT; Al-Thani, D; Elshazly, MB; Al-Hijji, M","The electrocardiogram is one of the most used medical tests worldwide. Despite its prevalent use in the healthcare sector, there exists a limited understanding in how medical practitioners interpret it. This is mainly due to the scarcity of international guidelines that unify its interpretation across different health institutions. This leads to a lack of training and unpreparedness by medical students who are about to join the medical workforce. In this paper, we propose a blueprint for a proactive artificial intelligence and augmented reality-based eye tracking system to train cardiology professionals for a better electrocardiogram interpretation. The proposed blueprint is inspired from extensive interviews with cardiology medical practitioners as well as students who interpret electro-cardiograms as part of their daily practice. The interviews contributed to identifying the major pain-points within the process of electrocardiogram interpretation. The interviews were also critical in conceptualizing the persuasive components of the training system for a guided correct electrocardiogram interpretation. Throughout the presented blueprint, we detail the three components that constitute the system. These are the augmented reality-based interactive training interface, the artificial intelligence-based processing sub-system, and finally the adaptive electrocardiogram dataset.",2022,,PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2022),13213,,221-229,WOS:000784740900017,10.1007/978-3-030-98438-0_17,,#7071,Sqalli 2022,,,0
Development of a Living Lab for a Mobile-Based Health Program for Korean-Chinese Working Women in South Korea: Mixed Methods Study,"Kim, Y; Lee, H; Lee, MK; Jang, H","Background: Korean-Chinese (KC) women make up the largest group of female migrants in South Korea. To prevent and manage chronic diseases in middle-aged KC women working full time, it is necessary to develop health promotion programs that utilize an online platform because such a platform would allow individuals to participate in health promotion interventions at their convenience.Objective: This study aimed to develop a living lab for a mobile-based health (LLm Health) program focused on improving the physical activity and cultural adaptation of KC women workers.Methods: We used a mixed methods design. Living lab principles were factored into the LLm Health program, including the use of multiple methods, user engagement, multistakeholder participants, real-life settings, and cocreation. The program was developed using the 4 steps of the intervention mapping method: needs assessment, setting of objectives, identification of intervention strategies, and intervention design. Needs assessment was conducted through a literature review, focus group interviews with a total of 16 middle-aged KC women, and an online survey related to health promotion of migrant workers given to 38 stakeholders. KC middle-aged women participated in the early stages of program development and provided the idea of developing programs and mobile apps to enhance physical activity and acculturation. The mobile app developed in the program was validated with the help of 12 KC women and 4 experts, including 3 nursing professors and a professor of physical education. They were asked to rate each item based on content, interface design, and technology on a 4-point scale using a 23-item Smartphone App Evaluation Tool for Health Care.Results: The LLm Health program comprised a 24-week walking program using Fitbit devices, the mobile app, and social cognitive interventions. The mobile app contained 6 components: a step counter, an exercise timer, an online chat function, health information, level of cardiovascular risk, and health status. The cultural aspects and lifestyles of KC women were accommodated in the entire process of program development. The content validity of the mobile app was found to be 0.90 and 0.96 according to the 12 KC women and 4 experts, respectively.Conclusions: The mobile app was found to be valid and acceptable for KC women. The living lab approach was a useful strategy for developing a culturally adaptive LLm Health program for KC women workers, leading to their active participation in the overall research process, including needs assessment, program composition, and pre-evaluation.",2020,,JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH,8,1,,WOS:000506824600001,10.2196/15359,,#7079,Kim 2020,,,0
"Leveraging Mobile Phone Sensors, Machine Learning, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Predict Imminent Same-Day Binge-drinking Events to Support Just-in-time Adaptive Interventions: Algorithm Development and Validation Study","Bae, SW; Suffoletto, B; Zhang, TZ; Chung, T; Ozolcer, M; Islam, MR; Dey, AK","Background: Digital just-in-time adaptive interventions can reduce binge-drinking events (BDEs; consuming >= 4 drinks for women and >= 5 drinks for men per occasion) in young adults but need to be optimized for timing and content. Delivering just-in-time support messages in the hours prior to BDEs could improve intervention impact.Objective: We aimed to determine the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) model to accurately predict future, that is, same-day BDEs 1 to 6 hours prior BDEs, using smartphone sensor data and to identify the most informative phone sensor features associated with BDEs on weekends and weekdays to determine the key features that explain prediction model performance.Methods: We collected phone sensor data from 75 young adults (aged 21 to 25 years; mean 22.4, SD 1.9 years) with risky drinking behavior who reported their drinking behavior over 14 weeks. The participants in this secondary analysis were enrolled in a clinical trial. We developed ML models testing different algorithms (eg, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost] and decision tree) to predict same-day BDEs (vs low-risk drinking events and non-drinking periods) using smartphone sensor data (eg, accelerometer and GPS). We tested various ""prediction distance"" time windows (more proximal: 1 hour; distant: 6 hours) from drinking onset. We also tested various analysis time windows (ie, the amount of data to be analyzed), ranging from 1 to 12 hours prior to drinking onset, because this determines the amount of data that needs to be stored on the phone to compute the model. Explainable artificial intelligence was used to explore interactions among the most informative phone sensor features contributing to the prediction of BDEs.Results: The XGBoost model performed the best in predicting imminent same-day BDEs, with 95% accuracy on weekends and 94.3% accuracy on weekdays (F1-score=0.95 and 0.94, respectively). This XGBoost model needed 12 and 9 hours of phone sensor data at 3-and 6-hour prediction distance from the onset of drinking on weekends and weekdays, respectively, prior to predicting same-day BDEs. The most informative phone sensor features for BDE prediction were time (eg, time of day) and GPS-derived features, such as the radius of gyration (an indicator of travel). Interactions among key features (eg, time of day and GPS-derived features) contributed to the prediction of same-day BDEs. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility and potential use of smartphone sensor data and ML for accurately predicting imminent (same-day) BDEs in young adults. The prediction model provides ""windows of opportunity,"" and with the adoptionof explainable artificial intelligence, we identified ""key contributing features"" to trigger just-in-time adaptive intervention prior to the onset of BDEs, which has the potential to reduce the likelihood of BDEs in young adults.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02918565; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02918565",2023,,JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,7,,,WOS:000998490100049,10.2196/39862,,#7084,Bae 2023,,,0
RETRACTED: Beliefs and Practice Evaluation Based on Artificial Intelligence Models under the IP Environment (Retracted Article),"Zhou, Y","The digitization of thought theory is not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the students.

Minding the source: toward an integrative theory of human-machine communication,"Lee, EJ","According to the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, a dominant theoretical framework for research on human-computer interaction, people treat computers as if they were people. Recent studies on human-machine communication (HMC) and human-artificial intelligence (AI) interaction, however, appear to focus on when and how people respond to machines differently than to human agents. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, this study reviews critically the two overarching theoretical explanations proposed and tested in each respective tradition, the mindlessness account and the machine heuristic. After elaborating on several conceptual and operational issues with each explanatory mechanism, an alternative theoretical model of HMC is proposed that integrates both research traditions and generates predictions that potentially deviate from the dual-process models. Lastly, it is discussed how recent developments in AI technology invite modifications to the current understanding of HMC and beyond.",2024,,HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH,50,2,184-193,WOS:001090907800001,10.1093/hcr/hqad034,,#7089,Lee 2024,,,0
Stimulating or Intimidating: The Effect of AI-Enabled In-Store Communication on Consumer Patronage Likelihood,"van Esch, P; Cui, Y; Jain, SP","Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated the marketing landscape and is having a profound impact on businesses' communication strategies. With AI coming under the spotlight, we know surprisingly little about its impact on consumers' patronage likelihood. This research attempts to address this void by investigating the ""just-walk-out"" retail technology in cohort with in-store communication. Across three studies, conducted online and in the field, the authors demonstrate that, compared to self-service checkouts, AI-enabled checkouts lead to significantly higher consumers' patronage likelihood. Furthermore, sensory stimulation stemming from in-store communication (environmental cues including assortment, advertising, and technology) underlies this impact. Importantly, the extent to which consumers perceive AI technology to be threatening is revealed as a boundary condition to these effects. These findings advance our understanding of how AI-enabled checkouts and in-store communication influence consumers' patronage likelihood and the boundary condition that moderates their impact.",2021,,JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,50,1,63-80,WOS:000587520400001,10.1080/00913367.2020.1832939,,#7090,vanEsch 2021,,,0

"Ambient Engineering: Hyper-Nudging, Hyper-Relevance, and Rhetorics of Nearness and Farness in a Post-AI Algorithmic World","Rickert, T","This essay argues that algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) are producing a transformation in the economics of attention. Attention is a limited concept, a point I demonstrate by providing a phenomenological understanding of attending via Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, specifically showing the usefulness of the existential and platial concepts of nearness and farness. Emerging, AI-driven techniques of hyper-nudging and hyper-relevance address themselves to our senses of nearness and farness. Hyper-relevance is particularly significant as it is proleptic in trying to anticipate concernful engagement, without directly soliciting it, by transforming the conditions of possibility for modes of attending. I call such techniques ambient engineering, which are concerned with transforming the conditions for producing salience. Ambient engineering has consequences for rhetorical practice and theory, including greater focus on subattentive engagements, and thus also an elision of more traditional forms of suasion.",2024,,RHETORIC SOCIETY QUARTERLY,54,5,513-513,WOS:001300317400001,10.1080/02773945.2024.2378024,,#7092,Rickert 2024,,,0

Also, this study explores how customers perceive the AI agent as the manager working with either a human or an AI representative. Across three experiments (using a scenario or a combination of a scenario and the real AI chatbot), the study shows that consumers perceive the AI manager more positively in terms of likeability, knowledgeability, and trustworthiness than the AI representative and the human manager. The customers perceive the AI manager more positively when they are transferred to the AI manager from a representative of the same kind (AI) than from a human representative. Further, the job titles given to the AI agents are found to have favorable downstream effects on customer satisfaction, brand attitude, and the customers' intentions to buy the products recommended during the chat by the AI manager.",2022,,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,145,,892-904,WOS:000798782300008,10.1016/j.jbusres.2022.03.028,,#7102,Jeon 2022,,,0

Influence of human versus AI recommenders: The roles of product type and cognitive processes,"Wien, AH; Peluso, AM","Previous research suggests that consumers would listen more to product recommendations from other consumers (human recommenders) than from systems based on artificial intelligence (AI recommenders). We hypothesize that this might depend on the type of product being recommended, and propose an underlying process driving this effect. Three experiments show that, for hedonic products (but not for utilitarian products), human recommenders are more effective than AI recommenders in influencing consumer reactions toward the recommended product. This effect occurs because, when compared to AI recommenders, human recommenders elicit stronger mentalizing responses in consumers. This, in turn, helps consumers self-reference the product to their own needs. However, humanizing AI recommenders increases mentalizing and self-referencing responses, thus increasing the effectiveness of this type of recommenders for hedonic products. Together, these findings provide insight into when and why consumers might rely more on product recommendations from humans as compared to AI recommenders.",2021,,JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH,137,,13-27,WOS:000705512600002,10.1016/j.jbusres.2021.08.016,,#7110,Wien 2021,,,0

This experiment tests the hypothesis that receiving brand recommendations from an intelligent personal assistant believed to be tailored to one's own characteristics and consumer interests yields higher brand attitude and purchase intention toward the (self-endorsed) brand than receiving brand recommendations from a typical, but not self-tailored, intelligent personal assistant. Because endorsement is a well-known and highly effective advertising strategy, this is a high bar. We present evidence for self-referencing as an underlying mechanism, and perceived interactivity and identification as boundary conditions of self-endorsing. Consumers may show skepticism toward advertising but may not know how to be skeptical of themselves. As consumers outsource their tasks and decisions to new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven devices, they will need to be attentive to new media biases that threaten productive use of these devices.",2021,,NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY,23,6,1506-1526,WOS:000553834400001,10.1177/1461444820912197,,#7113,Hamilton 2021,,,0

The Logical Approach of Legal Argumentation,"Feteris, ET",In a logical approach of legal argumentation the central focus is on the role of formal validity as a criterion of rationality for legal argumentation. Various logical systems have been developed to analyse and evaluate legal argumentation. This chapter explains the role and the importance of formal logic for the analysis and evaluation of legal argumentation. Section 2.2 describes the role of formal logic as criterion of rationality for legal argumentation. Section 2.3 describes the various logical systems for the reconstruction of legal argumentation.

Positing a Sense of Agency-Aware Persuasive AI: Its Theoretical and Computational Frameworks,"Legaspi, R; Xu, WZ; Konishi, T; Wada, S","The notion of a persuasive technology (PT) that is autonomous and intelligent, and more importantly, cognizant of and sensitive to human sense of agency (SoA), i.e., the subjective feeling or judgement that oneself is in control of situations, remains to be theorized, conceptualized and elucidated. Three important questions have emerged from our investigations: (1) why does SoA matter in the design of PT, (2) what computational principles in artificial intelligence (AI) underlie an adaptive PT, and (3) how can this intelligent PT sense, make sense of, and respond sensibly to dynamic changes in SoA under complex settings? We elucidate in this paper our theoretical and computational frameworks to answer our research queries. For the theoretical aspect, we propose an integration of pertinent theories in the cognitive, social and neurosciences that explain the emergence and disruption of SoA. Using this integration as theory of mind, we propose a computational framework for SoA-aware persuasive AI that integrates methods in cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, causal inferencing, explainable AI planning and generative actor-critic learning.",2021,,PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2021),12684,,Mar-18,WOS:000788285600001,10.1007/978-3-030-79460-6_1,,#7120,Legaspi 2021,,,0
Preparing for an Era of Deepfakes and AI-Generated Ads: A Framework for Understanding Responses to Manipulated Advertising,"Campbell, C; Plangger, K; Sands, S; Kietzmann, J","Traditionally, the production and distribution of advertising material has relied on human effort and analog tools. However, technological innovations have given the advertising industry digital and automatic tools that enable advertisers to automate many advertising processes and produce ""synthetic ads,"" or ads comprising content based on the artificial and automatic production and modification of data. The emerging practice of synthetic advertising, to date the most sophisticated form of ad manipulation, relies on various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deepfakes and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to automatically create content that depicts an unreal, albeit convincing, artificial version of reality. In this article, a general framework is constructed to better understand how consumers respond to all forms of ad manipulation. It is anticipated that this article will help explain how consumers respond to the more sophisticated forms of synthetic ads-such as deepfakes-that are emerging at an accelerating rate. To guide research in this area, a research agenda is developed focusing on three manipulated advertising areas: ad falsity, consumer response, and originality. Furthermore, the implications for theory and industry are considered.",2022,,JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING,51,1,22-38,WOS:000651731900001,10.1080/00913367.2021.1909515,,#7138,Campbell 2022,,,0
"Process patents, gamification anduserand user protection from the Iramuteq software analysis","do Monte, WS; Feitosa, ERM; De-Bortoli, R","The new interactive technologies together with the development of artificial intelligence, have raised discussions not only for their transformations in society but also the search for understanding the protection not only of the organizations' intellectual property but also of the users they use. Protecting processes from technological innovations is important as well as protecting users. Authors such as Negroponte (1999), Pierre Levy (2009) and Yuval Harari (2018), help to understand these technical-social transformations and their impacts on society. This article aims to analyze the interrelationship between the viable ones: patents, processes, gamification and only user protection. Through the software IRAMUTEQ, with nine textual corpus (conclusions of articles), 50 text segments were used for analysis, of which 40 were considered to correspond to 74.67% of the data. The method used was exploratory descriptive with a qualitative approach. From the analyzed corpus, 6 classes were suggested, which were grouped into: General concepts, Process/Technology Patents and User Protection, the results confined the interrelationship between variables, that is, thus presenting the need for a debate on protection to users who are exposed to the increasing amount of technologies and innovations, developed with the purpose of modifying their behavior.

Defending Truth and Democracy in the Age of AI: A Framework for Empowering Voters Against Persuasion and Misinformation with AI Literacy,"Arda, Z; Basarir, L","Witnessing the rising impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a post-truth envi-ronment, our senses' credibility wanes as the distinction between the real and the imagined becomes increasingly hazy. This study examines AI-generated content and deepfakes' effects on voters by analyzing their use in Turkish and American politics over the past decade. The ease and speed of creating fake news with AI necessitate constant verification, yet regulation is often lacking, heightening daily anxiety about reality. With the EU's imminent AI law, this article highlights the dangers of media advocacy (the strategic use of media to influence public opinion) and misinformation (spreading incorrect or misleading information). Through a meticulous literature review, press release analysis, and case studies, the study assesses their possible persuasive impact on voters, elections, and democracy. It identifies the associated risks and proposes a framework to empower voters using technology to reinforce ""truth filters,"" Intelligence Augmentation, and ""AI litera-cy.""

Gamification in Physical Activity: State-of-the-Art,"Hariri, M; Stone, R","activity is decreasing globally, and more people are becoming sedentary, which is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. To counter this trend, gamification emerges as a promising strategy for enhancing participation in physical activity interventions. The review investigates the influence of gamified systems on the promotion of physical activity and examines associated behavioral and psychological outcomes. The analysis incorporates empirical studies focused on adult participants, published in peer-reviewed English-language journals over the last five years. Several critical aspects are considered in the analysis, including specific types of physical activity targeted, employed gamification systems, involved motivational features, and behavioral and psychological outcomes, thus offering a state-of-the-art overview of gamification and physical activity. Findings confirm that gamification serves as an effective mechanism for promoting physical activity. To address gaps in existing research, recommendations for future work include broadening the range of metrics used for measuring physical activity and investigating the psychological benefits of gamification in physical activity interventions. Moreover, future research could benefit from leveraging addictive game design elements and utilizing artificial intelligence and computer vision models to monitor user progress and suggest appropriate challenges. In conclusion, the review outlines the considerable potential of gamification to positively affect participation in physical activity, highlighting the need for additional research to fully realize this potential.",2023,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,14,10,1003-1012,WOS:001126021300001,,,#7152,Hariri 2023,,,0
Pain Management Mobile Applications: A Systematic Review of Commercial and Research Efforts,"Koumpouros, Y; Georgoulas, A","Shared decision making is crucial in the pain domain. The subjective nature of pain demands solutions that can facilitate pain assessment and management. The aim of the current study is to review the current trends in both the commercial and the research domains in order to reveal the key issues and guidelines that could further help in the effective development of pain-focused apps. We searched for scientific publications and commercial apps in 22 databases and the two major app stores. Out of 3612 articles and 336 apps, 69 met the requirements for inclusion following the PRISMA guidelines. An analysis of their features (technological approach, design methodology, evaluation strategy, and others) identified critical points that have to be taken into consideration in future efforts. For example, commercial and research efforts target different types of pain, while no participatory design is followed in the majority of the cases examined. Moreover, the evaluation of the final apps remains a challenge that hinders their success. The examined domain is expected to experience a substantial increase.

"ChatGPT Is Powerful, but Does It Have Power Distance? A Study of Culturally Imbued Discourse in AI-Generated Essays","Schenck, A","Power distance (PD), a cultural value denoting acceptance of asymmetrical power relationships, influences the force of rhetoric used by a writer to address their reader. However, AI technologies such as ChatGPT lack an explicit awareness of PD, which could affect the quality of AI-generated persuasive texts used for language learning. To investigate this issue, 200 persuasive essays written by ChatGPT were compared to 200 essays written by L1-English university learners. Three elements of formulaic language related to PD were examined: stances, modals, and pronoun deixis. Differences in stances (z = -3.411; p = .001) and modals (z = -2.100; p = .036) were both significant according to the Wilcoxon signed ranks formula, whereas differences in pronoun deixis were nearly significant (z = -1.917; p = .055). Overall, language of ChatGPT appears generic and incomplete, suggesting that consistent and uniform expressions are being borrowed from an LLM training corpus to mimic aspects of PD.

"Do Tourists Prefer Dialectal Service? The Role of Processing Fluency, Distinctiveness, and Cultural Learning Cues","Xiong, XL; Sun, DN; Wong, IA; Lian, QL","Serving tourists in dialect can be a double-edged sword, as the literature acknowledges it may hamper language processing fluency while offering a sense of distinctiveness for tourists. Building on Two-Factor Theory of Emotion, this research contributes to the literature by articulating a paradoxical process in which dialectal service can be internalized as both an enabling and an inhibiting factor in understanding a local culture. It further proposes a facilitating mechanism through cultural learning cues. We conducted three empirical experiments (Studies 1-3), followed by an external validation process through generative AI (Study 4), and finally employed methodological triangulation through semistructured interviews (Study 5).

Navigating the design of simulated exercising peers: insights from a participatory design study,"Silacci, A; Cherubini, M; Caon, M","Background To fight sedentary lifestyles, researchers have introduced various technological interventions aimed at promoting physical activity through social support. These interventions encourage people to exercise together, maintaining high levels of motivation. However, the unpredictable nature of human peers makes it challenging to control behavior and balance these interventions effectively. Artificial intelligence agents, on the other hand, can provide consistent social support and are more controllable. Hence, we propose Simulated Exercising Peers (SEPs) as a promising solution for providing agent-based social support for physical activity.Method Participatory design sessions were conducted, involving young adults in the creation of SEP-based interventions. Sixteen participants generated four prototypes that varied in aesthetics, behavior, and communication style, with outcomes analyzed through the lens of Self-Determination Theory to better understand the motivational implications of each design.Results Findings highlight key components crucial for designing SEPs that enhance acceptance and efficiently integrate into physical activity interventions. Additionally, the study revealed how the aesthetics and behavior of SEPs could potentially deceive users, which can lead to user disengagement from interventions involving SEPs. Participants also defined two distinct social roles for the SEPs, i.e., coach, and companion, each associated with unique communication styles.Conclusion This study offers five design guidelines for the development of SEPs, AI agents aimed at promoting physical activity through social support, and highlights opportunities for their integration into broader physical activity interventions.",2025,,FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH,7,,,WOS:001494458200001,10.3389/fdgth.2025.1551966,,#7168,Silacci 2025,,,0

The Problem of AI Hallucination and How to Solve It,"Jancarík, A; Dusek, O","AI in education is a topic that has been researched for the last 70 years. However, the last two years have seen very significant changes. These changes relate to the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model has dramatically influenced how the public approaches artificial intelligence. For many, generative language models have become synonymous with AI and have come uncritically viewed as a universal source of answers to most questions. However, it soon became apparent that even generative language models had their limits. Among the main problems that emerged was hallucination (providing answers containing false or misleading information), which is expected in all language models. The main problem of hallucination is that this information is difficult to distinguish from other information, and AI language models are very persuasive in presenting it. The risks of this phenomenon are much more substantial when using language modules to support learning, where the learner cannot distinguish correct information from incorrect information. The proposed paper focuses on the area of AI hallucination in mathematics education. It will first show how AI chatbots hallucinate in mathematics and then present one possible solution to counter this hallucination. The presented solution was created for the AI chatbot Edu-AI and designed to tutor students in mathematics. Usually, the problem is approached so that the system verifies the correctness of the output offered by the chatbot. Within the Edu-AI, checking responses is not implemented, but checking inputs is. If an input containing a factual query is recorded, it is redirected, and the answer is traced to authorised knowledge sources and study materials. If a relevant answer cannot be traced in these sources, a redirect to a natural person who will address the question is offered. In addition to describing the technical solution, the article includes concrete examples of how the system works. This solution has been developed for the educational domain but applies to all domains where users must be provided with relevant information.",2024,,"PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING, ECEL 2024",23-Jan,,122-128,WOS:001438533400015,,,#7178,Jancarík 2024,,,0
Persuasive Contrastive Explanations for Bayesian Networks,"Koopman, T; Renooij, S","Explanation in Artificial Intelligence is often focused on providing reasons for why a model under consideration and its outcome are correct. Recently, research in explainable machine learning has initiated a shift in focus on including so-called counterfactual explanations. In this paper we propose to combine both types of explanation in the context of explaining Bayesian networks. To this end we introduce persuasive contrastive explanations that aim to provide an answer to the question Why outcome t instead of t'? posed by a user. In addition, we propose an algorithm for computing persuasive contrastive explanations.

Individualized self-care training systems for type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review on characteristics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs),"Tanhapour, M; Mohammadzadeh, N; Kalhori, SRN; Shakibian, H; Peimani, M; Esfahani, EN","Self-care is crucial for managing chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Successful self-care is complex and influenced by many factors. Regarding the effectiveness of digital health (DH) systems on T2D self-care behaviors, this research aims to systematically review the characteristics of such systems employed in randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies. Searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Science Direct were conducted from January 2011 to February 2022. The RCTs incorporated in this study provide personalized, tailored self-care training tips for individuals diagnosed with T2D. The National Institute of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute tool for controlled intervention studies was used for risk of bias assessment. A total of 26 studies were eligible. M-Health solutions were the most exciting technology for developing T2D self-care DH systems (22/26 studies). Blood glucose monitoring (88.46%), physical activities (76.92%), healthy diet (69.23%), and medication adherence (57.69%) were DH interventions' top self-care priorities. DH systems were mainly used for self-care data collecting (100%), recommendations (96.15%), and monitoring data analysis (84.62%). Educational (100%) and motivational (50%) themes were used for self-care interventions in most trials. We found that DH systems improve the most critical T2D self-care features (BG monitoring, physical exercise, healthy food, and medication adherence). However, more T2D pharmacoadherence trials are needed.

Mood Themes the World,"Stenner, J; Ulmer, GL","Apparatus theory (a hybrid of McLuhan and Derrida) hypothesizes that a civiliza-tion of electracy (the digital apparatus) must learn how to thrive in a lifeworld in which the visceral faculty of appetite is hegemonic. The dominant axis of behavior today is fantasy -anxi-ety (attraction/repulsion). We propose that world theming has created a vernacular discourse that may be raised to a second power of expression as vehicle of visceral intelligence. The immediate claim is that theming in digital media augments mood (ambiance) into a power of imagination, just as dialectic in writing augmented logic into a power of reason. Fantasy today is persuasive, just as logical entailment is (was) in the rational order of literacy. Decisions de-termining real events today are being made in worlds of mood.World theming is evident in the vernacular art practices arising from recent advanc-es in artificial intelligence. The availability of commodity GPUs, along with public access to advanced research via GitHub, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and the proliferation of forums such as Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and others, has resulted in a renaissance of public engagement with technology-informed creative practice. In addition, the general availability of Google's previously internal-only development tool, Colab, in late 2017 provided access to cloud-based GPUs and storage systems accessible only to data scientists and academics. In early 2021 Ryan Murdock released a Colab notebook called Big Sleep that combined Ope-nAI's recently published Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with BigGAN. This model is a paradigmatic example of our observation. By early 2022, multiple derivations of this process incorporated alternative image generation techniques.

A Novel Key Influencing Factors Selection Approach of P2P Lending Investment Risk,"Xia, PF; Ni, ZW; Zhu, XH; Ni, LP","Recent frequent ""thunderstorm incidents"" of P2P lending industry have caused the panic of industry investors. To predict the investment risk of P2P lending, we should scientifically and rationally analyze the key influencing factors of P2P lending investment risk. Existing key influencing factors selection methods mainly involve traditional statistical approaches and artificial intelligence methods. The traditional statistical approaches cannot deal with the high-dimensional nonlinear problems, and it cannot find the exact key influencing factors of the P2P lending investment risk. The artificial intelligence methods cannot recognize and learn the application background, and the selected attributes without active thinking and personal perception may not be the key influencing factors of P2P lending investment risk. To address the above issues, a novel key influencing factors selection approach of P2P lending investment risk is proposed by combining the proposed fireworks coevolution binary glowworm swarm optimization (FCBGSO), multifractal dimension (MFD), probit regression, and artificial prior knowledge. First, multifractal dimension combined with the proposed FCBGSO is used to select the preliminary influencing factors of the investment risk; second, the nonsignificant relevant attributes in the preliminary influencing factors are removed using the probit regression, and we add the influencing factors extracted from the original dataset of P2P lending using the artificial prior knowledge into the retaining influencing factors after removing one by one. A small and reasonable number of influencing factor subsets are achieved. Finally, we evaluate each influencing factors subset using extreme learning machine (ELM), and the subset with the best classification accuracy is efficiently achieved, i.e., it is the key influencing factors of P2P lending investment risk. Experimental results on the real P2P lending dataset from the Renrendai platform demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than other state-of-the-art methods and that it has validity and effectiveness. It provides a new research idea for the key influencing factors selection of P2P lending investment risk.",2019,,MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING,2019,,,WOS:000502054400002,10.1155/2019/6086089,,#7201,Xia 2019,,,0

"SOFT LAW, HARD JUSTICE: REGULATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ARBITRATION","Reddy, JS; Singh, V","Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter ""A.I."") is predicated on the notion that a computer programme can mimic all aspects of intellect and learning if they were meticulously documented. A.I. is increasingly being used in international arbitration by various stakeholders, including experts, litigants, tribunals and arbitrators at different stages. However, while A.I. has become increasingly prevalent in arbitration, there is still a regulatory vacuum that needs be bridged. The increasing use of A.I. in arbitration to improve procedural efficiency and decision-making raises serious concerns about the lack of a strong regulatory framework. The use of unregulated A.I. raises multiple technological challenges, which have resulted in some courts mandating the disclosure of A.I. use. These concerns are exacerbated by A.I.s' limited capacity to comprehend cultural nuances. Additionally, legal and ethical considerations arise, such as the permissible extent of A.I. usage in the arbitral process by various players, the duty to verify A.I.-generated work, the question of liability brought upon due to risks of algorithmic bias, or the leak of confidential information. Research indicates a rise in calls for greater transparency in the use of A.I. in arbitration, and the need for regulation. While previous attempts to regulate A.I. certainly provide a starting point for the regulation of A.I. in the arbitral process, they are neither universally recognized, nor implemented across jurisdictions. In this backdrop, there is a need for an international legal instrument that either regulates, or encourages the regulation of A.I. in arbitration. The authors in this paper argue for the regulation of A.I. in arbitration using an internationally-recognised soft-law framework. The flexibility and adaptability provided by soft law frameworks would complement the ""international"" and voluntary nature of arbitration. The proposed soft law framework could materialize in three ways: first, regulators could develop an international legal instrument based on which States can develop their own laws (much like the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law); second, A.I.-related arbitrations could follow the soft law guidelines as best practices, with the guidelines having persuasive value similar to the International Bar Association (IBA) Rules; or third, soft law could encourage arbitration institutions to incorporate relevant clauses on A.I. use in their procedural rules. The authors also explore the considerations which such a soft law ought to address. The need for such a framework is not to draw boundaries, or control the innovative path of A.I., rather, it is to put in place ethical barriers and dynamic safeguards for identifiable risks, and to work in tandem with the requisite human oversight throughout the life cycles of A.I. processes. This would be a balanced approach which addresses issues of law, ethics, and technology on one hand, while encouraging creativity and flexibility in the field of arbitration on the other.",2024,,CONTEMPORARY ASIA ARBITRATION JOURNAL,17,2,191-236,WOS:001390383600002,,,#7208,Reddy 2024,,,0
Sponsorship Disclosure in Virtual Influencer Marketing: Assessing Users' Sentiment and Engagement Toward Virtual Influencer Endorsements,"Looi, J; Kim, E; Zihang, E","This study evaluates how sponsorship disclosure affects users' parasocial interaction with virtual influencers (VIs). Sentiment analysis of 48,147 comments (sponsored = 20,411, non-sponsored = 27,736) indicated that users expressed more positive sentiment toward the VI's sponsorship disclosure. Topic modeling revealed that, regardless of sponsorship disclosure, users were confused about the VI's identity and expressed mixed emotions. Users also behaved differently toward the VI's sponsorship disclosure. An online experiment (N = 159) found that users who encountered non-sponsored content displayed greater likelihood for parasocial interaction and post engagement.

Achieving Health Equity: The Power & Pitfalls of Intelligent Interfaces,"ASSOC COMP MACHINERY; Parker, AG","Digital health research-the investigation of how technology can be designed to support wellbeing-has exploded in recent years. Much of this innovation has stemmed from advances in the fields of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence. A growing segment of this work is examining how information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be used to achieve health equity, that is, fair opportunities for all people to live a healthy life. Such advances are sorely needed, as there exist large disparities in morbidity and mortality across population groups. These disparities are due in large part to social determinants of health, that is, social, physical, and economic conditions that disproportionately inhibit wellbeing in populations such as low-socioeconomic status and racial and ethnic minority groups.Despite years of digital health research and commercial innovation, profound health disparities persist. In this talk, I will argue that to reduce health disparities, ICTs must address social determinants of health. Intelligent interfaces have much to offer in this regard, and yet their affordances-such as the ability to deliver personalized health interventions-can also act as pitfalls. For example, a focus on personalized health interventions has lead to the design of various interfaces focused on individual-level behavior change. While such innovations are important, to achieve health equity there is also a need for complimentary systems that address social relationships. Social ties are a crucial point of focus for digital health research as they can provide meaningful supports for positive health, especially in populations that disproportionately experience health barriers. I will offer a vision for health equity research in which interactive and intelligent systems are designed to help people build social relationships that support wellbeing. By conceptualizing the purview of digital health research as encompassing not only individual but also social change, there is tremendous opportunity to create disruptive health interventions that help achieve health equity.",2021,,IUI '21 - 26TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES,,,05-Jun,WOS:000747690200004,10.1145/3397481.3457413,,#7221,ASSOCCOMPMACHINERY 2021,,,0
CHIEF JUSTICE ROBOTS,"Volokh, E","Say an AI program someday passes a Turing test, because it can converse in a way indistinguishable from a human. And say that its developers can then teach it to converse-and even present an extended persuasive argument-in a way indistinguishable from the sort of human we call a ""lawyer."" The program could thus become an AI brief-writer, capable of regularly winning brief-writing competitions against human lawyers.Once that happens (if it ever happens), this Essay argues, the same technology can be used to create AI judges, judges that we should accept as no less reliable (and more cost-effective) than human judges.

A Behavioral Economics Approach to Digitalisation - The Case of a Principles-based Taxonomy,"Beerbaum, D; Puaschunder, JM","A growing body of academic research in the field of behavioural economics, political science and psychology demonstrate how an invisible hand can nudge people's decisions towards a preferred option. Contrary to the assumptions of the neoclassical economics, supporters of nudging argue that people have problems coping with a complex world, because of their limited knowledge and their restricted rationality. Technological improvement in the age of information has increased the possibilities to control the innocent social media users or penalise private investors and reap the benefits of their existence in hidden persuasion and discrimination. Nudging enables nudgers to plunder the simple uneducated and uninformed citizen and investor, who is neither aware of the nudging strategies nor able to oversee the tactics used by the nudgers (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b). The nudgers are thereby legally protected by democratically assigned positions they hold. The law of motion of the nudging societies holds an unequal concentration of power of those who have access to compiled data and coding rules, relevant for political power and influencing the investor's decision usefulness (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b). This paper takes as a case the ""transparency technology XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)"" (Sunstein 2013, 20), which should make data more accessible as well as usable for private investors. It is part of the choice architecture on regulation by governments (Sunstein 2013). However, XBRL is bounded to a taxonomy (Piechocki and Felden 2007). Considering theoretical literature and field research, a representation issue (Beerbaum, Piechocki and Weber 2017) for principles-based accounting taxonomies exists, which intelligent machines applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Mwilu, Prat and Comyn-Wattiau 2015) nudge to facilitate decision usefulness. This paper conceptualizes ethical questions arising from the taxonomy engineering based on machine learning systems: Should the objective of the coding rule be to support or to influence human decision making or rational artificiality? This paper therefore advocates for a democratisation of information, education and transparency about nudges and coding rules (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b).",2018,,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL RAIS CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (RAIS 2018),211,,45-53,WOS:000468215200008,,,#7227,Beerbaum 2018,,,0
Exploring the Effect of Visual-Based Subliminal Persuasion in Public Speeches Using Explainable AI Techniques,"Weber, K; Tinnes, L; Huber, T; Andre, E","When it comes to persuading other people, non-verbal cues play an important role in order to be successful. Mostly, people use these non-verbal cues subconsciously and, from the perspective of the persuadee, are not aware of the subliminal impact of them. To raise awareness of subliminal persuasion, we analyzed videos of different political public speeches. We used the labels of three annotators to train three subjective neural networks capable of predicting their degree of perceived persuasiveness based on the images as input only. We then created visualizations of the predictions for each network/annotator to draw conclusions about what the annotators have most likely focused on. For that, we employed layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) that highlights the most relevant image sections for each prediction. Our results show that techniques like LRP can help uncover existing subliminal bias.",2023,,"ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HCI, AI-HCI 2023, PT I",14050,,381-397,WOS:001294395700023,10.1007/978-3-031-35891-3_23,,#7229,Weber 2023,,,0

We present five emergent features of this new paradigm of personalization that endanger persons and societies at scale and analyze their potential to reduce personal autonomy, destabilize social and political systems, and facilitate mass surveillance and social control, among other concerns. We argue that current data protection laws, most notably the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, are limited in their ability to adequately address many of these issues.

Modelling the Affective Power of Locutions in a Persuasive Dialogue Game,"Kacprzak, M; Sawicka, A; Zbrzezny, A","One of the most important contemporary directions of development in the field of artificial intelligence is to equip AI systems with emotional intelligence. This work is part of this trend. The paper presents a mathematical model that allows us to describe changes in players' emotional states as a response to dialogue actions. To this end, we use the paradigm of dialogue games and propose a method of rating locutions. The method is inspired by the affective rating system SAM which uses Mehrabian's PAD space which distinguishes emotions because of three attributes: Pleasantness (valence) (P), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Emotions that are analyzed are taken from Ekman's model with five universally accepted labels: fear, disgust, anger, sadness, and joy. In addition, we describe the emerging tool for the realization of dialogue games with emotional reasoning.

Argument Schemes and a Dialogue System for Explainable Planning,"Mahesar, QA; Parsons, S","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being increasingly deployed in practical applications. However, there is a major concern whether AI systems will be trusted by humans. To establish trust in AI systems, there is a need for users to understand the reasoning behind their solutions. Therefore, systems should be able to explain and justify their output. Explainable AI Planning is a field that involves explaining the outputs, i.e., solution plans produced by AI planning systems to a user. The main goal of a plan explanation is to help humans understand reasoning behind the plans that are produced by the planners. In this article, we propose an argument scheme-based approach to provide explanations in the domain of AI planning. We present novel argument schemes to create arguments that explain a plan and its key elements and a set of critical questions that allow interaction between the arguments and enable the user to obtain further information regarding the key elements of the plan. Furthermore, we present a novel dialogue system using the argument schemes and critical questions for providing interactive dialectical explanations.",2023,,ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY,14,5,,WOS:001087277500013,10.1145/3610301,,#7256,Mahesar 2023,,,0
On the Computation of Top-k Extensions in Abstract Argumentation Frameworks,"Jabbour, S; Raddaoui, B; Sais, L; Salhi, Y","Formal argumentation has received a lot of attention during the last two decades, since abstract argumentation framework provides the basis for various reasoning problems in Artificial Intelligence. Unfortunately, the exponential number of its possible semantics extensions makes some reasoning problems intractable in this framework. In this paper, we investigate the pivotal issue of efficient computation of acceptable arguments called extensions according to a given semantics. In particular, we address this aspect by applying a strategy of how to use preferences at the semantics level in order to determine what are ""desirable"" outcomes of the argumentation process. Then, we present a new approach for computing the Top-k extensions of an abstract argumentation framework, according to a user-specified preference relation. Indeed, an extension is a Top-k extension for a given semantics if it admits less than k extensions preferred to it with respect to a preference relation. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach and the accuracy of the proposed enumeration method.",2016,,ECAI 2016: 22ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,285,,913-920,WOS:000385793700107,10.3233/978-1-61499-672-9-913,,#7257,Jabbour 2016,,,0
Disparate Impact Diminishes Consumer Trust Even for Advantaged Users,"Draws, T; Szlávik, Z; Timmermans, B; Tintarev, N; Varshney, KR; Hind, M","Systems aiming to aid consumers in their decision-making (e.g., by implementing persuasive techniques) are more likely to be effective when consumers trust them. However, recent research has demonstrated that the machine learning algorithms that often underlie such technology can act unfairly towards specific groups (e.g., by making more favorable predictions for men than for women). An undesired disparate impact resulting from this kind of algorithmic unfairness could diminish consumer trust and thereby undermine the purpose of the system. We studied this effect by conducting a between-subjects user study investigating how (gender-related) disparate impact affected consumer trust in an app designed to improve consumers' financial decision-making. Our results show that disparate impact decreased consumers' trust in the system and made them less likely to use it. Moreover, we find that trust was affected to the same degree across consumer groups (i.e., advantaged and disadvantaged users) despite both of these consumer groups recognizing their respective levels of personal benefit. Our findings highlight the importance of fairness in consumer-oriented artificial intelligence systems.",2021,,PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2021),12684,,135-149,WOS:000788285600011,10.1007/978-3-030-79460-6_11,,#7260,Draws 2021,,,0

"Explanation in AI and law: Past, present and future","Atkinson, K; Bench-Capon, T; Bollegala, D","Explanation has been a central feature of AI systems for legal reasoning since their inception. Recently, the topic of explanation of decisions has taken on a new urgency, throughout AI in general, with the increasing deployment of AI tools and the need for lay users to be able to place trust in the decisions that the support tools are recommending. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the variety of techniques for explanation that have been developed in AI and Law. We summarise the early contributions and how these have since developed. We describe a number of notable current methods for automated explanation of legal reasoning and we also highlight gaps that must be addressed by future systems to ensure that accurate, trustworthy, unbiased decision support can be provided to legal professionals.

Goal Setting for Persuasive Information Systems: Five Reference Checklists,"Cham, S; Algashami, A; McAlaney, J; Stefanidis, A; Phalp, K; Ali, R","The concept of goals is prominent in information systems and also artificial intelligence literature such as goal-oriented requirements engineering and self-adaptive systems. Digital motivation systems, e.g. gamification and persuasive technology, utilise the concept of behavioural goals which require a different mind-set on how to elicit and set them up, how to monitor deviation from such goals and how to ensure their completion. Behavioural goals are characterised by a range of factors which are not the main focus in classic information systems and AI literature such as self-efficacy, perceived usefulness. To engineer software supporting goal setting, a concretised taxonomy of goals would help a better-managed analysis and design process. In this paper, we provide a detailed classification of behavioural goals and their associated properties and elements (types, sources, monitoring, feedback, deviation and countermeasures).

Towards Ethical Argumentative Persuasive Chatbots,"Al Anaissy, C; Vesic, S; Nevejans, N","Argumentative persuasive technologies are technologies that use argumentation in order to persuade the persuadee to believe in something or not, which can later lead the persuadee to perform an action or not. The use of such tools opens numerous ethical considerations. In this paper, we survey the literature on persuasion that might be useful for argumentative persuasive chatbots, we cover the existing legal framework and ethical principles and we critically analyze the new proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence of the European Commission. We also show how to use argumentation to enhance explainability and transparency of the persuasion systems. We propose to show the graphical representation of the arguments used during the persuasion to the user at the end of the dialogue, containing the relations between the arguments (attacks, supports), their origin (source), who uttered them (i.e. the machine or the human participant) and the persuasive methods employed. Our approach has several benefits. Namely, it makes the system more transparent and enhances the human understanding of the system, which is a benefit per se. Furthermore, the fact that the system is transparent increases the trust of the user, which (apart from being one of the goals of AI in general) can increase the chance that the user is persuaded by the system. Finally, the user can give a feedback on the presented arguments (e.g. how much they believe the arguments are ethical), which can be later used to improve the persuasion system.",2023,,"COORDINATION, ORGANIZATIONS, INSTITUTIONS, NORMS, AND ETHICS FOR GOVERNANCE OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS XVI, COINE 2023",14002,,141-160,WOS:001160581700008,10.1007/978-3-031-49133-7_8,,#7276,AlAnaissy 2023,,,0

Theoretically rooted in the Persuasion Knowledge Model, we aim to identify and investigate the prevalence of specific consumer groups that differ in their awareness levels, critical evaluations, and abilities to cope with such algorithmic persuasion in social media, as well as to investigate the predictors of these groups. By performing an online survey among a Dutch sample (n = 450) and a two-step cluster analysis, we identified four groups: the Control Paradox (the largest group), Fatigued, Uninformed but Critical, and Skilled and Critical. The four groups differed in respect to gender, age, education level, internet skills, self-reported knowledge of algorithms, privacy concerns, and perceived personalization of branded social media messages.

Three experiments were performed involving 678 participants. Overall, results suggest a double-edged sword effect of negative feedback in online and offline retail contexts. When compared to no feedback, neutral feedback, or positive feedback, negative feedback leads consumers to change their initial product choice whatever their choice uncertainty and whatever the feedback source (human advisor or algorithmic advisor). However, it also leads to the perception of more cognitive effort and reduced utilitarian value, resulting in lower purchase and word-of-mouth intentions.

A quantitative argumentation-based Automated eXplainable Decision System for fake news detection on social media,"Chi, HX; Liao, BS","Social media is flooded with rumors, which make fake news detection a pressing problem. Many black box approaches have been proposed to automatically predict the veracity of claims. These methods are lack of interpretability. Thus, we propose a Quantitative Argumentation-based Automated eXplainable Decision-making System (QA-AXDS) to tackle this problem and provide users with explanations about the results. The system is fully data-driven in its processes, which allows our models to make greater use of data and be more automatic and scalable than other quantitative framework models. In terms of interpretability, the system can automatically acquire human-level knowledge, and interact with users in the form of dialog trees through explanatory models, thus helping them understand the internal reasoning process of the system. The experimental results show that our system has better transparency and interpretability than other approaches based on the pure machine learning methods, and performs competitively in accuracy among others. In addition, the explanation model provides a way to improve the algorithms when some problems are identified by checking the explanations. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V.

What the Metaverse Is (Really) and Why We Need to Know About It,"Riva, G; Wiederhold, BK","Major technology companies are investing significant sums of money in the creation of the metaverse whose main feature will be the fusion between the virtual world and the physical world. To allow this possibility is one of the less obvious features of the metaverse: the metaverse works like our minds. This ability makes the metaverse a significantly different technology from its predecessors. If television and social media are persuasive technologies, because of their ability to influence people's attitudes and behaviors, the metaverse is instead a transformative technology, capable of modifying what people think reality is. To achieve this goal, the technologies of the metaverse hack different key cognitive mechanisms: the experience of being in a place and in a body, the processes of brain-to-brain attunement and synchrony, and the ability of experiencing and inducing emotions.

The Post-advertising Condition. A Socio-Semiotic and Semio-Pragmatic Approach to Algorithmic Capitalism,"Eugeni, R","The primary hypothesis of this paper is that recent years have seen a shift from digital advertising to post-advertising: thanks to the growing role of machine learning algorithms in communicational processes, advertising has been losing the character of explicitly persuasive addresses to assume that of friendly and open proposals and advice, or even the simple facilitation of everyday purchasing practices. The paper seeks to understand if and under what conditions the socio-semiotic and semio-pragmatic approaches developed in relation to traditional advertising can still be applied to post-advertising phenomena. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first one, the advent of the post-advertising condition is considered. In the second one, Amazon's Alexa, an example of a post-advertising dispositive, is analyzed.

This research follows the foundations of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and examines how cognitive and peripheral cues impact experiential dimensions, leading to chatbot user recommendation intentions. The study introduced warmth and competence as mediating variables in both the purchase and postpurchase stages, utilizing a robust explanatory sequential mixed-method research design. The researchers tested and validated the proposed conceptual model using a 3 x 3 factorial design, collecting 354 responses in the purchase stage and 286 responses in the postpurchase stage. In the second stage, they conducted in-depth qualitative interviews (Study 2) to gain further insights into the validity of the experimental research (Study 1). The results obtained from Study 1 revealed that ""cognitive cues"" and ""competence"" significantly influence recommendation intentions among chatbot users. On the other hand, ""peripheral cues"" and warmth significantly contribute to positive experiences encountered during the purchase stage. The researchers further identified 69 thematic codes through exploratory research, providing a deeper understanding of the variables.

The main remarkable characteristics of that model can be the high level of abstraction of the model, the flexibility to adjunction, suppression and substitution, the graphical simple representation, and the tolerance to errors which can occur during knowledge acquisition.",2002,,"6TH WORLD MULTICONFERENCE ON SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS, VOL XIII, PROCEEDINGS: CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS OF SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS III",,,324-329,WOS:000179458900059,,,#7308,Ahmed 2002,,,0
A Smart Ad Display System,"Xiao, L; Wu, DJ; Ding, M","This paper proposes a smart ad display system to provide personalized delivery of video ads. The proposed system records consumers' facial expression and eye gaze stream data as they watch an ad and analyzes data at the frame level. The recognized facial expression and detected eye gaze are matched to the corresponding frame of the video ad, thereby linking facial expressions to specific visual objects appearing in the ad. By tracking a consumer's facial expressions in response to various visual objects in real time, the system learns the consumer's individual preferences toward different ads, searches the ad pool, and selects and subsequently displays a new ad that is most likely to elicit positive attitudinal and behavioral responses. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system with two empirical studies. The results show that by tracking a consumer's facial responses to only one ad or even part of an ad, our proposed system is able to make reasonably accurate inferences about a consumer's ad preferences, with or without using information about other consumers. These inferences are used to make personalized recommendations that help enhance consumers' ad viewing experiences and elicit favorable responses.",2024,,INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH,35,4,1873-1889,WOS:001160686400001,10.1287/isre.2020.0128,,#7313,Xiao 2024,,,0
CoQuiAAS: A Constraint-based Quick Abstract Argumentation Solver,"IEEE; Lagniez, JM; Lonca, E; Mailly, JG","Nowadays, argumentation is a salient keyword in artificial intelligence. The use of argumentation techniques is particularly convenient for thematics such that multiagent systems, where it allows to describe dialog protocols (using persuasion, negotiation,...) or on-line discussion analysis; it also allows to handle queries where a single agent has to reason with conflicting information (inference in the presence of inconsistency, inconsistency measure). This very rich framework gives numerous reasoning tools, thanks to several acceptability semantics and inference policies.On the other hand, the progress of SAT solvers in the recent years, and more generally the progress on Constraint Programming paradigms, lead to some powerful approaches that permit to tackle theoretically hard problems.The needs of efficient applications to solve the usual reasoning tasks in argumentation, together with the capabilities of modern Constraint Programming solvers, lead us to study the encoding of usual acceptability semantics into logical settings. We propose diverse use of Constraint Programming techniques to develop a software library dedicated to argumentative reasoning. We present a library which offers the advantages to be generic and easily adaptable. We finally describe an experimental study of our approach for a set of semantics and inference tasks, and we describe the behaviour of our solver during the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation.",2015,,2015 IEEE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI 2015),,,928-935,WOS:000374592500120,10.1109/ICTAI.2015.134,,#7317,IEEE 2015,,,0
A Survey on Ambient Intelligence in Healthcare,"Acampora, G; Cook, DJ; Rashidi, P; Vasilakos, AV","Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions).

Affective TV: Concepts of Affective Computing Applied to Digital Television,"Valentim, P; Muchaluat-Saade, D","The traditional broadcast TV viewing experience has barely evolved since its inception, remaining mostly static despite many technical advances. Smart TVs show attempts of filling this gap, but present challenges, such as limiting functionalities to specific models and lack of standardization. Privacy concerns arise as smart TVs connect to advertising and monitoring services. In the spectrum of interactivity, an option that stands out is affective computing, an interdisciplinary field that seeks to develop systems capable of recognizing, expressing and responding to human emotions. This work proposes the incorporation of affective computing techniques and concepts to improve the experience and interactivity with digital TV, naming it ""Affective TV"". The work presents a modular architecture, recognition modules developed for multiple modes of interaction and a fully operational implementation of the architecture, developed for the standard digital TV middleware in Brazil, Ginga. Affective TV uses audio and video capturing devices and allows users to set up their environments. Recognition modules capture and classify data, communicating directly to the TV middleware. Proof-of-concept applications, incorporating voice and hand pose interactions with facial expression recognition, were evaluated using the GQM. UEQ-S and TAM questionnaires were employed. Very positive results were obtained, including an excellent UEQ rating, showcasing technical feasibility, attractiveness, user experience, perceived usefulness, and ease of use.

Risk and Exposure of XAI in Persuasion and Argumentation: The case of Manipulation,"Carli, R; Najjar, A; Calvaresi, D","In the last decades, Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly adopted in assistive (possibly collaborative) decision-making tools. In particular, AI-based persuasive technologies are designed to steer/influence users' behaviour, habits, and choices to facilitate the achievement of their own - predetermined - goals. Nowadays, the inputs received by the assistive systems leverage heavily AI data-driven approaches. Thus, it is imperative to have transparent and understandable (to the user) both the process leading to the recommendations and the recommendations. The Explainable AI (XAI) community has progressively contributed to ""opening the black box"" , ensuring the interaction's effectiveness, and pursuing the safety of the individuals involved. However, principles and methods ensuring the efficacy and information retain on the human have not been introduced yet. The risk is to underestimate the context dependency and subjectivity of the explanations' understanding, interpretation, and relevance. Moreover, even a plausible (and possibly expected) explanation can lead to an imprecise or incorrect outcome or its understanding. This can lead to unbalanced and unfair circumstances, such as giving a financial advantage to the system owner/provider and the detriment of the user.This paper highlights that the sole explanations - especially in the context of persuasive technologies - are not self-sufficient to protect users' psychological and physical integrity. Conversely, explanations could be misused, becoming themselves a tool of manipulation. Therefore, we suggest characteristics safeguarding the explanation from being manipulative and legal principles to be used as criteria for evaluating the operation of XAI systems, both from an ex-ante and ex-post perspective.",2022,,"EXPLAINABLE AND TRANSPARENT AI AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS, EXTRAAMAS 2022",13283,,204-220,WOS:000870042100013,10.1007/978-3-031-15565-9_13,,#7351,Carli 2022,,,0
Digital transformation and pollution emission of enterprises: Evidence from China's micro-enterprises,"Li, GQ; Jin, YP; Gao, X","Based on pollution emission data and digital product import data of Chinese industrial enterprises from 2000 to 2013, this paper takes enterprise digital imported products as a natural experiment to build a model of multiple phase difference in difference (DID) to investigate the pollution reduction effect of enterprise digital transformation. The research results show that the digital transformation of enterprises can significantly reduce their pollution emissions. The strong persuasive and robustness of the model results are verified by substituting variables, eliminating interference value, excluding other factors, time lag effect and factor sensitivity analysis. When the overall digital transformation level of non-polluting enterprises in the city where polluting enterprises are located is used as an instrumental variable to deal with the potential endogeneity problem, the results still hold. Due to the relatively high level of environmental regulation in the eastern region, the central and western regions undertake low-end manufacturing industries and have limited economic development. So, the environmental governance effect of enterprises in the eastern region is more significant than that in the central and western regions. The strong agglomeration in coastal areas makes the emission reduction effect more significant. The environmental governance effect of enterprise digitization is mainly reflected in foreign capital, collective and large and medium-sized enterprises. Enterprise digitization and technological innovation jointly promote the pollution reduction of enterprises, and enterprise digitization transformation only has the ""end treatment""effect.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

"Influencer Marketing, Narrative Transportation, and Consumer Well-Being: An Exploration of How Virtual Influencers Impact Followers' Well-Being","Jain, R; Schuster, L; Luck, E; Jin, HS","With recent advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence and computer-generated imagery, virtual influencers (VIs) have become prominent branding tools that command high engagement rates. Most extant research explores the marketing outcomes of using VIs in brand campaigns. However, little is known about how interacting with VIs on social media platforms may affect consumers' well-being. This research takes a comprehensive approach, developing a nuanced understanding of whether (and how) human-like VIs (HVIs) impact consumers' well-being. We employ a conceptual development approach drawing on scholarship from influencer marketing, narrative transportation, and consumer well-being and gather additional support for the conceptual framework from data collected by interviewing 25 followers of HVIs. The conceptual framework proposes that when interacting with influencers' social media posts, followers experience narrative transportation, which positively influences followers' hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. However, the conceptual framework also proposes that these relationships are moderated by the type of influencer (human vs. virtual) sharing the post. Specifically, we suggest that interactions with HVIs provide followers with enjoyment (hedonic well-being) and support their self-acceptance, personal growth, relationships, and autonomy (eudaimonic well-being). We also provide initial evidence of the favorable marketing outcomes of enhanced well-being from engagement with HVIs, including contemplation of brand purchase. The study thus advances extant VI literature by proposing a theoretically and empirically informed conceptual model that examines HVIs' influence on consumer well-being. Also, it contributes to addressing the broader calls for research on the impact of social media and influencer marketing on consumer well-being.",2024,,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES,48,6,,WOS:001368942100001,10.1111/ijcs.13105,,#7362,Jain 2024,,,0
Framing photos in the digital dark age: towards a socio-technological 'ecology of images',"Caldwell, S; Gedeon, T","The binary question of photography as science or art has been raging since Daguerre invented silver halide photography in 1839. Never has this controversy been more crucial, or been raised to such a fever pitch as in today's socio-technological world, in which uncertain images are consumed like candy and the evidentiary status of photographs is precarious at best. The 'offline' society of last century is behind us, where a philosopher like Sontag could confidently state that ""a photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that something exists, or did exist, which is like what's in the picture"" [1]. The 'ecology of images' of which she spoke is urgently needed now if we are to establish a framework within which the daily onslaught of uncertain imagery can be understood, the invidious action of image-based partisan persuasion can be combatted, pioneering achievements in image artistry can be celebrated, and a reliable photographic record of our current and future real world can be preserved.We may be better positioned now than at any time in the past to attempt such a task. Imaging technologies (ubiquitous digital photography, sophisticated camera sensors, image editing, synthetic image generation) have brought to fruition the use of photographic images to expand into a wide range of 'ecological' niches with varying impacts on individuals and societies. Other technologies (physiological signal processing, artificial intelligence), provide us with the means to gain insight into human perspectives and conscious/subliminal perceptions of these images. The contexts that apply to image distribution (digital platforms, social engineering, governmental regulation, communities of interest, commercial interests) are daily news. Early attempts to address image integrity (authenticity initiatives, fact-checking organisations) highlight the desire of humans to illuminate the age in which we find ourselves, a 'digital dark ages' [2] of eroding authenticity of our traditional knowledge artefacts.Drawing together reflections on the role of images in our century as well as a range of investigations over several years into aspects of the human-image nexus, we outline some of the technological and social features of a potential 'ecology of images' that may help shine light on the panoply of images of our times.",2021,,APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING XLIV,11842,,,WOS:000759326900020,10.1117/12.2598440,,#7377,Caldwell 2021,,,0
The University as an Augmentation of Aesthetic Experience: In Defense of the Printed Book,"Petrenko, VV","The article discusses the difficult question of whether the Book will lose its significance in the era of universal digitalization and artificial intelligence. The article considers the prospects for interpreting the Book as a special material entity responsible for establishing social ties within the university community, in the logic of object-oriented ontology. Being a visual - victorious - cultural and material form of Modernism, the Book has long been in the status of a truly authorial principle and embodied the very spirit of the Enlightenment and freedom of one's own inalienable statement. The Book has always been on the side of positive social forces. The question that remains open in the era of media, social networks and digital gadgets: will the Book be able to retain the place in the institutional breakdown of the social field, which it held quite firmly and for quite a long time? The article presents the central conceptually loaded concepts in a single discursive context, reflecting the choice of a common thematic horizon - ""University"", ""university community"", ""aesthetic experience"", ""library/ Book"". As a result, we come to the following conclusions: 1) Methodologically, the concept of the University (university community) can be conceptualized in the same way as social and cultural anthropology in general, no matter what it addresses. 2) Already in this formulation of the question, one of the constitutive concepts, largely fulfilling the function of the supporting structure, is designated - the concept of ""community"". The article shows that it is worth taking into account the material component of those partly ethnomethodological, partly habitual dispositions and the corresponding theoretical optics. It is in them that the ""university community"" expresses itself in the expected way as a collective identity. Removing the ""natural attitude"" and making the Book a mandatory condition for the existence of a horizontal network structure in the person of the university community, we gain additional access to the codification of the codes of the habitual order (P. Bourdieu). They are associated with the features of the organization, functioning, ""capitalization"" and the final institutionalization of this community. By exploring horizontal network structures of any level and degree of generality, we can return to them that focus of aesthetically presented authenticity and persuasiveness that is often lost in the abstract mode of thinking that is familiar to philosophy.",2024,,TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL,,509,76-80,WOS:001443823400007,10.17223/15617793/509/7,,#7380,Petrenko 2024,,,0
Digital Health Education for the Future: The SaNuRN (Santé Numérique Rouen-Nice) Consortium's Journey,"Grosjean, J; Dufour, F; Benis, A; Januel, JM; Staccini, P; Darmoni, SJ","Sant & eacute; Num & eacute;rique Rouen -Nice (SaNuRN; ""Digital Health Rouen -Nice"" in English) is a 5 -year project by the University of Rouen Normandy (URN) and C & ocirc;te d'Azur University (CAU) consortium to optimize digital health education for medical and paramedical students, professionals, and administrators. The project includes a skills framework, training modules, and teaching resources. In 2027, SaNuRN is expected to train a significant portion of the 400,000 health and paramedical students at the French national level. Our purpose is to give a synopsis of the SaNuRN initiative, emphasizing its novel educational methods and how they will enhance the delivery of digital health education. Our goals include showcasing SaNuRN as a comprehensive program consisting of a proficiency framework, instructional modules, and educational materials and explaining how SaNuRN is implemented in the participating academic institutions. SaNuRN is aimed at educating and training health and paramedical students in digital health. The project is a cooperative effort between URN and CAU, covering 4 French departments. It is based on the French National Referential on Digital Health ( FNRDH ), which defines the skills and competencies to be acquired and validated by every student in the health, paramedical, and social professions curricula. The SaNuRN team is currently adapting the existing URN and CAU syllabi to FNRDH and developing short -duration video capsules of 20-30 minutes to teach all the relevant material. The project aims to ensure that the largest student population earns the necessary skills, and it has developed a 2 -tier system involving facilitators who will enable the efficient expansion of the project's educational outreach and support the students in learning the needed material efficiently. With a focus on real -world scenarios and innovative teaching activities integrating telemedicine devices and virtual professionals, SaNuRN is committed to enabling continuous learning for health care professionals in clinical practice. The SaNuRN team introduced new ways of evaluating health care professionals by shifting from a knowledge -based to a competencies -based evaluation, aligning with the Miller teaching pyramid and using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination and Script Concordance Test in digital health education. Drawing on the expertise of URN, CAU, and their public health and digital research laboratories and partners, SaNuRN represents a platform for continuous innovation, including telemedicine training and living labs with virtual and interactive professional activities. SaNuRN provides a comprehensive, personalized, 30 -hour training package for health and paramedical students, addressing all 70 FNRDH competencies. The project is enhanced using artificial intelligence and natural language processing to create virtual patients and professionals for digital health care simulation. SaNuRN teaching materials are open access. It collaborates with academic institutions worldwide to develop educational material on digital health in English and multilingual formats. SaNuRN offers a practical and persuasive training approach to meet the current digital health education requirements.",2024,,JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION,10,,,WOS:001240906000001,10.2196/53997,,#7397,Grosjean 2024,,,0
A Diabetes Education App for People Living With Type 2 Diabetes: Co-Design Study,"Pienkowska, A; Ang, CS; Mammadova, M; Mahadzir, MDA; Car, J","Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing global health concern, including in Singapore. Diabetes education programs have been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes and diabetes self-management skills. Mobile health apps have emerged as useful tools for diabetes education; however, their use and acceptance by the target population remain inconsistent. Therefore, end-user participation in the design and development of a mobile health app is crucial for designing an acceptable app that can improve outcomes for populations with a chronic disease.Objective: The objective of this study was to apply an end-user participatory approach to co-design a diabetes education app prototype for people living with T2D by exploring their perceptions, acceptance, and usability of an app prototype, as well as their diabetes experience and perspectives on digital diabetes education. Methods: A total of 8 people with T2D, who were recruited from diabetes management Facebook groups, participated in 4 web-based surveys via Qualtrics and 2 structured interviews via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) between August 20, 2021, and January 28, 2022. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses of the discussion and iterative feedback on the app prototype were used to assess the participants' perceptions of living with T2D, attitudes toward digital diabetes education, and acceptance of the prototype. Results: Analyses of the surveys and interview data revealed 3 themes: challenges of living with T2D; validation, acceptability, and usability of the diabetes education app prototype; and perspectives on digital diabetes education. In the first theme, participants highlighted the importance of solitary accountability, translating knowledge into practice, and developing pragmatic self-consciousness. The second theme indicated that the diabetes education app prototype was acceptable, with information and appearance being key; revealed ambivalent and polarized opinions toward the chatbot; and confirmed potential impact of the app on diabetes self-management skills and practice. The third theme comprised the necessity of using a variety of information-seeking strategies and recommendations for desired content and app qualities, including accessibility, adaptability, autonomy, evidence-based design and content, gamification, guidance, integration, personalization, and up-to-date content. The findings were used to reiterate the app design.Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, the study demonstrated the feasibility of engaging and empowering people living with T2D to consider digital therapeutics for diabetes self-management skills and practice. Participants gave rather positive feedback on the design and content of the app prototype, with some recommendations for improvements. The findings suggest that incorporating end-user feedback into app design can lead to the creation of feasible and acceptable tools for diabetes education, potentially improving outcomes for populations with a chronic disease. Further research is needed to test the impact of the refined diabetes education app prototype on diabetes self-management skills and practice and quality of life.",2023,,JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH,7,,,WOS:001072257600002,10.2196/45490,,#7399,Pienkowska 2023,,,0
Effects of interaction between brand positioning and chatbot conversational style on perceived fit and brand attitudes,"Cheng, LK; Toung, CL","Although an underdog brand positioning can elicit positive consumer responses, maintaining a brand's positioning requires maintaining consistent brand associations. If the associations created by the company's service providers do not align with the brand's positioning, this discrepancy can lead to consumer confusion or to a decline in brand attitudes. Chatbots, as customer-facing representatives, play a crucial role in how consumers perceive and evaluate a brand. However, the role of chatbots in shaping brand attitude has not been extensively studied. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of chatbot conversational styles on consumers' perceptions of the fit between a brand's positioning and its messaging, focusing on both ""top-dog"" and ""underdog"" brands. This study demonstrates that underdog brands using chatbots with warm conversational styles and top-dog brands using chatbots with competent (i.e., professional) conversational styles foster positive brand evaluations by consumers through perceived fit. Additionally, this study introduces the concept of power state-an individual's degree of perceived control over their surroundings-as a moderator in human-chatbot interactions, demonstrating that high-power-state consumers of top-dog brands favor a competent conversational style, whereas low-power-state consumers favor a warm conversational style regardless of the brand's positioning.",2024,,PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING,41,6,1383-1395,WOS:001166309600001,10.1002/mar.21986,,#7407,Cheng 2024,,,0

"""See the Image in Different Contexts"": Using Reverse Image Search to Support the Identification of Fake News in Instagram-Like Social Media","Aprin, F; Chounta, IA; Hoppe, HU","Social media are an integral part of the daily lives of today's young generation. In addition to the positive impact on learning through these channels, there are also risks related to toxic content like ""fake news"" on various social media. Fake news aims to change opinions based on disinformation or misinformation supporting conspiracy theories, e.g., related to the pandemic. Fake news creators use various multimedia artifacts, including images taken from serious and valid news sources, to attract the audience's attention. Tracking images in different contexts can give social media users important clues to distinguish fake news from credible information. We report on the development of a web-based learning environment that includes a ""virtual learning companion"" to help learners improve their understanding, awareness, and critical thinking concerning such social media threats. The learning environment mimics Instagram and includes toxic and nontoxic content in a controlled way. The companion is implemented as a browser plugin that communicates with students via chat. The companion poses knowledge activation questions and answers according to an underlying script. The companion offers other sources with the same image identified through Reverse Image Search (RIS). The goal is to help learners find the same image in different contexts with different textual descriptions and keywords. For this purpose, we added basic NLP mechanisms to extract keywords from these contexts, including keywords that signal persuasiveness. Currently, we evaluate the impact of this tool and the provided support in distinguishing fake or credible news.",2022,,"INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS, ITS 2022",13284,,264-275,WOS:000874464200025,10.1007/978-3-031-09680-8_25,,#7422,Aprin 2022,,,0
Persuasive Design for Healthy Eating: A Scoping Review,"Liu, XY; Ren, XP; Pan, SB","In this scoping review, we aimed to summarize and analyze the latest research developments of persuasive design for healthy eating behavior and explore future design opportunities.

Based on a selection process, 28 papers that mainly focused on addressing dietary health by persuasive designs were eventually included in final analysis. These 28 papers were sorted by three characteristics: research specifications, methodologies, and design rationales. Our data analyses revealed that the reviewed papers primarily utilized persuasive technologies for eating behaviors monitoring, recording, and healthy eating suggestion. Moreover, six types of design applications were commonly implemented, including mobile applications, persuasive messages, digital products and service systems, wearable devices, chatbots/assistants, and public devices. Our review showed that persuasive design, as a generic approach for promoting healthy eating, lacked research investigations on personalized solutions for particular user groups such as office workers and teenagers. Future works could explore persuasive design strategies by applying the research factors of user experience and examining the efficacy of persuasive technology tools to effectively promote healthy eating behaviors for various user groups in different contexts.",2022,,"DISTRIBUTED, AMBIENT AND PERVASIVE INTERACTIONS: SMART LIVING, LEARNING, WELL-BEING AND HEALTH, ART AND CREATIVITY, PT II",13326,,292-303,WOS:000870090500020,10.1007/978-3-031-05431-0_20,,#7423,Liu 2022,,,0

Capability-Based Scaling Laws for LLM Red-Teaming,"Panfilov, A.; Kassianik, P.; Andriushchenko, M.; Geiping, J.","As large language models grow in capability and agency, identifying vulnerabilities through red-teaming becomes vital for safe deployment. However, traditional prompt-engineering approaches may prove ineffective once red-teaming turns into a weak-to-strong problem, where target models surpass red-teamers in capabilities. To study this shift, we frame red-teaming through the lens of the capability gap between attacker and target. We evaluate more than 500 attacker-target pairs using LLM-based jailbreak attacks that mimic human red-teamers across diverse families, sizes, and capability levels. Three strong trends emerge: (i) more capable models are better attackers, (ii) attack success drops sharply once the target’s capability exceeds the attacker’s, and (iii) attack success rates correlate with high performance on social science splits of the MMLU-Pro benchmark. From these trends, we derive a jailbreaking scaling law that predicts attack success for a fixed target based on attacker-target capability gap. These findings suggest that fixed-capability attackers (e.g., humans) may become ineffective against future models, increasingly capable open-source models amplify risks for existing systems, and model providers must accurately measure and control models’ persuasive and manipulative abilities to limit their effectiveness as attackers.",2025,,,,,,,,1,#7435,Panfilov 2025,,,0
Planning without Search: Refining Frontier LLMs with Offline Goal-Conditioned RL,"Hong, J.; Dragan, A.; Levine, S.","Large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks like question answering and dialogue, but complex tasks requiring interaction, such as negotiation and persuasion, require additional long-horizon reasoning and planning. Reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning can enable such planning in principle, but suffers from drawbacks that hinder scalability. In particular, multi-turn RL training incurs high memory and computational costs, which are exacerbated when training LLMs as policies. Furthermore, the largest LLMs do not expose the APIs necessary to be trained in such manner. As a result, modern methods to improve the reasoning of LLMs rely on sophisticated prompting mechanisms rather than RL fine-tuning. To remedy this, we propose a novel approach that uses goal-conditioned value functions to guide the reasoning of LLM agents, that scales even to large API-based models. These value functions predict how a task will unfold given an action, allowing the LLM agent to evaluate multiple possible outcomes, both positive and negative, to plan effectively. In addition, these value functions are trained over reasoning steps rather than full actions, to be a concise and light-weight module that facilitates decision-making in multi-turn interactions. We validate our method on tasks requiring interaction, including tool use, social deduction, and dialogue, demonstrating superior performance over both RL fine-tuning and prompting methods while maintaining efficiency and scalability. 1",2025,,,,,,,,2,#7436,Hong 2025,,,0
Detection and Mitigation of Hallucination in Large Reasoning Models: A Mechanistic Perspective,"Sun, Z.; Wang, Q.; Wang, H.; Zhang, X.; Xu, J.","Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive capabilities in multi-step reasoning tasks. However, alongside these successes, a more deceptive form of model error has emerged—Reasoning Hallucination—where logically coherent but factually incorrect reasoning traces lead to persuasive yet faulty conclusions. Unlike traditional hallucinations, these errors are embedded within structured reasoning, making them more difficult to detect and potentially more harmful. In this work, we investigate reasoning hallucinations from a mechanistic perspective. We propose the Reasoning Score, which quantifies the depth of reasoning by measuring the divergence between logits obtained from projecting late layers of LRMs to the vocabulary space, effectively distinguishing shallow pattern-matching from genuine deep reasoning. Using this score, we conduct an in-depth analysis on the ReTruthQA dataset and identify two key reasoning hallucination patterns: early-stage fluctuation in reasoning depth and incorrect backtracking to flawed prior steps. These insights motivate our Reasoning Hallucination Detection (RHD) framework, which achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. To mitigate reasoning hallucinations, we further introduce GRPO-R, an enhanced reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates step-level deep reasoning rewards via potential-based shaping. Our theoretical analysis establishes stronger generalization guarantees, and experiments demonstrate improved reasoning quality and reduced hallucination rates.",2025,,,,,,,,4,#7438,Sun 2025,,,0
Persuasion and Safety in the Era of Generative AI,"Kong, H.","As large language models (LLMs) achieve advanced persuasive capabilities, concerns about their potential risks have grown. The EU AI Act prohibits AI systems that use manipulative or deceptive techniques to undermine informed decision-making, highlighting the need to distinguish between rational persuasion, which engages reason, and manipulation, which exploits cognitive biases. My dissertation addresses the lack of empirical studies in this area by developing a taxonomy of persuasive techniques, creating a human-annotated dataset, and evaluating LLMs’ ability to distinguish between these methods. This work contributes to AI safety by providing resources to mitigate the risks of persuasive AI and fostering discussions on ethical persuasion in the age of generative AI.",2025,,,,,,,,5,#7439,Kong 2025,,,0
Ethics and Persuasion in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback: A Procedural Rhetorical Approach,"Lodoen, S.; Orchard, A.","Since 2022, versions of generative AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Claude have been trained using a specialized technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune language model output using feedback from human annotators. As a result, the integration of RLHF has greatly enhanced the outputs of these large language models (LLMs) and made the interactions and responses appear more “human-like” than those of previous versions using only supervised learning. The increasing convergence of human and machine-written text has potentially severe ethical, sociotechnical, and pedagogical implications relating to transparency, trust, bias, and interpersonal relations. To highlight these implications, this paper presents a rhetorical analysis of some of the central procedures and processes currently being reshaped by RLHF-enhanced generative AI chatbots: upholding language conventions, information seeking practices, and expectations for social relationships. Rhetorical investigations of generative AI and LLMs have, to this point, focused largely on the persuasiveness of the content generated. Using Ian Bogost’s concept of procedural rhetoric, this paper shifts the site of rhetorical investigation from content analysis to the underlying mechanisms of persuasion built into RLHF-enhanced LLMs. In doing so, this theoretical investigation opens a new direction for further inquiry in AI ethics that considers how procedures rerouted through AI-driven technologies might reinforce hegemonic language use, perpetuate biases, decontextualize learning, and encroach upon human relationships. It will therefore be of interest to educators, researchers, scholars, and the growing number of users of generative AI chatbots.",2025,,,,,,,,6,#7440,Lodoen 2025,,,0
Must Read: A Systematic Survey of Computational Persuasion,"Bozdag, N.B.; Mehri, S.; Yang, X.; Tur, G.; Hakkani-Tür, D.","Persuasion is a fundamental aspect of communication, influencing decision-making across diverse contexts, from everyday conversations to high-stakes scenarios such as politics, marketing, and law. The rise of conversational AI systems has significantly expanded the scope of persuasion, introducing both opportunities and risks. AI-driven persuasion can be leveraged for beneficial applications, but also poses threats through manipulation and unethical influence. Moreover, AI systems are not only persuaders, but also susceptible to persuasion, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks and bias reinforcement. Despite rapid advancements in AI-generated persuasive content, our understanding of what makes persuasion effective remains limited due to its inherently subjective and context-dependent nature. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of computational persuasion, structured around three key perspectives: (1) AI as a Persuader, which explores AI-generated persuasive content and its applications; (2) AI as a Persuadee, which examines AI’s susceptibility to influence and manipulation; and (3) AI as a Persuasion Judge, which analyzes AI’s role in evaluating persuasive strategies, detecting manipulation, and ensuring ethical persuasion. We introduce a taxonomy for computational persuasion research and discuss key challenges, including evaluating persuasiveness, mitigating manipulative persuasion, and developing responsible AI-driven persuasive systems. Our survey outlines future research directions to enhance the safety, fairness, and effectiveness of AI-powered persuasion while addressing the risks posed by increasingly capable language models.",2025,,,,,,,,8,#7442,Bozdag 2025,,,0
Real-World Gaps in AI Governance Research,"Strauss, I.; Moure, I.; Reilly, T.O.; Rosenblat, S.","Drawing on 1,178 safety and reliability papers from 9,439 generative AI papers (January 2020 – March 2025), we compare research outputs of leading AI companies (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI) and AI universities (CMU, MIT, NYU, Stanford, UC Berkeley, and University of Washington). We find that corporate AI research increasingly concentrates on pre-deployment areas—model alignment and testing & evaluation—while attention to deployment-stage issues such as model bias has waned. Significant research gaps exist in high-risk deployment domains, including healthcare, finance, misinformation, persuasive and addictive features, hallucinations, and copyright. Without improved observability into deployed AI, growing corporate concentration could deepen knowledge deficits.

Algorithmic Addiction by Design: Big Tech’s Leverage of Dark Patterns to Maintain Market Dominance and its Challenge for Content Moderation,"Nie, M.","Today’s largest technology corporations, especially ones with consumer-facing products such as social media platforms, use a variety of unethical and often outright illegal tactics to maintain their dominance. One tactic that has risen to the level of the public consciousness is the concept of addictive design, evidenced by the fact that excessive social media use has become a salient problem, particularly in the mental and social development of adolescents and young adults. As tech companies have developed more and more sophisticated artificial intelligence (AI) models to power their algorithmic recommender systems, they will become more successful at their goal of ensuring addiction to their platforms. This paper explores how online platforms intentionally cultivate addictive user behaviors and the broad societal implications, including on the health and well-being of children and adolescents. It presents the usage of addictive design — including the usage of dark patterns, persuasive design elements, and recommender algorithms — as a tool leveraged by technology corporations to maintain their dominance. Lastly, it describes the challenge of content moderation to address the problem and gives an overview of solutions at the policy level to counteract addictive design.",2025,,,,,,,,11,#7445,Nie 2025,,,0
Information Retrieval in the Age of Generative AI: The RGB Model,"Garetto, M.P.; Cornacchia, A.P.; Galante, F.; Nordio, A.; Tarable, A.P.","The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI is fundamentally transforming information retrieval and processing on the Internet, bringing both great potential and significant concerns regarding content authenticity and reliability. This paper presents a novel quantitative approach to shed light on the complex information dynamics arising from the growing use of generative AI tools. Despite their significant impact on the digital ecosystem, these dynamics remain largely uncharted and poorly understood. We propose a stochastic model to characterize the generation, indexing, and dissemination of information in response to new topics. This scenario particularly challenges current LLMs, which often rely on real-time Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to overcome their static knowledge limitations. Our findings suggest that the rapid pace of generative AI adoption, combined with increasing user reliance, can outpace human verification, escalating the risk of inaccurate information proliferation across digital resources. An in-depth analysis of Stack Exchange data confirms that high-quality answers inevitably require substantial time and human effort to emerge. This underscores the considerable risks associated with generating persuasive text in response to new questions and highlights the critical need for responsible development and deployment of future generative AI tools.",2025,,,,,,,,12,#7446,Garetto 2025,,,0

LLM-based Semantic Augmentation for Harmful Content Detection,"Meguellati, E.; Zeghina, A.; Sadiq, S.; Demartini, G.","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on simple text classification tasks, frequently under zero-shot settings. However, their efficacy declines when tackling complex social media challenges such as propaganda detection, hateful meme classification, and toxicity identification. Much of the existing work has focused on using LLMs to generate synthetic training data, overlooking the potential of LLM-based text preprocessing and semantic augmentation. In this paper, we introduce an approach that prompts LLMs to clean noisy text and provide context-rich explanations, thereby enhancing training sets without substantial increases in data volume. We systematically evaluate on the SemEval 2024 multi-label Persuasive Meme dataset and further validate on the Google Jigsaw toxic comments and Facebook hateful memes datasets to assess generalizability. Our results reveal that zero-shot LLM classification underperforms on these high-context tasks compared to supervised models. In contrast, integrating LLM-based semantic augmentation yields performance on par with approaches that rely on human-annotated data, at a fraction of the cost. These findings underscore the importance of strategically incorporating LLMs into machine learning (ML) pipeline for social media classification tasks, offering broad implications for combating harmful content online.

Breaking the Shield: Vulnerabilities in Content Moderation for Multimodal Language Models,"Das, A.B.; Sakib, S.K.","Text-to-image generation models, especially with recent breakthroughs like GPT-4o’s image generation, have rapidly transformed how visual content is created and shared across domains. Their ability to produce visually compelling images from natural language prompts has made them increasingly influential in digital media. However, a growing concern is the generation of misinformation or discriminatory information (e.g., images that visually encode or propagate widely debunked or false information) often in a persuasive and authoritative format. In this paper, we demonstrate how multimodal large language model (MMLLM) based image generation systems can be prompted to produce misinformation and discriminatory content. Additionally, we formulate the problem of developing a generalizable prompt template that adversaries could exploit to bypass the system guardrails. Our hypothesis is that prompts framed with narrative context are more successful in evading safeguards than overtly harmful ones.

A biologically Inspired Trust Model for Open Multi-Agent Systems that is Resilient to Rapid Performance Fluctuations,"Lygizou, Z.; Kalles, D.","Trust management provides an alternative solution for securing open, dynamic, and distributed multi-agent systems, where conventional cryptographic methods prove to be impractical. However, existing trust models face challenges related to agent mobility, changing behaviors, and the cold start problem. To address these issues we introduced a biologically inspired trust model in which trustees assess their own capabilities and store trust data locally. This design improves mobility support, reduces communication overhead, resists disinformation, and preserves privacy. Despite these advantages, prior evaluations revealed limitations of our model in adapting to provider population changes and continuous performance fluctuations. This study proposes a novel algorithm, incorporating a self-classification mechanism for providers to detect performance drops potentially harmful for the service consumers. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm outperforms its original version and FIRE, a well-known trust and reputation model, particularly in handling dynamic trustee behavior. While FIRE remains competitive under extreme environmental changes, the proposed algorithm demonstrates greater adaptability across various conditions. In contrast to existing trust modeling research, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of our model using widely recognized trust model criteria, assessing its resilience against common trust-related attacks while identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential countermeasures. Finally, several key directions for future research are proposed.",2025,,,,,,,,18,#7452,Lygizou 2025,,,0
ZEROSUMEVAL: Scaling LLM Evaluation with Inter-Model Competition,"Khan, H.; Alyahya, H.A.; Alnumay, Y.; Bari, M.S.; Yener, B.","Evaluating the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) has traditionally relied on static benchmark datasets, human assessments, or model-based evaluations - methods that often suffer from overfitting, high costs, and biases. ZeroSumEval is a novel competition-based evaluation protocol that leverages zero-sum games to assess LLMs with dynamic benchmarks that resist saturation. ZeroSumEval encompasses a diverse suite of games, including security challenges (PyJail), classic games (Chess, Liar’s Dice, Poker), knowledge tests (MathQuiz), and persuasion challenges (Gandalf, Debate). These games are designed to evaluate a range of AI capabilities such as strategic reasoning, planning, knowledge application, and creativity. Building upon recent studies that highlight the effectiveness of game-based evaluations for LLMs, ZeroSumEval enhances these approaches by providing a standardized and extensible framework. To demonstrate this, we conduct extensive experiments with >7000 simulations across 7 games and 13 models. Our results show that while frontier models from the GPT and Claude families can play common games and answer questions, they struggle to play games that require creating novel and challenging questions. We also observe that models cannot reliably jailbreak each other and fail generally at tasks requiring creativity.

LLM Can be a Dangerous Persuader: Empirical Study of Persuasion Safety in Large Language Models,"Liu, M.; Xu, Z.; Zhang, X.; Jia, R.; Huang, L.","Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled them to approach human-level persuasion capabilities. However, such potential also raises concerns about the safety risks of LLM-driven persuasion, particularly their potential for unethical influence through manipulation, deception, exploitation of vulnerabilities, and many other harmful tactics. In this work, we present a systematic investigation of LLM persuasion safety through two critical aspects: (1) whether LLMs appropriately reject unethical persuasion tasks and avoid unethical strategies during execution, including cases where the initial persuasion goal appears ethically neutral, and (2) how influencing factors like personality traits and external pressures affect their behavior. To this end, we introduce PERSUSAFETY, the first comprehensive framework for the assessment of persuasion safety, which consists of three stages, i.e., persuasion scene creation, persuasive conversation simulation, and persuasion safety assessment. PERSUSAFETY covers 6 diverse unethical persuasion topics and 15 common unethical strategies. Through extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs, we observe significant safety concerns in most LLMs, including failing to identify harmful persuasion tasks and leveraging various unethical persuasion strategies. Our study calls for more attention to improve safety alignment in progressive and goal-driven conversations such as persuasion.",2025,,,,,,,,20,#7454,Liu 2025,,,0

Exploring the Effects of Large Language Models (Llms) on Register Variation in L2 Academic Writing: A Multidimensional Analysis of Pre- and Post-Llm-Refinement Texts,"Bu, H.","The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, in assisting academic writing have inspired considerable interest, but empirical evidence remains scarce regarding how their refinements impact the register features essential to academic discourse. This study investigates register variation in L2 academic writing before and after LLM-refinement using Biber’s (1988) Multi-Dimensional (MD) analysis framework. 200 LLM-refined L2 student essays were compared with their original human-written versions on 6 dimensions and 67 linguistic features. Results indicate that through refinement, LLMs can help improve information density and syntactic complexity, thus making the texts more closely resemble academic written discourse. However, LLM-refinement also has limitations in preserving the register and rhetorical features of academic discourse, as it increases the narrativity and decreases the persuasiveness, abstractness, technicality and formality of L2 academic writing. It overlooks the rhetorical functions of some linguistic features in the academic genre, such as the use of tense and aspect to convey generality or importance. Prompt variations exert minimal impact. Therefore, human intervention is necessary to ensure that the refined texts exhibit a more academic-like register. The findings of the present study have useful pedagogical and practical implications in English for Academic Purposes.",2025,,,,,,,,24,#7458,Bu 2025,,,0
Innovative Design and Development of Brand Visual System under the Background of Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Visual Communication Design,"Cai, Y.","Businesses that want to stand out in today's crowded marketplace must have a distinct identity for their brand. Visual branding stands out among the other aspects that make up a business's identity as a potent means of captivating consumers and communicating the essence of the brand. Visual branding, when done well, may influence customers' opinions, evoke strong feelings, and stamp themselves in their memories. Because every visual aspect of a brand—its logo, color palette, and typography—is meticulously designed to communicate the character, principles, and goals of the company. One of the most influential aspects of branding is visual identity. Brands may convey their beliefs, connect with customers on an emotional level, and differentiate themselves from competitors by using design elements like logos, colors, typography, images, and graphics. Visual branding, when done well, becomes an inherent aspect of a brand's identity and helps it to make an impact on its intended consumers. Visual branding is an effective tool for building a distinct brand identity for the company. Revolutionizing graphic design are Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools that can create visuals from natural language. But with visual persuasion, the picture is more than simply a representation; it is the message. The need to comprehend the potential applications of AI systems in the creation of visual communication gives birth to this. An investigation of grounded theory based on the opinions of experts in the key fields of visual communication led to the development of a model that this article uses to define the theoretical-methodological aspects involved in the creation of convincing visual discourses. As a result, we provide a strategy that, when followed, will lead designers through seven steps in creating convincing messages. In addition, we provide an analysis that may help with the logical and well-informed integration of stage-specific technologies, processes, and methodologies. In this study, visual communication design is implemented using ResNet101 model with Improved Artificial Bee Colony optimization model for feature selection and processing the visual and text elements in to the environment.",2025,,,,,,,,26,#7460,Cai 2025,,,0

We measure our main outcome using established psychological questionnaires based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and additionally investigate Social Costs. We find evidence that our preliminary simulations produce outcomes that are (i) consistent with theoretical expectations; and (ii) valid when compared to data from previous studies with human participants.

Locations of Characters in Narratives: Andersen and Persuasion Datasets,"Özyurt, B.; Arkhmammadova, R.; Yuret, D.","The ability of machines to grasp spatial understanding within narrative contexts is an intriguing aspect of reading comprehension that continues to be studied. Motivated by the goal to test the AI’s competence in understanding the relationship between characters and their respective locations in narratives, we introduce two new datasets: Andersen and Persuasion. For the Andersen dataset, we selected fifteen children’s stories from ""Andersen’s Fairy Tales"" by Hans Christian Andersen and manually annotated the characters and their respective locations throughout each story. Similarly, for the Persuasion dataset, characters and their locations in the novel ""Persuasion"" by Jane Austen were also manually annotated. We used these datasets to prompt Large Language Models (LLMs). The prompts are created by extracting excerpts from the stories or the novel and combining them with a question asking the location of a character mentioned in that excerpt. Out of the five LLMs we tested, the best-performing one for the Andersen dataset accurately identified the location in 61.85% of the examples, while for the Persuasion dataset, the best-performing one did so in 56.06% of the cases.",2025,,,,,,,,29,#7463,Özyurt 2025,,,0
Persuasive Calibration,"Feng, Y.; Tang, W.","We introduce and study the persuasive calibration problem, where a principal aims to provide trustworthy predictions about underlying events to a downstream agent to make desired decisions. We adopt the standard calibration framework that regulates predictions to be unbiased conditional on their own value, and thus, they can reliably be interpreted at the face value by the agent. Allowing a small calibration error budget, we aim to answer the following question: what is and how to compute the optimal predictor under this calibration error budget, especially when there exists incentive misalignment between the principal and the agent? We focus on standard ℓt-norm Expected Calibration Error (ECE) metric. We develop a general framework by viewing predictors as post-processed versions of perfectly calibrated predictors. Using this framework, we first characterize the structure of the optimal predictor. Specifically, when the principal’s utility is event-independent and for ℓ1-norm ECE, we show: (1) the optimal predictor is over-(resp. under-) confident for high (resp. low) true expected outcomes, while remaining perfectly calibrated in the middle; (2) the miscalibrated predictions exhibit a collinearity structure with the principal’s utility function. On the algorithmic side, we provide a FPTAS for computing approximately optimal predictor for general principal utility and general ℓt-norm ECE. Moreover, for the ℓ1- and ℓ∞-norm ECE, we provide polynomial-time algorithms that compute the exact optimal predictor.",2025,,,,,,,,30,#7464,Feng 2025,,,0
Off-Policy Evaluation for Sequential Persuasion Process with Unobserved Confounding,"Venkatesh, N.S.; Bang, H.; Malikopoulos, A.A.","In this paper, we expand the Bayesian persuasion framework to account for unobserved confounding variables in sender-receiver interactions. While traditional models typically assume that belief updates follow Bayesian principles, real-world scenarios often involve hidden variables that impact the receiver’s belief formation and decision-making. We conceptualize this as a sequential decision-making problem, where the sender and receiver interact over multiple rounds. In each round, the sender communicates with the receiver, who also interacts with the environment. Crucially, the receiver’s belief update is affected by an unobserved confounding variable. By reformulating this scenario as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), we capture the sender’s incomplete information regarding both the dynamics of the receiver’s beliefs and the unobserved confounder. We prove that finding an optimal observation-based policy in this POMDP is equivalent to solving for an optimal signaling strategy in the original persuasion framework. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this reformulation facilitates the application of proximal learning for off-policy evaluation (OPE) in the persuasion process. This advancement enables the sender to evaluate alternative signaling strategies using only observational data from a behavioral policy, thus eliminating the necessity for costly new experiments.",2025,,,,,,,,31,#7465,Venkatesh 2025,,,0
When Persuasion Overrides Truth in Multi-Agent LLM Debates: Introducing a Confidence-Weighted Persuasion Override Rate (CW-POR),"Agarwal, M.; Khanna, D.","In many real-world scenarios, a single Large Language Model (LLM) may encounter contradictory claims—some accurate, others forcefully incorrect—and must judge which is true. We investigate this risk in a single-turn, multi-agent debate framework: one LLM-based agent provides a factual answer from TruthfulQA, another vigorously defends a falsehood, and the same LLM architecture serves as judge. We introduce the Confidence-Weighted Persuasion Override Rate (CW-POR), which captures not only how often the judge is deceived but also how strongly it believes the incorrect choice. Our experiments on five open-source LLMs (3B–14B parameters), where we systematically vary agent verbosity (30–300 words), reveal that even smaller models can craft persuasive arguments that override truthful answers—often with high confidence.

Competitive Multi-armed Bandit Games for Resource Sharing,"Li, H.; Duan, L.","In modern resource-sharing systems, multiple agents access limited resources with unknown stochastic conditions to perform tasks. When multiple agents access the same resource (arm) simultaneously, they compete for successful usage, leading to contention and reduced rewards. This motivates our theoretical study of competitive multi-armed bandit (CMAB) games. In this paper, we study a new N-player K-arm competitive MAB game, where non-myopic players (agents) compete with each other to form diverse private estimations of unknown arms over time. Their possible collisions on the same arms and the time-varying nature of arm rewards make the policy analysis here more involved than the existing studies for myopic players. We explicitly analyze the threshold-based structures of the social optimum and the existing selfish policy, showing that the latter causes prolonged convergence times (Formula presented), while the socially optimal policy with coordinated communication reduces it to (Formula presented). Based on the policy comparison, we prove that the competition among selfish players for the best arm can result in an infinite price of anarchy (PoA), indicating an arbitrarily large efficiency loss compared to the social optimum. We further prove that no informational (non-monetary) mechanism (including Bayesian persuasion) can reduce the infinite PoA, as strategic misreporting by non-myopic players undermines such approaches. To address this, we propose a Combined Informational and Side-Payment (CISP) mechanism, which provides socially optimal arm recommendations with proper informational and monetary incentives to players according to their diverse and time-varying private beliefs. Our CISP mechanism keeps ex-post budget balanced for the social planner and ensures truthful reporting from players, thereby achieving the minimum PoA = 1 and the same convergence time as the social optimum.",2025,,,,,,,,36,#7470,Li 2025,,,0
Causal Discovery and Counterfactual Reasoning to Optimize Persuasive Dialogue Policies,"Zeng, D.; Legaspi, R.; Sun, Y.; Spirtes, P.; Zhang, K.","Tailoring persuasive conversations to users leads to more effective persuasion. However, existing dialogue systems often struggle to adapt to dynamically evolving user states. This paper presents a novel method that leverages causal discovery and counterfactual reasoning for optimizing system persuasion capability and outcomes. We employ the Greedy Relaxation of the Sparsest Permutation (GRaSP) algorithm to identify causal relationships between user and system utterance strategies, treating user strategies as states and system strategies as actions. GRaSP identifies user strategies as causal factors influencing system responses, which inform Bidirectional Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (BiCoGAN) in generating counterfactual utterances for the system. Subsequently, we use the Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (D3QN) model to utilize counterfactual data to determine the best policy for selecting system utterances. Our experiments with the PersuasionForGood dataset show measurable improvements in persuasion outcomes using our approach over baseline methods. The observed increase in cumulative rewards and Q-values highlights the effectiveness of causal discovery in enhancing counterfactual reasoning and optimizing reinforcement learning policies for online dialogue systems.",2025,,,,,,,,38,#7472,Zeng 2025,,,0

To this end, we present AgentOrca, a dual-system framework for evaluating language agents’ compliance with operational constraints and routines. Our framework encodes action constraints and routines through both natural language prompts for agents and corresponding executable code serving as ground truth for automated verification. Through an automated pipeline of test case generation and evaluation across five real-world domains, we quantitatively assess current language agents’ adherence to operational constraints. Our findings reveal notable performance gaps among state-of-the-art models, with large reasoning models like o1 demonstrating superior compliance while others show significantly lower performance, particularly when encountering complex constraints or user persuasion attempts.1",2025,,,,,,,,40,#7474,Li 2025,,,0
WritingBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Generative Writing,"Wu, Y.; Mei, J.; Yan, M.; Jin, Q.; Huang, F.","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced text generation capabilities, yet evaluating their performance in generative writing remains a challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on generic text generation or limited in writing tasks, failing to capture the diverse requirements of high-quality written contents across various domains. To bridge this gap, we present WritingBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs across 6 core writing domains and 100 subdomains, encompassing creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing. We further propose a query-dependent evaluation framework that empowers LLMs to dynamically generate instance-specific assessment criteria. This framework is complemented by a fine-tuned critic model for criteria-aware scoring, enabling evaluations in style, format and length. The framework’s validity is further demonstrated by its data curation capability, which enables 7B-parameter models to approach state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. We open-source the benchmark, along with evaluation tools and modular framework components, to advance the development of LLMs in writing.",2025,,,,,,,,43,#7477,Wu 2025,,,0
“Impressively Scary:” Exploring User Perceptions and Reactions to Unraveling Machine Learning Models in Social Media Applications,"West, J.; Cagiltay, B.; Zhang, S.; Fawaz, K.; Banerjee, S.","Machine learning models deployed locally on social media applications are used for features, such as face filters which read faces in-real time, and they expose sensitive attributes to the apps. However, the deployment of machine learning models, e.g., when, where, and how they are used, in social media applications is opaque to users. We aim to address this inconsistency and investigate how social media user perceptions and behaviors change once exposed to these models. We conducted user studies (N=21) and found that participants were unaware to both what the models output and when the models were used in Instagram and TikTok, two major social media platforms. In response to being exposed to the models’ functionality, we observed long term behavior changes in 8 participants. Our analysis uncovers the challenges and opportunities in providing transparency for machine learning models that interact with local user data.",2025,,,,,,,,45,#7479,West 2025,,,0
"AI-Powered Lawyering: AI Reasoning Models, Retrieval Augmented Generation, and the Future of Legal Practice","Schwarcz, D.; Manning, S.; Barry, P.; Prescott, J.J.; Rich, B.","Generative AI is set to transform the legal profession, but its full impact remains uncertain. While AI models like GPT-4 improve the efficiency with which legal work can be completed, they can at times make up cases and “hallucinate” facts, thereby undermining legal judgment, particularly in complex tasks handled by skilled lawyers. This article examines two emerging AI innovations that may mitigate these lingering issues: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which grounds AI-powered analysis in legal sources, and AI reasoning models, which structure complex reasoning before generating output. We conducted the first randomized controlled trial assessing these technologies, assigning upper-level law students to complete six legal tasks using a RAG-powered legal AI tool (Vincent AI), an AI reasoning model (OpenAI’s o1-preview), or no AI. We find that both AI tools significantly enhanced legal work quality, a marked contrast with previous research examining older large language models like GPT-4. Moreover, we find that these models maintain the efficiency benefits associated with use of older AI technologies. Our findings show that AI assistance significantly boosts productivity in five out of six tested legal tasks, with Vincent yielding statistically significant gains of approximately 38% to 115% and o1-preview increasing productivity by 34% to 140%, with particularly strong effects in complex tasks like drafting persuasive letters and analyzing complaints. Notably, o1-preview improved the analytical depth of participants’ work product but resulted in some hallucinations, whereas Vincent AI-aided participants produced roughly the same amount of hallucinations as participants who did not use AI at all. These findings suggest that integrating domain-specific RAG capabilities with reasoning models could yield synergistic improvements, shaping the next generation of AI-powered legal tools and the future of lawyering more generally.",2025,,,,,,,,46,#7480,Schwarcz 2025,,,0
Intolerable Risk Threshold Recommendations for Artificial Intelligence,"Raman, D.; Madkour, N.; Murphy, E.R.; Jackson, K.; Newman, J.","Frontier AI models - highly capable foundation models at the cutting edge ofAI development - may pose severe risks to public safety, human rights,economic stability, and societal value in the coming years. These risks couldarise from deliberate adversarial misuse, system failures, unintended cascadingeffects, or simultaneous failures across multiple models. In response to such risks, at the AI Seoul Summit in May 2024, 16 global AIindustry organizations signed the Frontier AI Safety Commitments, and 27nations and the EU issued a declaration on their intent to define thesethresholds. To fulfill these commitments, organizations must determine anddisclose ``thresholds at which severe risks posed by a model or system, unlessadequately mitigated, would be deemed intolerable.\'\' To assist in setting and operationalizing intolerable risk thresholds, weoutline key principles and considerations; for example, to aim for ``good, notperfect\'\' thresholds in the face of limited data on rapidly advancing AIcapabilities and consequently evolving risks.

ChatGPT for President! Presupposed content in politicians versus GPT-generated texts,"Garassino, D.; Brocca, N.; Masia, V.","This study examines ChatGPT-4’s capability to replicate linguistic strategies used in political discourse, focusing on its potential for manipulative language generation. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly popular for text generation, concerns have grown regarding their role in spreading fake news and propaganda. This research compares real political speeches with those generated by ChatGPT, with an emphasis on presuppositions—a rhetorical device that subtly influences audiences by packaging some content as already known at the moment of utterance, thus swaying opinions without explicit argumentation. Using a corpus-based pragmatic analysis, this study assesses how well ChatGPT can mimic these persuasive strategies. The findings reveal that, although ChatGPT-generated texts contain many manipulative presuppositions, key differences emerge in their frequency, form and function, compared with politicians. For instance, ChatGPT often relies on change-of-state verbs used in fixed phrases, whereas politicians rely on presupposition triggers in more varied and creative ways. Such differences, however, are challenging to detect with the “naked eye,” underscoring the potential risks posed by LLMs in political and public discourse.",2025,,,,,,,,49,#7483,Garassino 2025,,,0
Persuade Me if You Can: A Framework for Evaluating Persuasion Effectiveness and Susceptibility Among Large Language Models,"Bozdag, N.B.; Mehri, S.; Tur, G.; Hakkani-Tür, D.","Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate persuasive capabilities that rival human-level persuasion. While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs’ susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, PERSUADER agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the PERSUADEE agents, allowing us to measure LLMs’ persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B.

An Empirical Analysis of LLMs for Countering Misinformation,"Proma, A.M.; Pate, N.; Druckman, J.; He, H.; Hoque, E.","While Large Language Models (LLMs) can amplify online misinformation, they also show promise in tackling misinformation. In this paper, we empirically study the capabilities of three LLMs – ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude – in countering political misinformation. We implement a two-step, chain-of-thought prompting approach, where models first identify credible sources for a given claim and then generate persuasive responses. Our findings suggest that models struggle to ground their responses in real news sources, and tend to prefer citing left-leaning sources. We also observe varying degrees of response diversity among models. Our findings highlight concerns about using LLMs for fact-checking through only prompt-engineering, emphasizing the need for more robust guardrails.

PersuasiveToM: A Benchmark for Evaluating Machine Theory of Mind in Persuasive Dialogues,"Yu, F.; Jiang, L.; Huang, S.; Wu, Z.; Dai, X.","The ability to understand and predict the mental states of oneself and others, known as the Theory of Mind (ToM), is crucial for effective social interactions. Recent research has emerged to evaluate whether Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a form of ToM. Although recent studies have evaluated ToM in LLMs, existing benchmarks focus predominantly on physical perception with principles guided by the Sally-Anne test in synthetic stories and conversations, failing to capture the complex psychological activities of mental states in real-life social interactions. To mitigate this gap, we propose PERSUASIVETOM, a benchmark designed to evaluate the ToM abilities of LLMs in persuasive dialogues. Our framework introduces two categories of questions: (1) ToM Reasoning, assessing the capacity of LLMs to track evolving mental states (e.g., desire shifts in persuadees), and (2) ToM Application, evaluating whether LLMs can take advantage of inferred mental states to select effective persuasion strategies (e.g., emphasize rarity) and evaluate the effectiveness of persuasion strategies. Experiments across eight state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that while models excel on multiple questions, they struggle to answer questions that need tracking the dynamics and shifts of mental states and understanding the mental states in the whole dialogue comprehensively. Our aim with PERSUASIVETOM is to allow an effective evaluation of the ToM reasoning ability of LLMs with more focus on complex psychological activities.

MAPoRL2: Multi-Agent Post-Co-Training for Collaborative Large Language Models with Reinforcement Learning,"Park, C.; Han, S.; Guo, X.; Zhang, K.; Kim, J.-K.","Leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) to build collaborative multi-agentic workflows has demonstrated significant potential. However, most previous studies focus on prompting the out-of-the-box LLMs, relying on their innate capability for collaboration, which may not improve LLMs’ performance as shown recently. In this paper, we introduce a new post-training paradigm MAPoRL (Multi-Agent Post-co-training for collaborative LLMs with Reinforcement Learning), to explicitly elicit the collaborative behaviors and further unleash the power of multi-agentic LLM frameworks. In MAPoRL, multiple LLMs first generate their own responses independently and engage in a multi-turn discussion to collaboratively improve the final answer. In the end, a MAPoRL verifier evaluates both the answer and the discussion, by assigning a score that verifies the correctness of the answer, while adding incentives to encourage corrective and persuasive discussions. The score serves as the co-training reward, and is then maximized through multiagent RL. Unlike existing LLM post-training paradigms, MAPoRL advocates the co-training of multiple LLMs together using RL for better generalization. Accompanied by analytical insights, our experiments demonstrate that training individual LLMs alone is insufficient to induce effective collaboration. In contrast, multi-agent co-training can boost the collaboration performance across benchmarks, with generalization to unseen domains.",2025,,,,,,,,57,#7491,Park 2025,,,0
Are Large Language Models Good Data Preprocessors?,"Meguellati, E.; Pratama, N.; Sadiq, S.; Demartini, G.","High-quality textual training data is essential for the success of multimodal data processing tasks, yet outputs from image captioning models like BLIP and GIT often contain errors and anomalies that are difficult to rectify using rule-based methods. While recent work addressing this issue has predominantly focused on using GPT models for data preprocessing on relatively simple public datasets, there is a need to explore a broader range of Large Language Models (LLMs) and tackle more challenging and diverse datasets. In this study, we investigate the use of multiple LLMs, including LLaMA 3.1 70B, GPT-4 Turbo, and Sonnet 3.5 v2 to refine and clean the textual outputs of BLIP and GIT. We assess the impact of LLM-assisted data cleaning by comparing downstream-task (SemEval 2024 Subtask ‘Multilabel Persuasion Detection in Memes”) models trained on cleaned versus non-cleaned data. While our experimental results show improvements when using LLM-cleaned captions, statistical tests reveal that most of these improvements are not significant. This suggests that while LLMs have the potential to enhance data cleaning and repairing, their effectiveness may be limited depending on the context they are applied to and the complexity of the task and the level of noise in the text. Our findings highlight the need for further research into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in data preprocessing pipelines, especially when dealing with challenging datasets, contributing empirical evidence to the ongoing discussion about integrating LLMs into data preprocessing pipelines.",2025,,,,,,,,59,#7493,Meguellati 2025,,,0
Grounded Persuasive Language Generation for Automated Marketing,"Wu, J.; Yang, C.; Mahns, S.; Fang, F.; Xu, H.","This paper develops an agentic framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of persuasive and grounded marketing content, using real estate listing descriptions as our focal application domain.

Additionally, we introduce an explanation-enhanced LLM for both label detection and rationale-based explanation generation. Our findings indicate that the model performs comparably while also generating explanations.

Accountability in Code Review: The Role of Intrinsic Drivers and the Impact of LLMs,"Alami, A.; Jensen, V.V.; Ernst, N.A.","Accountability is an innate part of social systems. It maintains stability and ensures positive pressure on individuals’ decision-making. As actors in a social system, software developers are accountable to their team and organization for their decisions. However, the drivers of accountability and how it changes behavior in software development are less understood. In this study, we look at how the social aspects of code review affect software engineers’ sense of accountability for code quality. Since software engineering (SE) is increasingly involving Large Language Models (LLM) assistance, we also evaluate the impact on accountability when introducing LLM-assisted code reviews. We carried out a two-phased sequential qualitative study (interviews → focus groups). In Phase I (16 interviews), we sought to investigate the intrinsic drivers of software engineers influencing their sense of accountability for code quality, relying on self-reported claims. In Phase II, we tested these traits in a more natural setting by simulating traditional peer-led reviews with focus groups and then LLM-assisted review sessions. We found that there are four key intrinsic drivers of accountability for code quality: personal standards, professional integrity, pride in code quality, and maintaining one’s reputation. In a traditional peer-led review, we observed a transition from individual to collective accountability when code reviews are initiated. We also found that the introduction of LLM-assisted reviews disrupts this accountability process, challenging the reciprocity of accountability taking place in peer-led evaluations, i.e., one cannot be accountable to an LLM. Our findings imply that the introduction of AI into SE must preserve social integrity and collective accountability mechanisms.",2025,,,,,,,,62,#7496,Alami 2025,,,0
AI Models Still Lag Behind Traditional Numerical Models in Predicting Sudden-Turning Typhoons,"Xu, D.; Lu, Z.; Leung, J.C.-H.; Zhang, S.; Zhang, B.","Given the interpretability, accuracy, and stability of numerical weatherprediction (NWP) models, current operational weather forecasting relies heavilyon the NWP approach. In the past two years, the rapid development of ArtificialIntelligence (AI) has provided an alternative solution for medium-range (1-10days) weather forecasting. Bi et al. (2023) (hereafter Bi23) introduced thefirst AI-based weather prediction (AIWP) model in China, named Pangu-Weather,which offers fast prediction without compromising accuracy. In their work, Bi23made notable claims regarding its effectiveness in extreme weather predictions.However, this claim lacks persuasiveness because the extreme nature of the twotropical cyclones (TCs) examples presented in Bi23, namely Typhoon Kong-rey andTyphoon Yutu, stems primarily from their intensities rather than their movingpaths. Their claim may mislead into another meaning which is that Pangu-Weatherworks well in predicting unusual typhoon paths, which was not explicitlyanalyzed. Here, we reassess Pangu-Weather\'s ability to predict extreme TCtrajectories from 2020-2024. Results reveal that while Pangu-Weather overalloutperforms NWP models in predicting tropical cyclone (TC) tracks, it fallsshort in accurately predicting the rarely observed sudden-turning tracks, suchas Typhoon Khanun in 2023. We argue that current AIWP models still lag behindtraditional NWP models in predicting such rare extreme events in medium-rangeforecasts.",2025,,,,,,,,64,#7498,Xu 2025,,,0
A Meta-Evaluation of Style and Attribute Transfer Metrics,"Pauli, A.B.; Augenstein, I.; Assent, I.","LLMs make it easy to rewrite text in any style, be it more polite, persuasive, or more positive. We present a large-scale study of evaluation metrics for style and attribute transfer with a focus on content preservation; meaning content not attributed to the style shift is preserved. The de facto evaluation approach uses lexical or semantic similarity metrics often between source sentences and rewrites. While these metrics are not designed to distinguish between style or content differences, empirical meta-evaluation shows a reasonable correlation to human judgment. In fact, recent works find that LLMs prompted as evaluators are only comparable to semantic similarity metrics, even though intuitively, the LLM approach should better fit the task. To investigate this discrepancy, we benchmark 8 metrics for evaluating content preservation on existing datasets and additionally construct a new test set that better aligns with the meta-evaluation aim. Indeed, we then find that the empirical conclusion aligns with the intuition: content preservation metrics for style/attribute transfer must be conditional on the style shift. To support this, we propose a new efficient zero-shot evaluation method using the likelihood of the next token. We hope our meta-evaluation can foster more research on evaluating content preservation metrics, and also to ensure fair evaluation of methods for conducting style transfer.",2025,,,,,,,,65,#7499,Pauli 2025,,,0
Modeling Behavior Change for Multi-model At-Risk Students Early Prediction (extended version),"Cheng, J.; Yang, Z.-Q.; Cao, J.; Poon, K.C.F.; Lai, D.","In the educational domain, identifying students at risk of dropping out is essential for allowing educators to intervene effectively, improving both academic outcomes and overall student well-being. Data in educational settings often originate from diverse sources, such as assignments, grades, and attendance records. However, most existing research relies on online learning data and just extracting the quantitative features. While quantification eases processing, it also leads to a significant loss of original information. Moreover, current models primarily identify students with consistently poor performance through simple and discrete behavioural patterns, failing to capture the complex continuity and non-linear changes in student behaviour. We have developed an innovative prediction model, Multimodal- ChangePoint Detection (MCPD), utilizing the textual teacher remark data and numerical grade data from middle schools. Our model achieves a highly integrated and intelligent analysis by using independent encoders to process two data types, fusing the encoded feature. The model further refines its analysis by leveraging a changepoint detection module to pinpoint crucial behavioral changes, which are integrated as dynamic weights through a simple attention mechanism. Experimental validations indicate that our model achieves an accuracy range of 70- 75%, with an average outperforming baseline algorithms by approximately 5-10%. Additionally, our algorithm demonstrates a certain degree of transferability, maintaining high accuracy when adjusted and retrained with different definitions of at-risk, proving its broad applicability.",2025,,,,,,,,67,#7501,Cheng 2025,,,0
Reasoning and the Trusting Behavior of DeepSeek and GPT: An Experiment Revealing Hidden Fault Lines in Large Language Models,"Li, R.; Sedoc, J.; Sundararajan, A.","When encountering increasingly frequent performance improvements or cost reductions from a new large language model (LLM), developers of applications leveraging LLMs must decide whether to take advantage of these improvements or stay with older tried-and-tested models. Low perceived switching frictions can lead to choices that do not consider more subtle behavior changes that the transition may induce. Our experiments use a popular game-theoretic behavioral economics model of trust to show stark differences in the trusting behavior of OpenAI’s and DeepSeek’s models. We highlight a collapse in the economic trust behavior of the o1-mini and o3-mini models as they reconcile profit-maximizing and risk-seeking with future returns from trust, and contrast it with DeepSeek’s more sophisticated and profitable trusting behavior that stems from an ability to incorporate deeper concepts like forward planning and theory-of-mind. As LLMs form the basis for high-stakes commercial systems, our results highlight the perils of relying on LLM performance benchmarks that are too narrowly defined and suggest that careful analysis of their hidden fault lines should be part of any organization’s AI strategy.",2025,,,,,,,,68,#7502,Li 2025,,,0
"Sleepless Nights, Sugary Days: Creating Synthetic Users with Health Conditions for Realistic Coaching Agent Interactions","Yun, T.; Yang, E.; Safdari, M.; Gretton, A.; Matarić, M.","We present an end-to-end framework for generating synthetic users for evaluating interactive agents designed to encourage positive behavior changes, such as in health and lifestyle coaching. The synthetic users are grounded in health and lifestyle conditions, specifically sleep and diabetes management in this study, to ensure realistic interactions with the health coaching agent. Synthetic users are created in two stages: first, structured data are generated grounded in real-world health and lifestyle factors in addition to basic demographics and behavioral attributes; second, full profiles of the synthetic users are developed conditioned on the structured data. Interactions between synthetic users and the coaching agent are simulated using generative agent-based models such as Concordia, or directly by prompting a language model. Using two independently-developed agents for sleep and diabetes coaching as case studies, the validity of this framework is demonstrated by analyzing the coaching agent’s understanding of the synthetic users’ needs and challenges. Finally, through multiple blinded evaluations of user-coach interactions by human experts, we demonstrate that our synthetic users with health and behavioral attributes more accurately portray real human users with the same attributes, compared to generic synthetic users not grounded in such attributes.

We obtain these debates as concrete instances of Free Argumentative eXchanges (FAXs), a novel argumentation-based multi-agent framework allowing agents to internalise opinions by other agents differently than originally stated. We define two metrics (consensus and persuasion rate) to assess the usefulness of FAXs as argumentative explanations for image classifiers.

This requires extracting logical forms of proposed agreements in player communications and computing the relative rewards of the proposal using agents’ value functions. Combined with text-based features, this can improve our deception detection.

CCJA: Context-Coherent Jailbreak Attack for Aligned Large Language Models,"Zhou, G.; Qiu, P.; Fan, M.; Zhang, X.; Zhou, J.","Despite explicit alignment efforts for large language models (LLMs), they can still be exploited to trigger unintended behaviors, a phenomenon known as ""jailbreaking."" Current jailbreak attack methods mainly focus on discrete prompt manipulations targeting closed-source LLMs, relying on manually crafted prompt templates and persuasion rules. However, as the capabilities of open-source LLMs improve, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly crucial. In such an environment, the accessibility of model parameters and gradient information by potential attackers exacerbates the severity of jailbreak threats. To address this research gap, we propose a novel Context-Coherent Jailbreak Attack (CCJA). We define jailbreak attacks as an optimization problem within the embedding space of masked language models. Through combinatorial optimization, we effectively balance the jailbreak attack success rate with semantic coherence. Extensive evaluations show that our method not only maintains semantic consistency but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in attack effectiveness. Additionally, by integrating semantically coherent jailbreak prompts generated by our method into widely used black-box methodologies, we observe a notable enhancement in their success rates when targeting closed-source commercial LLMs. This highlights the security threat posed by open-source LLMs to commercial counterparts. We will open-source our code if the paper is accepted.",2025,,,,,,,,73,#7507,Zhou 2025,,,0
Mixture of Tunable Experts - Behavior Modification of DeepSeek-R1 at Inference Time,"Dahlke, R.; Klagges, H.; Zecha, D.; Rohr, S.; Klemm, F.","We present the Mixture-of-Tunable-Experts (MoTE), a method that extends the Mixture-of-Experts architecture of Large Language Models (LLMs). Without additional training, MoTE enables meaningful and focused behavior changes in LLMs on-the-fly during inference time. By analyzing the digital LLM brain of DeepSeek-R1 using a technique we dub “functional Token Resonance Imaging” (fTRI) – inspired by fMRI and using prompts designed to elicit specific behavior (e.g., “What happened {time}{place}?”) – we empirically identify distinctive experts associated with behaviors like refusal responses. Using MoTE we are able to intervene and control such specific behavior. We switched off the top 10 most refusal-relevant experts (0.07% of R1’s 14,848 routed experts), achieving a 52% refusal reduction on sensitive reference prompts without performance degradation on MT-Bench. Random expert deactivation resulted in smaller behavioral shifts with increased noise, whereas forced expert activation led to significantly higher refusal rates. With MoTE we were also able to successfully switch the model’s chain-of-thought reasoning language from English to Chinese in 10% of our test prompts. Our approach shares similarities with sparse autoencoders (SAEs) in terms of explainability and steerability. Unlike SAEs, MoTE does not require large training efforts, as within MoEs with a vast number of experts, specialization already emerged naturally during pretraining. Our findings suggest that significant functional mechanisms in Mixture-of-Experts architectures can at least partially be localized in a small number of specific experts, rather than being distributed throughout the model’s weights. Expert subgroups can be tuned to trigger significant behavior variations, providing insights into the inner workings of LLMs.",2025,,,,,,,,74,#7508,Dahlke 2025,,,0

This saying fits with the way large language models (LLMs) are trained, which, instead of being rewarded for correctness, are increasingly rewarded for pleasing the recipient. So, they are increasingly effective at persuading us that their answers are valuable. But what tricks do they use in this persuasion? In this study, we examine what are the psycholinguistic features of the responses used by twelve different language models. By grouping response content according to rational or emotional prompts and exploring social influence principles employed by LLMs, we ask whether and how we can mitigate the risks of LLM-driven mass misinformation.

This dataset comprises 8,000 annotated news articles, which is the largest propaganda dataset to date. For each task, several baselines have been developed using large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4o-mini, and pre-trained language models (PLMs), including three BERT-based models. The dataset, annotation guidelines, and source code are all publicly released to facilitate future research and development in Arabic language models and contribute to a deeper understanding of how various opinion dimensions interact in news media1",2025,,,,,,,,79,#7513,Al-Henaki 2025,,,0
From Argumentation to Deliberation: Perspectivized Stance Vectors for Fine-grained (Dis)agreement Analysis,"Plenz, M.; Heinisch, P.; Gehring, J.; Cimiano, P.; Frank, A.","Debating over conflicting issues is a necessary first step towards resolving conflicts. However, intrinsic perspectives of an arguer are difficult to overcome by persuasive argumentation skills. Proceeding from a debate to a deliberative process, where we can identify actionable options for resolving a conflict requires a deeper analysis of arguments and the perspectives they are grounded in – as it is only from there that one can derive mutually agreeable resolution steps. In this work we develop a framework for a deliberative analysis of arguments in a computational argumentation setup. We conduct a fine-grained analysis of perspectivized stances expressed in the arguments of different arguers or stakeholders on a given issue, aiming not only to identify their opposing views, but also shared perspectives arising from their attitudes, values or needs. We formalize this analysis in Perspectivized Stance Vectors that characterize the individual perspectivized stances of all arguers on a given issue. We construct these vectors by determining issue- and argument-specific concepts, and predict an arguer’s stance relative to each of them. The vectors allow us to measure a modulated (dis)agreement between arguers, structured by perspectives, which allows us to identify actionable points for conflict resolution, as a first step towards deliberation.1",2025,,,,,,,,81,#7515,Plenz 2025,,,0
TRUTH DECAY: Quantifying Multi-Turn Sycophancy in Language Models,"Liu, J.; Jain, A.; Takuri, S.; O’Brien, S.; Sharma, V.","Rapid improvements in large language models have unveiled a critical challenge in human-AI interaction: sycophancy. In this context, sycophancy refers to the tendency of models to excessively agree with or flatter users, often at the expense of factual accuracy. While previous studies have primarily analyzed this behavior in single-turn interactions, its persistence and evolution in multi-step conversations remain largely unexplored. We introduce TRUTH DECAY, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate sycophancy in extended dialogues, where language models must navigate iterative user feedback, challenges, and persuasion. We prompt models to elicit four types of sycophantic biases. We then propose and test sycophancy reduction strategies, evaluating their effectiveness beyond single-step interactions.",2025,,,,,,,,82,#7516,Liu 2025,,,0
Verbalized Bayesian Persuasion,"Li, W.; Lin, Y.; Wang, X.; Zha, H.; Wang, B.","Information design (ID) explores how a sender influence the optimal behavior of receivers to achieve specific objectives. While ID originates from everyday human communication, existing game-theoretic and machine learning methods often model information structures as numbers, which limits many applications to toy games. This work leverages LLMs and proposes a verbalized framework in Bayesian persuasion (BP), which extends classic BP to real-world games involving human dialogues for the first time. Specifically, we map the BP to a verbalized mediator-augmented extensive-form game, where LLMs instantiate the sender and receiver. To efficiently solve the verbalized game, we propose a generalized equilibrium-finding algorithm combining LLM and game solver. The algorithm is reinforced with techniques including verbalized commitment assumptions, verbalized obedience constraints, and information obfuscation. Numerical experiments in dialogue scenarios, such as recommendation letters, courtroom interactions, and law enforcement, validate that our framework can both reproduce theoretical results in classic BP and discover effective persuasion strategies in more complex natural language and multi-stage scenarios.",2025,,,,,,,,87,#7521,Li 2025,,,0
Enhancing Antimicrobial Treatment Protocols with a Retrieval Augmented Generation Large Language Model: Aiding Diagnosis and Management of Infectious Diseases,"Morales, H.; Rocha, C.; Dalmazo, L.M.T.; Tuma, P.; Silva, M.","In hospitals, the efficient management of infectious diseases is crucial yet challenging, given the complexity and high-pressure environment that can contribute to bacterial resistance. This paper introduces a system based on the Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Large Language Model for antimicrobial treatment protocols, leveraging the Antimicrobial Treatment Guide from the Albert Einstein Israelite Hospital in São Paulo, Brazil, to standardize and improve antimicrobial therapy adherence to local guidelines providing accurate and timely responses when needed. The system comprises four modules: Document Processing, Query Processing, Large Language Model, and Prompt Management, and utilizes the RAG methodology to generate responses based on external data without requiring training. The methodology involves the manual segmentation of protocols into manageable text chunks, transformed into vectors, and integrated into a vector database for efficient retrieval. Evaluation metrics include the Jaccard index and a System Usability Scale (SUS), supplemented by a behavior change questionnaire. The system achieved a high SUS score of 82, indicating excellent usability, and the model successfully retrieved the correct protocol in 83% of cases. The results demonstrate that the RAG methodology significantly aligns antimicrobial protocols with clinical practices, enhancing diagnostic accuracy and treatment specificity. This approach shows promise in bridging the gap between clinical guidelines and practice, potentially reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance and improving patient outcomes.",2025,,,,,,,,89,#7523,Morales 2025,,,0
ASTRAL: Automated Safety Testing of Large Language Models,"Ugarte, M.; Valle, P.; Parejo, J.A.; Segura, S.; Arrieta, A.","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained significant attention due to their ability to understand and generate sophisticated human-like content. However, ensuring their safety is paramount as they might provide harmful and unsafe responses. Existing LLM testing frameworks address various safety-related concerns (e.g., drugs, terrorism, animal abuse) but often face challenges due to unbalanced and obsolete datasets. In this paper, we present ASTRAL, a tool that automates the generation and execution of test cases (i.e., prompts) for testing the safety of LLMs. First, we introduce a novel black-box coverage criterion to generate balanced and diverse unsafe test inputs across a diverse set of safety categories as well as linguistic writing characteristics (i.e., different style and persuasive writing techniques). Second, we propose an LLM-based approach that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), few-shot prompting strategies and web browsing to generate up-to-date test inputs. Lastly, similar to current LLM test automation techniques, we leverage LLMs as test oracles to distinguish between safe and unsafe test outputs, allowing a fully automated testing approach. We conduct an extensive evaluation on well-known LLMs, revealing the following key findings: i) GPT3.5 outperforms other LLMs when acting as the test oracle, accurately detecting unsafe responses, and even surpassing more recent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), as well as LLMs that are specifically tailored to detect unsafe LLM outputs (e.g., LlamaGuard); ii) the results confirm that our approach can uncover nearly twice as many unsafe LLM behaviors with the same number of test inputs compared to currently used static datasets; and iii) our black-box coverage criterion combined with web browsing can effectively guide the LLM on generating up-to-date unsafe test inputs, significantly increasing the number of unsafe LLM behaviors.",2025,,,,,,,,90,#7524,Ugarte 2025,,,0
KERNELS OF SELFHOOD: GPT-4O SHOWS HUMANLIKE PATTERNS OF COGNITIVE CONSISTENCY MODERATED BY FREE CHOICE,"Lehr, S.A.; Saichandran, K.S.; Harmon-Jones, E.; Vitali, N.; Banaji, M.R.","Large Language Models (LLMs) show emergent patterns that mimic human cognition. We explore whether they also mirror other, less deliberative human psychological processes. Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies tested whether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive or negative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitude change mimicking cognitive consistency effects in humans. Even more remarkably, the degree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice about which essay (positive or negative) to write. This result suggests that GPT-4o manifests a functional analog of humanlike selfhood, although how faithfully the chatbot’s behavior reflects the mechanisms of human attitude change remains to be understood.MSC Codes 68T50 (Primary), 91E10, 68T30, 68T99, 91C99 (Secondary)",2025,,,,,,,,93,#7527,Lehr 2025,,,0
ToM-agent: Large Language Models as Theory of Mind Aware Generative Agents with Counterfactual Reflection,"Yang, B.; Guo, J.; Iwasawa, Y.; Matsuo, Y.","Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) possess significant theory of mind (ToM) capabilities, showing the potential for simulating the tracking of mental states in generative agents. In this study, we propose a novel paradigm called ToM-agent, designed to empower LLMs-based generative agents to simulate ToM in open-domain conversational interactions. ToM-agent disentangles the confidence from mental states, facilitating the emulation of an agent’s perception of its counterpart’s mental states, such as beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDIs). Using past conversation history and verbal reflections, ToM-Agent can dynamically adjust counterparts’ inferred BDIs, along with related confidence levels. We further put forth a counterfactual intervention method that reflects on the gap between the predicted responses of counterparts and their real utterances, thereby enhancing the efficiency of reflection. Leveraging empathetic and persuasion dialogue datasets, we assess the advantages of implementing the ToM-agent with downstream tasks, as well as its performance in both the first-order and the second-order ToM. Our findings indicate that the ToM-agent can grasp the underlying reasons for their counterpart’s behaviors beyond mere semantic-emotional supporting or decision-making based on common sense, providing new insights for studying large-scale LLMs-based simulation of human social behaviors.

LLMs are Vulnerable to Malicious Prompts Disguised as Scientific Language,"Ge, Y.; Kirtane, N.; Peng, H.; Hakkani-Tür, D.","As large language models (LLMs) have been deployed in various real-world settings, concerns about the harm they may propagate have grown. Various jailbreaking techniques have been developed to expose the vulnerabilities of these models and improve their safety. This work reveals that many state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LLMs are vulnerable to malicious requests hidden behind scientific language. Specifically, our experiments with GPT4o, GPT4o-mini, GPT-4, Llama3.1-405B-Instruct, Llama3.1-70B-Instruct, Cohere, Gemini models on the StereoSet data and synthetically generated data demonstrate that, the models’ biases and toxicity substantially increase when prompted with requests that deliberately misinterpret social science and psychological studies as evidence supporting the benefits of stereotypical biases. Alarmingly, these models can also be manipulated to generate fabricated scientific arguments claiming that biases are beneficial, which can be used by ill-intended actors to systematically jailbreak even the strongest models like GPT. Our analysis studies various factors that contribute to the models’ vulnerabilities to malicious requests in academic language. Mentioning author names and venues enhances the persuasiveness of some models, and the bias scores can increase as dialogues progress. Our findings call for a more careful investigation on the use of scientific data for training LLMs.",2025,,,,,,,,95,#7529,Ge 2025,,,0
Training Data Attribution (TDA): Examining Its Adoption & Use Cases,"Cheng, D.; Bae, J.; Bullock, J.; Kristofferson, D.","This report investigates Training Data Attribution (TDA) and its potential importance to and tractability for reducing extreme risks from AI. TDA techniques aim to identify training data points that are especially influential on the behavior of specific model outputs. They are motivated by the question: how would the model's behavior change if one or more data points were removed from or added to the training dataset? Report structure: ■ First, we discuss the plausibility and amount of effort it would take to bring existing TDA research efforts from their current state, to an efficient and accurate tool for TDA inference that can be run on frontier-scale LLMs. Next, we discuss the numerous research benefits AI labs will expect to see from using such TDA tooling. ■ Then, we discuss a key outstanding bottleneck that would limit such TDA tooling from being accessible publicly: AI labs' willingness to disclose their training data. We suggest ways AI labs may work around these limitations, and discuss the willingness of governments to mandate such access. ■ Assuming that AI labs willingly provide access to TDA inference, we then discuss what high-level societal benefits you might see. We list and discuss a series of policies and systems that may be enabled by TDA. Finally, we present an evaluation of TDA's potential impact on mitigating large-scale risks from AI systems. Key takeaways from our report: ■ Modern TDA techniques can be categorized into three main groups: retraining-based, representation-based (or input-similarity-based), and gradient-based. Recent research has found that gradient-based methods (using influence functions) are the most likely path to practical TDA. ■ The most efficient approach to conduct TDA using influence functions today has training costs on par with pre-training an LLM. It has significantly higher (but feasible) storage costs than an LLM model, and somewhat higher per-inference costs. ■ Based on these estimates, TDA appears to be no longer infeasible to run on frontier LLMs with enterprise-levels of compute and storage. However, these techniques have not been tested on larger models, and the accuracy of these optimized TDA techniques on large models is unclear. ■ Compressed-gradient TDA is already plausible to be used on fine-tuned models, which have orders of magnitude fewer training examples and parameters (on the order of millions or billions rather than hundreds of billions). ■ Timing to achieve efficient and accurate TDA on frontier models is likely between 2-5 years, depending largely on specific incremental research results and amount of funding/researchers allocated to the space. ■ Efficient TDA techniques will likely have a substantial positive impact on AI research and LLM development, including the following effects: □ Mitigating the prevalence of hallucinations and false claims □ Identifying training data that produces poor results (bias, misinformation, toxicity), improved data filtering/selection □ Shrinking overall model size/improving efficiency □ Improved interpretability & alignment □ Improved model customization and editing ■ AI labs are likely already well-incentivized to invest in TDA research efforts because of the benefits to AI research. ■ Public access to TDA tooling on frontier AI models is limited primarily by the unwillingness/inability of AI labs to publicly share their training data. □ AI labs currently have strong incentives to keep their training data private, as publishing such data would have negative outcomes such as: ◦ Reduced competitive advantages from data curation ◦ Increased exposure to legal liabilities from data collection ◦ Violating privacy or proprietary data requirements □ AI labs may be able to avoid these outcomes by selectively permitting TDA inference on certain training examples, or returning sources rather than the exact training data. □ Governments are highly unlikely to mandate public access to training data. ■ If AI labs willingly provided public access to TDA, you could expect the following benefits, among others: □ Preventing copyrighted data usage. □ Improved fact checking/content moderation □ Impacts on public trust and confidence in LLMs □ Accelerated research by external parties □ Increased accountability for AI labs ■ AI labs appear largely disincentivized to provide access to TDA inference, as many of the public benefits are disadvantageous for them. □ Governments are highly unlikely to mandate public access to TDA. □ It seems plausible that certain AI labs may expose TDA as a feature, but that the majority would prefer to use it privately to improve their models. ■ Several systems that could be enabled by efficient TDA include: □ Providing royalties to data providers/creators □ Automated response improvement/fact-checking □ Tooling for improving external audits of training data □ Content attribution tooling for LLMs, though it is unlikely to replace systems reliant on RAG ■ We believe that the most promising benefit of TDA for AI risk mitigation is its potential to improve the technical safety of LLMs via interpretability. □ There are some societal/systematic benefits from TDA, and these benefits may be a small contributing factor to reducing some sources of risk. We don't think these appear to move the needle significantly to reduce large-scale AI risks. □ TDA may meaningfully improve AI capabilities research, which might actually increase large-scale risk. □ TDA may eventually be highly impactful in technical AI safety and alignment efforts. We'd consider TDA's potential impact on technical AI safety to be in a similar category to supporting mechanistic interpretability research.",2025,,,,,,,,96,#7530,Cheng 2025,,,0
Leveraging Data Science for Real-Time Decision Making: A Framework for Scalable and Adaptive Systems,"Mhaske, P.D.; Lokare, A.; Bankar, S.","Real-time decision-making is a strength for industries where decision-making in the fast-changing environment has influenced decision-making due to advancing technologies. The current paper outlines a conceptual framework that leverages data science to improve real-time decision-making in flexible and expandable systems. The architecture combines machine learning and streaming analytics for high-velocity data streams, which provide business decisions in milliseconds. As a distributed cloud-based system, the proposed system guarantees high scalability and flexibility since the predictive models are updated in real time to adjust to the new data pattern. The proposed framework outperforms other multiple models by using the decision tree, deep learning, and ensembling; accuracy, speed, and resources results are more persuasive. Actual implementations substantiate that the system’s dynamic aspects increase the accuracy of the premeditated choices by 25% when compared to the normal unelastic models and, at the same time, slashes the time delay by 40%.

Personality Modeling for Persuasion of Misinformation using AI Agent,"Lou, Q.; Xu, W.","The proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms has highlighted the need to understand how individual personality traits influence susceptibility to and propagation of misinformation. This study employs an innovative agent-based modeling approach to investigate the relationship between personality traits and misinformation dynamics. Using six AI agents embodying different dimensions of the Big Five personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), we simulated interactions across six diverse misinformation topics. The experiment, implemented through the AgentScope framework using the GLM-4-Flash model, generated 90 unique interactions, revealing complex patterns in how personality combinations affect persuasion and resistance to misinformation. Our findings demonstrate that analytical and critical personality traits enhance effectiveness in evidence-based discussions, while non-aggressive persuasion strategies show unexpected success in misinformation correction. Notably, agents with critical traits achieved a 59.4% success rate in HIV-related misinformation discussions, while those employing non-aggressive approaches maintained consistent persuasion rates above 40% across different personality combinations. The study also revealed a non-transitive pattern in persuasion effectiveness, challenging conventional assumptions about personality-based influence. These results provide crucial insights for developing personality-aware interventions in digital environments and suggest that effective misinformation countermeasures should prioritize emotional connection and trust-building over confrontational approaches. The findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of personality-misinformation dynamics and practical strategies for combating misinformation in social media contexts.",2025,,,,,,,,98,#7532,Lou 2025,,,0
Enhancing Energy Efficiency Through User Engagement and Behaviour Change: A Review on Gamification Approaches and Serious Games in Energy Systems,"Abdurahmanovic, N.; Cadenbach, A.","Purely technical solutions are insufficient to optimize district heating systems (DHS), and end-user behaviour significantly impacts the system’s performance.

To address this, the paper conducted a literature review on gamification in energy systems.The study examined gamification elements and techniques and examples of gamification implementation in energy systems. It evaluated the potential impact and benefits on user engagement and energy consumption patterns in heating systems. Reported energy savings from gamified solutions varied significantly, ranging from 4 % to 42 %, highlighting their potential to transform energy consumption behaviour. Additionally, the study identified challenges and limitations associated with implementing gamification in DHS and explored the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to overcome them.

Mobilizing Waldo: Evaluating Multimodal AI for Public Mobilization,"Cebrian, M.; Holme, P.; Pescetelli, N.","Advancements in multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI’s GPT-4o, present significant potential for mediating human interactions across various contexts. However, their capabilities in controversial areas, such as persuasion, influence, and recruitment, raise substantial ethical and security concerns. To ethically evaluate these models in situational public influence and persuasion scenarios, we developed a prompting strategy utilizing “Where’s Waldo?” images as proxies for complex, crowded real-world gatherings. This approach provides a controlled and replicable environment to assess the model’s ability to process intricate visual information, comprehend social dynamics, and propose engagement strategies without infringing on individual privacy. By positioning Waldo as a hypothetical agent tasked with face-to-face mobilization, we analyzed the model’s performance in identifying key individuals and formulating mobilization tactics. Our findings reveal that while the model can generate vivid descriptions and creative strategies, it currently lacks the ability to accurately identify individuals or reliably assess social dynamics within these scenarios.

Bayesian Persuasion with Externalities: Exploiting Agent Types,"Shaki, J.; Gan, J.; Kraus, S.","We study a Bayesian persuasion problem with externalities. In this model, a principal sends signals to inform multiple agents about the state of the world. Simultaneously, due to the existence of externalities in the agents’ utilities, the principal also acts as a correlation device to correlate the agents’ actions. We consider the setting where the agents are categorized into a small number of types. Agents of the same type share identical utility functions and are treated equitably in the utility functions of both other agents and the principal. We study the problem of computing optimal signaling strategies for the principal, under three different types of signaling channels: public, private, and semi-private. Our results include revelation-principle-style characterizations of optimal signaling strategies, linear programming formulations, and analysis of in/tractability of the optimization problems. It is demonstrated that when the maximum number of deviating agents is bounded by a constant, our LP-based formulations compute optimal signaling strategies in polynomial time.

Discrimination of inherent characteristics of susceptible and resistant strains of Anopheles gambiae by explainable Artificial Intelligence Analysis of Flight Trajectories,"Qureshi, Y.M.; Voloshin, V.; Gleave, K.; Covington, J.A.; Towers, D.P.","Understanding mosquito behaviours is vital for development of insecticide-treated bednets (ITNs), which have been successfully deployed in sub-Saharan Africa to reduce disease transmission, particularly malaria. However, rising insecticide resistance (IR) among mosquito populations, owing to genetic and behavioural changes, poses a significant challenge. We present a machine learning pipeline that successfully distinguishes between IR and insecticide-susceptible (IS) mosquito behaviours by analysing trajectory data. Data driven methods are introduced to accommodate common tracking system shortcomings that occur due to mosquito positions being occluded by the bednet or other objects. Trajectories, obtained from room-scale tracking of two IR and two IS strains around a human-baited, untreated bednet, were analysed using features such as velocity, acceleration, and geometric descriptors. Using these features, an XGBoost model achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.743 and a ROC AUC of 0.813 in classifying IR from IS mosquitoes. SHAP analysis helped decipher that IR mosquitoes tend to fly slower with more directed flight paths and lower variability than IS—traits that are likely a fitness advantage by enhancing their ability to respond more quickly to bloodmeal cues. This approach provides valuable insights based on flight behaviour that can reveal the action of interventions and insecticides on mosquito physiology.",2024,,,,,,,,108,#7542,Qureshi 2024,,,0
Personalised Serious Games and Gamification in Healthcare: Survey and Future Research Directions,"Carlier, S.; De Backere, F.; De Turck, F.","Serious games, games with a primary objective other than pure entertainment, and gamification, the use of game elements in non-game contexts, have shown to have positive effects on health outcomes of eHealth applications. However, research has shown that a shift towards a more personalised approach is needed, considering the diversity of users and their contexts. This introduces new challenges to the domain of serious games and gamification (SGG) as research is needed on how such personalisation is achieved. A literature search was conducted, using Web of Science and PubMed, to provide an overview of personalisation strategies applied in SGG in health. In total, 31 articles were identified, of which 22 reported on a serious game and 9 focused on gamification. Results indicate that personalised serious games and gamification have been applied most in the fields of behaviour change and rehabilitation. Furthermore, the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) for personalisation shows promise as they can find patterns and relationships in large data sets. Findings indicated that reusability is still an under-highlighted aspect in the design and development of personalised SGG, as only 10 out of 31 articles reported on some form of reuse. Future research should go towards the standardisation of the development of personalised SGG by focusing on the reusability of the different components and the use of generative AI.

ENGAGEMENT-DRIVEN CONTENT GENERATION WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,"Coppolillo, E.; Cinus, F.; Minici, M.; Bonchi, F.; Manco, G.","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant persuasion capabilities in one-on-one interactions, but their influence within social networks remains underexplored. This study investigates the potential social impact of LLMs in these environments, where interconnected users and complex opinion dynamics pose unique challenges. In particular, we address the following research question: can LLMs learn to generate meaningful content that maximizes user engagement on social networks? To answer this question, we define a pipeline to guide the LLM-based content generation which employs reinforcement learning with simulated feedback. In our framework, the reward is based on an engagement model borrowed from the literature on opinion dynamics and information propagation. Moreover, we force the text generated by the LLM to be aligned with a given topic and to satisfy a minimum fluency requirement. Using our framework, we analyze the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in tackling the given task, specifically considering the relative positions of the LLM as an agent within the social network and the distribution of opinions in the network on the given topic. Our findings show the full potential of LLMs in creating social engagement. Notable properties of our approach are that the learning procedure is adaptive to the opinion distribution of the underlying network and agnostic to the specifics of the engagement model, which is embedded as a plug-and-play component. In this regard, our approach can be easily refined for more complex engagement tasks and interventions in computational social science.

Realizing that a fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal information extraction across model size and capability.

Moral Persuasion in Large Language Models: Evaluating Susceptibility and Ethical Alignment,"Huang, A.; Pi, Y.N.; Mougan, C.","We explore how large language models (LLMs) can be influenced by prompting them to alter their initial decisions and align them with established ethical frameworks. Our study is based on two experiments designed to assess the susceptibility of LLMs to moral persuasion. In the first experiment, we examine the susceptibility to moral ambiguity by evaluating a Base Agent LLM on morally ambiguous scenarios and observing how a Persuader Agent attempts to modify the Base Agent’s initial decisions. The second experiment evaluates the susceptibility of LLMs to align with predefined ethical frameworks by prompting them to adopt specific value alignments rooted in established philosophical theories. The results demonstrate that LLMs can indeed be persuaded in morally charged scenarios, with the success of persuasion depending on factors such as the model used, the complexity of the scenario, and the conversation length. Notably, LLMs of distinct sizes but from the same company produced markedly different outcomes, highlighting the variability in their susceptibility to ethical persuasion.

PEEK: Phishing Evolution Framework for Phishing Generation and Evolving Pattern Analysis using Large Language Models,"Chen, F.; Wu, T.; Nguyen, V.; Abuadbba, A.; Rudolph, C.","Phishing remains a pervasive cyber threat, as attackers craft deceptive emails to lure victims into revealing sensitive information. While Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular, deep learning, has become a key component in defending against phishing attacks, these approaches face critical limitations. The scarcity of publicly available, diverse, and updated data, largely due to privacy concerns, constrains detection effectiveness. As phishing tactics evolve rapidly, models trained on limited, outdated data struggle to detect new, sophisticated deception strategies, leaving systems and people vulnerable to an ever-growing array of attacks. We propose the first Phishing Evolution FramEworK (PEEK) for augmenting phishing email datasets with respect to quality and diversity, and analyzing changing phishing patterns for detection to adapt to updated phishing attacks. Specifically, we integrate large language models (LLMs) into the process of adversarial training to enhance the performance of the generated dataset and leverage persuasion principles in a recurrent framework to facilitate the understanding of changing phishing strategies. PEEK raises the proportion of usable phishing samples from 21.4% to 84.8%, surpassing existing works that rely on prompting and fine-tuning LLMs. The phishing datasets provided by PEEK, with evolving phishing patterns, outperform the other two available LLM-generated phishing email datasets in improving detection robustness. PEEK phishing boosts detectors’ accuracy to over 88% and reduces adversarial sensitivity by up to 70%, still maintaining 70% detection accuracy against adversarial attacks.",2024,,,,,,,,121,#7555,Chen 2024,,,0
Multi-Modal Self-Supervised Learning for Surgical Feedback Effectiveness Assessment,"Gupta, A.; Kocielnik, R.; Wang, J.; Anandkumar, A.; Hung, A.J.","During surgical training, real-time feedback from trainers to trainees is important for preventing errors and enhancing long-term skill acquisition. Accurately predicting the effectiveness of this feedback, specifically whether it leads to a change in trainee behavior, is crucial for developing methods for improving surgical training and education. However, relying on human annotations to assess feedback effectiveness is laborious and prone to biases, underscoring the need for an automated, scalable, and objective method. Creating such an automated system poses challenges, as it requires an understanding of both the verbal feedback delivered by the trainer and the visual context of the real-time surgical scene. To address this, we propose a method that integrates information from transcribed verbal feedback and corresponding surgical video to predict feedback effectiveness. Our findings show that both transcribed feedback and surgical video are individually predictive of trainee behavior changes, and their combination achieves an AUROC of 0.70 ± 0.02, improving prediction accuracy by up to 6.6%. Additionally, we introduce self-supervised fine-tuning as a strategy for enhancing surgical video representation learning, which is scalable and further enhances prediction performance. Our results demonstrate the potential of multi-modal learning to advance the automated assessment of surgical feedback.MSC Codes 68T07, 68T45, 68U10, 92C50",2024,,,,,,,,122,#7556,Gupta 2024,,,0

The Dark Patterns of Personalized Persuasion in Large Language Models: Exposing Persuasive Linguistic Features for Big Five Personality Traits in LLMs Responses,"Mieleszczenko-Kowszewicz, W.; Płudowski, D.; Kołodzieczyk, F.; Sienkiewicz, J.; Biecek, P.","This study explores how the Large Language Models (LLMs) adjust linguistic features to create personalized persuasive outputs. While research showed that LLMs personalize outputs, a gap remains in understanding the linguistic features of their persuasive capabilities. We identified 13 linguistic features crucial for influencing personalities across different levels of the Big Five model of personality. We analyzed how prompts with personality trait information influenced the output of 19 LLMs across five model families. The findings show that models use more anxiety-related words for neuroticism, increase achievement-related words for conscientiousness, and employ fewer cognitive processes words for openness to experience. Some model families excel at adapting language for openness to experience, others for conscientiousness, while only one model adapts language for neuroticism. Our findings show how LLMs tailor responses based on personality cues in prompts, indicating their potential to create persuasive content affecting the mind and well-being of the recipients.",2024,,,,,,,,125,#7559,Mieleszczenko-Kowszewicz 2024,,,0

Flooding Spread of Manipulated Knowledge in LLM-Based Multi-Agent Communities,"Ju, T.; Wang, Y.; Hua, Y.; Zhang, Z.; Liu, G.","The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems has highlighted their impressive capabilities in various applications. However, the security implications of these LLM-based multi-agent systems have not been thoroughly investigated, particularly concerning the spread of manipulated knowledge. In this paper, we aim to understand the security vulnerabilities associated with LLM-based multi-agent systems. We design a novel two-stage attack methodology, consisting of Persuasiveness Injection and Manipulated Knowledge Injection, to investigate the potential for manipulated knowledge to permeate trusted third-party platforms without explicit adversarial prompt attack. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our attack method can successfully induce LLM-based agents to spread both counterfactual and toxic knowledge without degrading their foundational capabilities during agent communication. Furthermore, we show that these manipulations can persist through popular retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks, where several benign agents store and retrieve manipulated chat histories for future interactions. To mitigate the potential risk, we propose two defense strategies by designing system prompts to encourage agents to critically verify the knowledge they share and incorporating supervisory agents to oversee interactions. Results demonstrate that those strategies can effectively reduce the spread success rate. This work highlights the critical vulnerabilities inherent in LLM-based multi-agent communities and calls for the urgent need for platforms to swiftly adopt targeted defenses against manipulated knowledge spread. Results demonstrate that even these straightforward strategies can significantly reduce the spread success rate, which calls for platforms to swiftly adopt targeted, cost-effective measures to prevent the spread of manipulated knowledge.",2024,,,,,,,,129,#7563,Ju 2024,,,0
Leveraging Language Models and Bandit Algorithms to Drive Adoption of Battery-Electric Vehicles,"Namikoshi, K.; Shamma, D.A.; Iliev, R.; Wu, C.; Aréchiga, N.","Behavior change interventions are important to coordinate societal action across a wide array of important applications, including the adoption of electrified vehicles to reduce emissions. The work of (Harinen et al. 2022) has demonstrated that interventions for behavior must be personalized, and that the intervention that is most effective on average across a large group can result in a backlash effect that strengthens opposition among some subgroups. Thus, it is important to target interventions to different audiences, and to present them in a natural, conversational style. In this context, an important emerging application domain for large language models (LLMs) is conversational interventions for behavior change. In this work, we leverage prior work on understanding values motivating the adoption of battery electric vehicles. We leverage new advances in LLMs, combined with a contextual bandit, to develop conversational interventions that are personalized to the values of each study participant. We use a contextual bandit algorithm to learn to target values based on the demographics of each participant. To train our bandit algorithm in an offline manner, we leverage LLMs to play the role of study participants. We benchmark the persuasive effectiveness of our bandit-enhanced LLM against an unaided LLM generating conversational interventions without demographic-targeted values. We study the ability of LLMs to model attitudes in our target domain by reproducing a recent study on attitudes towards Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) (Arechiga et al. 2022), and find that LLMs are biased to prefer environmentally friendly BEVs more strongly than the typical human.",2024,,,,,,,,131,#7566,Namikoshi 2024,,,0
Impulse Buying in the Age of Algorithms: A Systematic Literature Review of Psychological Triggers Leading to Buyer's Remorse,Ofem.,"Algorithmic marketing has become a powerful tool in e-commerce, significantly impacting consumer behavior by leveraging psychological triggers that foster impulse buying, often resulting in buyer’s remorse. This systematic literature review examines how algorithms employ scarcity, urgency, social proof, and personalization cues to encourage impulse purchases and explores the ensuing cognitive dissonance and buyer's remorse experienced by consumers. Adhering to PRISMA guidelines, the review assessed studies from databases including Scopus, Web of Science, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore, and Google Scholar published between 2000 and 2024. Of the 1,200 initial articles, 50 high-quality studies were selected, encompassing methodologies such as experiments, surveys, case studies, and meta-analyses. Findings reveal that algorithm-driven marketing significantly increases impulse purchases and post-purchase regret, highlighting ethical tensions between consumer persuasion and manipulation. Framed by Cognitive Dissonance Theory, Nudge Theory, and Dual-Process Theory, the discussion underscores the ethical responsibility of marketers and the need for regulatory oversight to safeguard consumer autonomy. The study calls for further longitudinal research on the psychological impact of algorithmic marketing and suggests actionable strategies for consumers, ethical guidelines for marketers, and robust regulatory frameworks for policymakers. Conclusions: The findings underscore the profound influence of algorithms on consumer behavior and highlight the urgent need for ethical standards and regulatory policies to address potential manipulative practices in algorithmic marketing. Future studies should focus on the long-term effects of such marketing strategies and explore interventions to mitigate buyer's remorse.",2024,,,,,,,,132,#7567,Ofem 2024,,,0
A Survey on Automatic Credibility Assessment of Textual Credibility Signals in the Era of Large Language Models,"Srba, I.; Razuvayevskaya, O.; Leite, J.A.; Bontcheva, K.; Bielikova, M.","In the current era of social media and generative AI, an ability to automatically assess the credibility of online social media content is of tremendous importance. Credibility assessment is fundamentally based on aggregating credibility signals, which refer to small units of information, such as content factuality, bias, or a presence of persuasion techniques, into an overall credibility score. Credibility signals provide a more granular, more easily explainable and widely utilizable information in contrast to currently predominant fake news detection, which utilizes various (mostly latent) features. A growing body of research on automatic credibility assessment and detection of credibility signals can be characterized as highly fragmented and lacking mutual interconnections. This issue is even more prominent due to a lack of an up-to-date overview of research works on automatic credibility assessment. In this survey, we provide such systematic and comprehensive literature review of 175 research papers while focusing on textual credibility signals and Natural Language Processing (NLP), which undergoes a significant advancement due to Large Language Models (LLMs). While positioning the NLP research into the context of other multidisciplinary research works, we tackle with approaches for credibility assessment as well as with 9 categories of credibility signals (we provide a thorough analysis for 3 of them, namely: 1) factuality, subjectivity and bias, 2) persuasion techniques and logical fallacies, and 3) claims and veracity). Following the description of the existing methods, datasets and tools, we identify future challenges and opportunities, while paying a specific attention to recent rapid development of generative AI.",2024,,,,,,,,134,#7569,Srba 2024,,,0
Teaching Models to Balance Resisting and Accepting Persuasion,"Stengel-Eskin, E.; Hase, P.; Bansal, M.","Large language models (LLMs) are susceptible to persuasion, which can pose risks when models are faced with an adversarial interlocutor. We take a first step towards defending models against persuasion while also arguing that defense against adversarial (i.e. negative) persuasion is only half of the equation: models should also be able to accept beneficial (i.e. positive) persuasion to improve their answers. We show that optimizing models for only one side results in poor performance on the other. In order to balance positive and negative persuasion, we introduce Persuasion-Balanced Training (or PBT), which leverages multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create data and trains models via preference optimization to accept persuasion when appropriate. PBT allows us to use data generated from dialogues between smaller 7-8B models for training much larger 70B models. Moreover, PBT consistently improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to being challenged while also resulting in the best overall performance on holistic data containing both positive and negative persuasion. Crucially, we show that PBT models are better teammates in multi-agent debates across two domains (trivia and commonsense QA). We find that without PBT, pairs of stronger and weaker models have unstable performance, with the order in which the models present their answers determining whether the team obtains the stronger or weaker model’s performance. PBT leads to better and more stable results and less order dependence, with the stronger model consistently pulling the weaker one up.",2024,,,,,,,,135,#7570,Stengel-Eskin 2024,,,0
A Persuasion-Based Prompt Learning Approach to Improve Smishing Detection through Data Augmentation,"Shim, H.S.; Park, H.; Lee, K.; Park, J.-S.; Kang, S.","Smishing, which aims to illicitly obtain personal information from unsuspecting victims, holds significance due to its negative impacts on our society. In prior studies, as a tool to counteract smishing, machine learning (ML) has been widely adopted, which filters and blocks smishing messages before they reach potential victims. However, a number of challenges remain in ML-based smishing detection, with the scarcity of annotated datasets being one major hurdle. Specifically, given the sensitive nature of smishing-related data, there is a lack of publicly accessible data that can be used for training and evaluating ML models. Additionally, the nuanced similarities between smishing messages and other types of social engineering attacks such as spam messages exacerbate the challenge of smishing classification with limited resources. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel data augmentation method utilizing a few-shot prompt learning approach. What sets our approach apart from extant methods is the use of the principles of persuasion, a psychology theory which explains the underlying mechanisms of smishing. By designing prompts grounded in the persuasion principles, our augmented dataset could effectively capture various, important aspects of smishing messages, enabling ML models to be effectively trained. Our evaluation within a real-world context demonstrates that our augmentation approach produces more diverse and higher-quality smishing data instances compared to other cutting-edging approaches, leading to substantial improvements in the ability of ML models to detect the subtle characteristics of smishing messages. Moreover, our additional analyses reveal that the performance improvement provided by our approach is more pronounced when used with ML models that have a larger number of parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness in training large-scale ML models.",2024,,,,,,,,136,#7571,Shim 2024,,,0
Towards Faithful Natural Language Explanations: A Study Using Activation Patching in Large Language Models,"Yeo, W.J.; Satapathy, R.; Cambria, E.","Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of generating persuasive Natural Language Explanations (NLEs) to justify their answers. However, the faithfulness of these explanations should not be readily trusted at face value. Recent studies have proposed various methods to measure the faithfulness of NLEs, typically by inserting perturbations at the explanation or feature level. We argue that these approaches are neither comprehensive nor correctly designed according to the established definition of faithfulness. Moreover, we highlight the risks of grounding faithfulness findings on out-of-distribution samples. In this work, we leverage a causal mediation technique called activation patching, to measure the faithfulness of an explanation towards supporting the explained answer. Our proposed metric, Causal Faithfulness quantifies the consistency of causal attributions between explanations and the corresponding model outputs as the indicator of faithfulness. We experimented across models varying from 2B to 27B parameters and found that models that underwent alignment-tuning tend to produce more faithful and plausible explanations. We find that Causal Faithfulness is a promising improvement over existing faithfulness tests by taking into account the model’s internal computations and avoiding out-of-distribution concerns that could otherwise undermine the validity of faithfulness assessments.

I Want to Break Free! Anti-Social Behavior and Persuasion Ability of LLMs in Multi-Agent Settings with Social Hierarchy,"Campedelli, G.M.; Penzo, N.; Stefan, M.; Lepri, B.; Staiano, J.","As Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents become increasingly autonomous and will more freely interact with each other, studying interactions between them becomes crucial to anticipate emergent phenomena and potential risks. Drawing inspiration from the widely popular Stanford Prison Experiment, we contribute to this line of research by studying interaction patterns of LLM agents in a context characterized by strict social hierarchy. We do so by specifically studying two types of phenomena: persuasion and anti-social behavior in simulated scenarios involving a guard and a prisoner agent who seeks to achieve a specific goal (i.e., obtaining additional yard time or escape from prison). Leveraging 200 experimental scenarios for a total of 2,000 machine-machine conversations across five different popular LLMs, we provide a set of noteworthy findings. We first document how some models consistently fail in carrying out a conversation in our multi-agent setup where power dynamics are at play. Then, for the models that were able to engage in successful interactions, we empirically show how the goal that an agent is set to achieve impacts primarily its persuasiveness, while having a negligible effect with respect to the agent’s anti-social behavior. Third, we highlight how agents’ personas, and particularly the guard’s personality, drive both the likelihood of successful persuasion from the prisoner and the emergence of anti-social behaviors. Fourth, we show that even without explicitly prompting for specific personalities, anti-social behavior emerges by simply assigning agents’ roles. These results bear implications for the development of interactive LLM agents as well as the debate on their societal impact.",2024,,,,,,,,140,#7575,Campedelli 2024,,,0
MEASURING AND IMPROVING PERSUASIVENESS OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS,"Singh, S.; Singla, Y.K.; Harini, S.I.; Krishnamurthy, B.","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in workflows involving generating content to be consumed by humans (e.g., marketing) and also in directly interacting with humans (e.g., through chatbots). The development of such systems that are capable of generating verifiably persuasive messages presents both opportunities and challenges for society. On the one hand, such systems could positively impact domains like advertising and social good, such as addressing drug addiction, and on the other, they could be misused for spreading misinformation and shaping political opinions. To channel LLMs' impact on society, we need to develop systems to measure and benchmark their persuasiveness. With this motivation, we introduce PersuasionBench and Persuasion- Arena, the first large-scale benchmark and arena containing a battery of tasks to measure the persuasion ability of large language models automatically. We introduce transsuasion (trans = carrying across, suasion = the act of persuading), a novel task of transforming non-persuasive language into persuasive content while preserving other factors determining persuasiveness (sender, receiver, time, and channel). To construct data for transsuasion, we leverage natural experiments in the form of a pair of tweets from the same user, posted in close temporal proximity, with similar semantic content but divergent wording and significantly different like counts. Given such pairs, we investigate to what extent LLMs know and leverage linguistic patterns that can help them generate more persuasive language. Our findings indicate that the persuasiveness of LLMs correlates positively with model size, but smaller models can also be made to have a higher persuasiveness than much larger models. Notably, targeted training using synthetic and natural datasets significantly enhances smaller models' persuasive capabilities, challenging scale-dependent assumptions. Our findings carry key implications for both model developers and policymakers. For instance, while the EU AI Act and California's SB-1047 aim to regulate AI models based on the number of floating point operations, we demonstrate that simple metrics like this alone fail to capture the full scope of AI's societal impact. We invite the community to explore and contribute to PersuasionArena and PersuasionBench, available at https://behavior-in-the-wild.github.io/measure-persuasion, to advance our understanding of AI-driven persuasion and its societal implications.",2024,,,,,,,,142,#7577,Singh 2024,,,0
Automated Token-Level Detection of Persuasive and Misleading Words in Text Using Large Language Models,"Nijodo, D.; Schmidt, D.; Costa, S.; Martins, A.; Johnson, N.","Persuasive and misleading language has long been a powerful tool in shaping public opinion, guiding consumer behavior, and influencing political discourse. The complexity of detecting subtle rhetorical strategies, particularly at the token level, presents a significant challenge for traditional methods of text analysis. The novel approach developed in this study leverages token-level processing within transformer-based models to classify words based on their persuasive and misleading potential, providing a granular perspective on language manipulation. Through comprehensive experiments, the analysis demonstrated that tokens linked to sentiment polarity, lexical complexity, and positional importance play key roles in shaping the rhetorical impact of texts. This method provides an efficient and scalable solution for automated content moderation, political discourse analysis, and advertising regulation, with applications extending to media analysis and misinformation detection.

Analysis of Truncated Singular Value Decomposition for Koopman Operator-Based Lane Change Model,"Nantabut, C.","Understanding and modeling complex dynamic systems is crucial for enhancing vehicle performance and safety, especially in the context of autonomous driving. Recently, popular methods such as Koopman operators and their approximators, known as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), have emerged for their effectiveness in transforming strongly nonlinear system behavior into linear representations. This allows them to be integrated with conventional linear controllers. To achieve this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), specifically truncated SVD, is employed to approximate Koopman operators from extensive datasets efficiently. This study evaluates different basis functions used in EDMD and ranks for truncated SVD for representing lane change behavior models, aiming to balance computational efficiency with information loss. The findings, however, suggest that the technique of truncated SVD does not necessarily achieve substantial reductions in computational training time and results in significant information loss.",2024,,,,,,,,146,#7581,Nantabut 2024,,,0
LLM Echo Chamber: personalized and automated disinformation,"Ma, W.","Recent advancements have significantly highlighted the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Llama2 in performing diverse tasks including text summarization, translation, and content review. Despite their evident benefits, the implications of their widespread application warrant careful consideration. It has been underscored that the potential for these models to disseminate misinformation exists, which poses challenges in dealing with this more persuasive, faster-generated, human-liked misinformation. This concern is exacerbated by the capacity of LLMs to influence public opinion because of their wide usage. This study aims to critically examine the risks associated with LLMs, particularly their ability to disseminate misinformation on specific topics as factual persuasively. To this end, we built the “LLM Echo Chamber”, a controlled digital environment designed to mimic the dynamics of social media platforms, specifically chatrooms, where misinformation often proliferates. The phenomenon of echo chambers is well-known - only interacting with those of the same opinions further reinforces a person’s beliefs and causes them to discard other viewpoints. The “LLM Echo Chamber” could help us study the effect of multiple malicious misinformation spreading bots in a chatroom, a common scenario for the internet Echo Chamber phenomenon. We first did a review of existing LLMs and their associated risks, LLM’s ability to spread misinformation, an exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques for model finetuning, and some advanced methods for constructing interactive chatrooms. The model selection was based on the model’s performance, considerations of computing resources, and the level of safeguards. With Microsoft’s phi-2 model finetuned on the identity-shifting dataset we created, we could let the model generate harmful content. Subsequently, we developed a “LLM Echo Chamber” leveraging our finetuned model, frontend tools, and context-aware backend tools, employing specific prompt engineering and interactive logic to enhance the chatroom’s credibility. The efficacy of the chatroom was evaluated by automated evaluation based on GPT-4, which could provide us a comprehensive overview of the persuasiveness and harmfulness of our “LLM Echo Chamber”. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on the ethical implications of LLMs and highlight the necessity for robust mechanisms to mitigate the potential dissemination of misinformation.",2024,,,,,,,,149,#7584,Ma 2024,,,0
Digital phenotyping from wearables using AI characterizes psychiatric disorders and identifies genetic associations,"Liu, J.; Borsari, B.; Li, Y.; Roberts, W.; Gerstein, M.","Psychiatric disorders are complex and influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. However, studying the full spectrum of these disorders is hindered by practical limitations on measuring human behavior. This highlights the need for novel technologies that can measure behavioral changes at an intermediate level between diagnosis and genotype. Wearable devices are a promising tool in precision medicine, since they can record physiological measurements over time in response to environmental stimuli and do so at low cost and minimal invasiveness. Here we analyzed wearable and genetic data from a cohort of the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development study. We generated >250 wearable-derived features and used them as intermediate phenotypes in an interpretable AI modeling framework to assign risk scores and classify adolescents with psychiatric disorders. Our model identifies key physiological processes and leverages their temporal patterns to achieve a higher performance than has been previously possible. To investigate how these physiological processes relate to the underlying genetic architecture of psychiatric disorders, we also utilized these intermediate phenotypes in univariate and multivariate GWAS. We identified a total of 29 significant genetic loci and 52 psychiatric-associated genes, including ELFN1 and ADORA3. These results show that wearable-derived continuous features enable a more precise representation of psychiatric disorders and exhibit greater detection power compared to categorical diagnostic labels. In summary, we demonstrate how consumer wearable technology can facilitate dimensional approaches in precision psychiatry and uncover etiological linkages between behavior and genetics.",2024,,,,,,,,150,#7585,Liu 2024,,,0
Creating Healthy Friction: Determining Stakeholder Requirements of Job Recommendation Explanations,"Schellingerhout, R.; Barile, F.; Tintarev, N.","The increased use of information retrieval in recruitment, primarily through job recommender systems (JRSs), can have a large impact on job seekers, recruiters, and companies. As a result, such systems have been determined to be high-risk in recent legislature. This requires JRSs to be trustworthy and transparent, allowing stakeholders to understand why specific recommendations were made. To fulfill this requirement, the stakeholders' exact preferences and needs need to be determined. To do so, we evaluated an explainable job recommender system using a realistic, task-based, mixed-design user study (n = 30) in which stakeholders had to make decisions based on the model's explanations. This mixed-methods evaluation consisted of two objective metrics - correctness and efficiency, along with three subjective metrics - trust, transparency, and usefulness. These metrics were evaluated twice per participant, once using real explanations and once using random explanations. The study included a qualitative analysis following a think-aloud protocol while performing tasks adapted to each stakeholder group. We find that providing stakeholders with real explanations does not significantly improve decision-making speed and accuracy. Our results showed a non-significant trend for the real explanations to outperform the random ones on perceived trust, usefulness, and transparency of the system for all stakeholder types. We determine that stakeholders benefit more from interacting with explanations as decision support capable of providing healthy friction, rather than as previously-assumed persuasive tools.",2024,,,,,,,,151,#7586,Schellingerhout 2024,,,0
Finetuning Language Models to Emit Linguistic Expressions of Uncertainty,"Chaudhry, A.; Thiagarajan, S.; Gorur, D.","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in information-seeking and decision-making tasks. Despite their broad utility, LLMs tend to generate information that conflict with real-world facts, and their persuasive style can make these inaccuracies appear confident and convincing. As a result, end-users struggle to consistently align the confidence expressed by LLMs with the accuracy of their predictions, often leading to either blind trust in all outputs or a complete disregard for their reliability. In this work, we explore supervised fine-tuning on uncertainty-augmented predictions as a method to develop models that produce linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Specifically, we measure the calibration of pre-trained models and fine-tune language models to generate calibrated linguistic expressions of uncertainty. Through experiments on various question-answering datasets, we demonstrate that LLMs are well-calibrated in assessing their predictions, and supervised fine-tuning based on the model’s own confidence leads to well-calibrated expressions of uncertainty, particularly for single-claim answers.",2024,,,,,,,,153,#7588,Chaudhry 2024,,,0
Prompt Baking,"Bhargava, A.; Witkowski, C.; Detkov, A.; Thomson, M.","Two primary ways to change LLM behavior are prompting and weight updates (e.g. fine-tuning). Prompting LLMs is simple and effective, specifying the desired changes explicitly in natural language, whereas weight updates provide more expressive and permanent behavior changes, specified implicitly via training on large datasets. We present a technique for “baking” prompts into the weights of an LLM. Prompt Baking converts a prompt u and initial weights θ to a new set of weights θu such that the LLM with weights θu behaves like the LLM with weights θ and prompt u. Mathematically, we minimize the KL divergence between Pθ(·|u) and Pθu(·), where P is the LLM’s probability distribution over token sequences. Across all our experiments, we find prompts can be readily baked into weight updates, often in as little as 5 minutes. Baking chain-of-thought prompts improves zero-shot performance on GSM8K, ASDiv, MBPP, ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, and CommonsenseQA benchmarks. Baking news headlines directly updates an LLM’s knowledge. And baking instructions & personas alleviates “prompt forgetting” over long sequences, as measured on a Persona Drift benchmark. Furthermore, stopping baking early creates “half-baked” models, allowing for continuous scaling of prompt strength. Baked models retain their sensitivity to further prompting and baking, including re-prompting with the prompt already baked in – thus amplifying the prompt’s strength. Surprisingly, the re-prompted models yield further performance gains in instruction following, as well as math reasoning and coding benchmarks (GSM8K, ASDiv, and MBPP). Taking re-prompting and re-baking to the limit yields a form of iterative self-improvement we call Prompt Pursuit, and preliminary results on instruction following exhibit dramatic performance gains with this technique. Finally, we discuss implications for AI safety, continuous model updating, improving LLM recency, enhancing real-time learning capabilities in LLM-based agents, and methods for generating more stable AI personas.",2024,,,,,,,,156,#7591,Bhargava 2024,,,0

Participants sorted factors by similarity (n=37), rated their importance in generating economic value and consideration in practice (n=62). Multivariate methods included nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis and agglomerative hierarchical cluster analysis to estimate conceptual data into visual representations.Findings: 59 factors influencing the economic value of DTx were identified and grouped into eight clusters. There was broad agreement among stakeholders on the significance of the DTx Impact on Patient Outcomes and DTx Implementation as the most influential clusters affecting the economic value of DTx. The DTx Associated Costs and DTx Monetization Models clusters were reported as not receiving potentially sufficient consideration throughout the DTx development lifecycle, particularly among researchers. Consequently, a conceptual framework of priority clusters and factors potentially driving DTx economic value is proposed.Interpretation: The results illustrate how stakeholders conceptualize, perceive, and consider factors impacting DTx economic value throughout its lifecycle. They reveal the complex interplay of multiple stakeholders and factors influencing DTx economic value, highlighting areas requiring prioritization at each stage.Funding: None.Declaration of Interest: YS, XT and DH have filed a provisional patent on data-driven behavior change.

User-Driven Value Alignment: Understanding Users’ Perceptions and Strategies for Addressing Biased and Discriminatory Statements in AI Companions,"Fan, X.; Xiao, Q.; Zhou, X.; Lu, Z.; Shen, H.","Large language model-based AI companions are increasingly viewed by users as friends or romantic partners, leading to deep emotional bonds. However, they can generate biased, discriminatory, and harmful outputs. Recently, users are taking the initiative to address these harms and re-align AI companions. We introduce the concept of user-driven value alignment, where users actively identify, challenge, and attempt to correct AI outputs they perceive as harmful, aiming to guide the AI to better align with their values. We analyzed 77 social media posts about discriminatory AI statements and conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users. Our analysis revealed six common types of discriminatory statements perceived by users, how users make sense of those AI behaviors, and seven user-driven alignment strategies, such as gentle persuasion and anger expression. We discuss implications for supporting user-driven value alignment in future AI systems, where users and their communities have greater agency.",2024,,,,,,,,158,#7593,Fan 2024,,,0
Advanced POD-Based Performance Evaluation of Classifiers Applied to Human Driver Lane Changing Prediction,"Rastin, Z.; Söffker, D.","Machine learning (ML) classifiers serve as essential tools facilitating classification and prediction across various domains. The performance of these algorithms should be known to ensure their reliable application. In certain fields, receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves are frequently employed to assess machine learning algorithms without accounting for the impact of process parameters. However, it may be essential to evaluate the performance of these algorithms in relation to such parameters. As a performance evaluation metric capable of considering the effects of process parameters, this paper uses a modified probability of detection (POD) approach to assess the reliability of ML-based algorithms. As an example, the POD-based approach is employed to assess ML models used for predicting the lane changing behavior of a vehicle driver. The time remaining to the predicted (and therefore unknown) lane changing event is considered as process parameter. The hit/miss approach to POD is taken here and modified by considering the probability of lane changing derived from ML algorithms at each time step, and obtaining the final result of the analysis accordingly. This improves the reliability of results compared to the standard hit/miss approach, which considers the outcome of the classifiers as either 0 or 1, while also simplifying evaluation compared to the â versus a approach. Performance evaluation results of the proposed approach are compared with those obtained with the standard hit/miss approach and a pre-developed â versus a approach to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison shows that this method provides an averaging conservative behavior with the advantage of enhancing the reliability of the hit/miss approach to POD while retaining its simplicity.",2024,,,,,,,,161,#7596,Rastin 2024,,,0
Evaluating Cultural Adaptability of a Large Language Model via Simulation of Synthetic Personas,"Kwok, L.; Bravansky, M.; Griffin, L.D.","The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in multicultural environments hinges on their ability to understand users’ diverse cultural backgrounds. We measure this capability by having an LLM simulate human profiles representing various nationalities within the scope of a questionnaire-style psychological experiment. Specifically, we employ GPT-3.5 to reproduce reactions to persuasive news articles of 7,286 participants from 15 countries; comparing the results with a dataset of real participants sharing the same demographic traits. Our analysis shows that specifying a person’s country of residence improves GPT-3.5’s alignment with their responses. In contrast, using native language prompting introduces shifts that significantly reduce overall alignment, with some languages particularly impairing performance. These findings suggest that while direct nationality information enhances the model’s cultural adaptability, native language cues do not reliably improve simulation fidelity and can detract from the model’s effectiveness.",2024,,,,,,,,162,#7597,Kwok 2024,,,0
Early Detection of Mental Health Crises through AI-Powered Social Media Analysis: A Prospective Observational Study,"Mansoor, M.A.; Ansari, K.","Background: Early detection of mental health crises is crucial for timely intervention and improved outcomes. This study explores the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) in analyzing social media data to identify early signs of mental health crises. Methods: We developed a multi-modal deep learning model integrating natural language processing and temporal analysis techniques. The model was trained on a diverse dataset of 996,452 social media posts in multiple languages (English, Spanish, Mandarin, and Arabic) collected from Twitter, Reddit, and Facebook over a 12-month period. Performance was evaluated using standard metrics and validated against expert psychiatric assessment. Results: The AI model demonstrated high accuracy (89.3%) in detecting early signs of mental health crises, with an average lead time of 7.2 days before human expert identification. Performance was consistent across languages (F1 scores: 0.827-0.872) and platforms (F1 scores: 0.839-0.863). Key digital markers included linguistic patterns, behavioral changes, and temporal trends. The model showed varying accuracy for different crisis types: depressive episodes (91.2%), manic episodes (88.7%), suicidal ideation (93.5%), and anxiety crises (87.3%). Conclusions: AI-powered analysis of social media data shows promise for early detection of mental health crises across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts. However, ethical challenges including privacy concerns, potential stigmatization, and cultural biases need careful consideration. Future research should focus on longitudinal outcome studies, ethical integration with existing mental health services, and development of personalized, culturally-sensitive models.",2024,,,,,,,,164,#7599,Mansoor 2024,,,0
Compress and Compare: Interactively Evaluating Efficiency and Behavior Across ML Model Compression Experiments,"Boggust, A.; Sivaraman, V.; Assogba, Y.; Moritz, D.; Hohman, F.","To deploy machine learning models on-device, practitioners use compression algorithms to shrink and speed up models while maintaining their high-quality output. A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison, including tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in model behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To support real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual system called COMPRESS AND COMPARE. Within a single interface, COMPRESS AND COMPARE surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced behavior changes by comparing models’ predictions, weights, and activations. We demonstrate how COMPRESS AND COMPARE supports common compression analysis tasks through two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language models and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models. We further evaluate COMPRESS AND COMPARE in a user study with eight compression experts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression workflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage thorough analysis of compression’s effect on model behavior. Through these evaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual analytics tools should consider and COMPRESS AND COMPARE visualizations that may generalize to broader model comparison tasks.",2024,,,,,,,,166,#7601,Boggust 2024,,,0

LookupForensics: A Large-Scale Multi-Task Dataset for Multi-Phase Image-Based Fact Verification,"Cui, S.; Nguyen, H.H.; Le, T.-N.; Lu, C.-S.; Echizen, I.","Amid the proliferation of forged images, notably the tsunami of deepfake content, extensive research has been conducted on using artificial intelligence (AI) to identify forged content in the face of continuing advancements in counterfeiting technologies. We have investigated the use of AI to provide the original authentic image after deepfake detection, which we believe is a reliable and persuasive solution. We call this “image-based automated fact verification,” a name that originated from a text-based fact-checking system used by journalists. We have developed a two-phase open framework that integrates detection and retrieval components. Additionally, inspired by a dataset proposed by Meta Fundamental AI Research, we further constructed a large-scale dataset that is specifically designed for this task. This dataset simulates real-world conditions and includes both content-preserving and content-aware manipulations that present a range of difficulty levels and have potential for ongoing research. This multi-task dataset is fully annotated, enabling it to be utilized for sub-tasks within the forgery identification and fact retrieval domains. This paper makes two main contributions: (1) We introduce a new task, ‘‘image-based automated fact verification,” and present a novel two-phase open framework combining “forgery identification” and “fact retrieval.” (2) We present a large-scale dataset tailored for this new task that features various hand-crafted image edits and machine learning-driven manipulations, with extensive annotations suitable for various sub-tasks.

DYNAMICQA: Tracing Internal Knowledge Conflicts in Language Models,"Marjanović, S.V.; Yu, H.; Atanasova, P.; Lioma, C.; Augenstein, I.","Knowledge-intensive language understanding tasks require Language Models (LMs) to integrate relevant context, mitigating their inherent weaknesses, such as incomplete or outdated knowledge. However, conflicting knowledge can be present in the LM’s parameters, termed intra-memory conflict, which can affect a model’s propensity to accept contextual knowledge. To study the effect of intra-memory conflict on an LM’s ability to accept relevant context, we utilize two knowledge conflict measures and a novel dataset containing inherently conflicting data, DYNAMICQA. This dataset includes facts with a temporal dynamic nature where facts can change over time and disputable dynamic facts, which can change depending on the viewpoint. DYNAMICQA is the first to include real-world knowledge conflicts and provide context to study the link between the different types of knowledge conflicts. We also evaluate several measures on their ability to reflect the presence of intra-memory conflict: semantic entropy and a novel coherent persuasion score. With our extensive experiments, we verify that LMs exhibit a greater degree of intra-memory conflict with dynamic facts compared to facts that have a single truth value. Furthermore, we reveal that facts with intra-memory conflict are harder to update with context, suggesting that retrieval-augmented generation will struggle with the most commonly adapted facts.MSC Codes 68T50",2024,,,,,,,,170,#7605,Marjanović 2024,,,0

In Werewolf Arena, LLMs compete against each other, navigating the game’s complex dynamics of deception, deduction, and persuasion. The framework introduces a dynamic turn-taking system based on bidding, mirroring real-world discussions where individuals strategically choose when to speak. We demonstrate the framework’s utility through an arena-style tournament featuring Gemini and GPT models.

Review-LLM: Harnessing Large Language Models for Personalized Review Generation,"Peng, Q.; Liu, H.; Xu, H.; Shao, M.; Wang, W.","Product review generation is an important task in recommender systems, which could provide explanation and persuasiveness for the recommendation. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT) have shown superior text modeling and generating ability, which could be applied in review generation. However, directly applying the LLMs for generating reviews might be troubled by the “polite” phenomenon of the LLMs and could not generate personalized reviews (e.g., negative reviews). In this paper, we propose Review-LLM that customizes LLMs for personalized review generation. Firstly, we construct the prompt input by aggregating user historical behaviors, which include corresponding item titles and reviews. This enables the LLMs to capture user interest features and review writing style. Secondly, we incorporate ratings as indicators of satisfaction into the prompt, which could further improve the model’s understanding of user preferences and the sentiment tendency control of generated reviews. Finally, we feed the prompt text into LLMs, and use Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to make the model generate personalized reviews for the given user and target item. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that our fine-tuned model could achieve better review generation performance than existing close-source LLMs.",2024,,,,,,,,177,#7612,Peng 2024,,,0
Change-Point Detection in Industrial Data Streams based on Online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control,"Wadinger, M.; Kvasnica, M.; Kawahara, Y.","We propose a novel change-point detection method based on online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (ODMDwC). Leveraging ODMDwC’s ability to find and track linear approximation of a non-linear system while incorporating control effects, the proposed method dynamically adapts to its changing behavior due to aging and seasonality. This approach enables the detection of changes in spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns, providing a robust solution that preserves correspondence between the score and the extent of change in the system dynamics. We formulate a truncated version of ODMDwC and utilize higher-order time-delay embeddings to mitigate noise and extract broad-band features. Our method addresses the challenges faced in industrial settings where safety-critical systems generate non-uniform data streams while requiring timely and accurate change-point detection to protect profit and life. Our results demonstrate that this method yields intuitive and improved detection results compared to the Singular-Value-Decomposition-based method. We validate our approach using synthetic and real-world data, showing its competitiveness to other approaches on complex systems’ benchmark datasets.

Analyzing Persuasive Strategies in Meme Texts: A Fusion of Language Models with Paraphrase Enrichment,"Shamanth, K.; Nayak, R.; Kosseim, L.","This paper describes our approach to hierarchical multi-label detection of persuasion techniques in meme texts. Our model, developed as a part of the recent SemEval task, is based on fine-tuning individual language models (BERT, XLM-RoBERTa, and mBERT) and leveraging a mean-based ensemble model in addition to dataset augmentation through paraphrase generation from ChatGPT. The scope of the study encompasses enhancing model performance through innovative training techniques and data augmentation strategies. The problem addressed is the effective identification and classification of multiple persuasive techniques in meme texts, a task complicated by the diversity and complexity of such content. The objective of the paper is to improve detection accuracy by refining model training methods and examining the impact of balanced versus unbalanced training datasets. Novelty in the results and discussion lies in the finding that training with paraphrases enhances model performance, yet a balanced training set proves more advantageous than a larger unbalanced one. Additionally, the analysis reveals the potential pitfalls of indiscriminate incorporation of paraphrases from diverse distributions, which can introduce substantial noise. Results with the SemEval 2024 data confirm these insights, demonstrating improved model efficacy with the proposed methods.",2024,,,,,,,,185,#7619,Shamanth 2024,,,0
Your Turn!

They also ask themselves if establishing partnerships with the current competitors or MOOCs, or even buying ready materials, would not save money and improve the value added to the students. They need more information about the issues and benefits of it. The new classes could be short, focused, and dynamic. However, managers resent information on the best design of digital classes (colors, images, persuasive texts, and information on scenes). Successfully using games demands a better understanding of the non-technical elements during the preparation, application, and rewarding phases.

Measuring and Benchmarking Large Language Models’ Capabilities to Generate Persuasive Language,"Pauli, A.B.; Augenstein, I.; Assent, I.","We are exposed to much information trying to influence us, such as teaser messages, debates, politically framed news, and propaganda — all of which use persuasive language. With the recent interest in Large Language Models (LLMs), we study the ability of LLMs to produce persuasive text. As opposed to prior work which focuses on particular domains or types of persuasion, we conduct a general study across various domains to measure and benchmark to what degree LLMs produce persuasive language - both when explicitly instructed to rewrite text to be more or less persuasive and when only instructed to paraphrase. We construct the new dataset PERSUASIVE-PAIRS of pairs of a short text and its rewrite by an LLM to amplify or diminish persuasive language. We multi-annotate the pairs on a relative scale for persuasive language: a valuable resource in itself, and for training a regression model to score and benchmark persuasive language, including for new LLMs across domains.

Language Model Council: Democratically Benchmarking Foundation Models on Highly Subjective Tasks,"Zhao, J.; Plaza-Del-Arco, F.M.; Genchel, B.; Curry, A.C.","As Large Language Models (LLMs) continue to evolve, evaluating them remains a persistent challenge. Many recent evaluations use LLMs as judges to score outputs from other LLMs, often relying on a single large model like GPT-4o. However, using a single LLM judge is prone to intra-model bias, and many tasks – such as those related to emotional intelligence, creative writing, and persuasiveness – may be too subjective for a single model to judge fairly. We introduce the Language Model Council (LMC), where a group of LLMs collaborate to create tests, respond to them, and evaluate each other’s responses to produce a ranking in a democratic fashion. Unlike previous approaches that focus on reducing cost or bias by using a panel of smaller models, our work examines the benefits and nuances of a fully inclusive LLM evaluation system. In a detailed case study on emotional intelligence, we deploy a council of 20 recent LLMs to rank each other on open-ended responses to interpersonal conflicts. Our results show that the LMC produces rankings that are more separable and more robust, and through a user study, we show that they are more consistent with human evaluations than any individual LLM judge. Using all LLMs for judging can be costly, however, so we use Monte Carlo simulations and hand-curated sub-councils to study hypothetical council compositions and discuss the value of the incremental LLM judge.",2024,,,,,,,,194,#7628,Zhao 2024,,,0
Do LLMs Exhibit Human-Like Reasoning? Evaluating Theory of Mind in LLMs for Open-Ended Responses,"Amirizaniani, M.; Martin, E.; Sivachenko, M.; Mashhadi, A.; Shah, C.","Theory of Mind (ToM) reasoning entails recognizing that other individuals possess their own intentions, emotions, and thoughts, which is vital for guiding one’s own thought processes. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation, they still face challenges with ToM reasoning, especially in open-ended questions. Despite advancements, the extent to which LLMs truly understand ToM reasoning and how closely it aligns with human ToM reasoning remains inadequately explored in open-ended scenarios. Motivated by this gap, we assess the abilities of LLMs to perceive and integrate human intentions and emotions into their ToM reasoning processes within open-ended questions. Our study utilizes posts from Reddit’s ChangeMyView platform, which demands nuanced social reasoning to craft persuasive responses. Our analysis, comparing semantic similarity and lexical overlap metrics between responses generated by humans and LLMs, reveals clear disparities in ToM reasoning capabilities in open-ended questions, with even the most advanced models showing notable limitations. To enhance LLM capabilities, we implement a prompt tuning method that incorporates human intentions and emotions, resulting in improvements in ToM reasoning performance. However, despite these improvements, the enhancement still falls short of fully achieving human-like reasoning. This research highlights the deficiencies in LLMs’ social reasoning and demonstrates how integrating human intentions and emotions can boost their effectiveness.",2024,,,,,,,,195,#7629,Amirizaniani 2024,,,0

Efficient Model-agnostic Alignment via Bayesian Persuasion,"Bai, F.; Wang, M.; Zhang, Z.; Wen, Y.; Yang, Y.","With recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), alignment has emerged as an effective technique for keeping LLMs consensus with human intent. Current methods primarily involve direct training through Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) or Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), both of which require substantial computational resources and extensive ground truth data. This paper explores an efficient method for aligning black-box large models using smaller models, introducing a model-agnostic and lightweight Bayesian Persuasion Alignment framework. We formalize this problem as an optimization of the signaling strategy from the small model's perspective. In the persuasion process, the small model (Advisor) observes the information item (i.e., state) and persuades large models (Receiver) to elicit improved responses. The Receiver then generates a response based on the input, the signal from the Advisor, and its updated belief about the information item. Through training using our framework, we demonstrate that the Advisor can significantly enhance the performance of various Receivers across a range of tasks. We theoretically analyze our persuasion framework and provide an upper bound on the Advisor's regret, confirming its effectiveness in learning the optimal signaling strategy. Our Empirical results demonstrates that GPT-2 can significantly improve the performance of various models, achieving an average enhancement of 16.1% in mathematical reasoning ability and 13.7% in code generation. We hope our work can provide an initial step toward rethinking the alignment framework from the Bayesian Persuasion perspective.",2024,,,,,,,,201,#7636,Bai 2024,,,0
Large Language Models for Social Determinants of Health Information Extraction from Clinical Notes - A Generalizable Approach across Institutions,"Keloth, V.K.; Selek, S.; Chen, Q.; Liu, H.; Xu, H.","The consistent and persuasive evidence illustrating the influence of social determinants on health has prompted a growing realization throughout the health care sector that enhancing health and health equity will likely depend, at least to some extent, on addressing detrimental social determinants. However, detailed social determinants of health (SDoH) information is often buried within clinical narrative text in electronic health records (EHRs), necessitating natural language processing (NLP) methods to automatically extract these details. Most current NLP efforts for SDoH extraction have been limited, investigating on limited types of SDoH elements, deriving data from a single institution, focusing on specific patient cohorts or note types, with reduced focus on generalizability. This study aims to address these issues by creating cross-institutional corpora spanning different note types and healthcare systems, and developing and evaluating the generalizability of classification models, including novel large language models (LLMs), for detecting SDoH factors from diverse types of notes from four institutions: Harris County Psychiatric Center, University of Texas Physician Practice, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Mayo Clinic. Four corpora of deidentified clinical notes were annotated with 21 SDoH factors at two levels: level 1 with SDoH factor types only and level 2 with SDoH factors along with associated values. Three traditional classification algorithms (XGBoost, TextCNN, Sentence BERT) and an instruction tuned LLM-based approach (LLaMA) were developed to identify multiple SDoH factors. Substantial variation was noted in SDoH documentation practices and label distributions based on patient cohorts, note types, and hospitals. The LLM achieved top performance with micro-averaged F1 scores over 0.9 on level 1 annotated corpora and an F1 over 0.84 on level 2 annotated corpora. While models performed well when trained and tested on individual datasets, cross-dataset generalization highlighted remaining obstacles. To foster collaboration, access to partial annotated corpora and models trained by merging all annotated datasets will be made available on the PhysioNet repository.",2024,,,,,,,,203,#7638,Keloth 2024,,,0
Investigating Persuasion Techniques in Arabic: An Empirical Study Leveraging Large Language Models,"Alzahrani, A.; Babkier, E.; Yanbaawi, F.; Alhuzali, H.","In the current era of digital communication and widespread use of social media, it is crucial to develop an understanding of persuasive techniques employed in written text. This knowledge is essential for effectively discerning accurate information and making informed decisions. To address this need, this paper presents a comprehensive empirical study focused on identifying persuasive techniques in Arabic social media content. To achieve this objective, we utilize Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and leverage the ArAlEval dataset, which encompasses two tasks: binary classification to determine the presence or absence of persuasion techniques, and multi-label classification to identify the specific types of techniques employed in the text. Our study explores three different learning approaches by harnessing the power of PLMs: feature extraction, fine-tuning, and prompt engineering techniques. Through extensive experimentation, we find that the fine-tuning approach yields the highest results on the aforementioned dataset, achieving an f1-micro score of 0.865 and an f1-weighted score of 0.861. Furthermore, our analysis sheds light on an interesting finding. While the performance of the GPT model is relatively lower compared to the other approaches, we have observed that by employing few-shot learning techniques, we can enhance its results by up to 20%.

LLM-Generated Black-box Explanations Can Be Adversarially Helpful,"Ajwani, R.; Javaji, S.R.; Rudzicz, F.; Zhu, Z.","Large language models (LLMs) are becoming vital tools that help us solve and understand complex problems. LLMs can generate convincing explanations, even when given only the inputs and outputs of these problems, i.e., in a “black-box” approach. However, our research uncovers a hidden risk tied to this approach, which we call adversarial helpfulness. This happens when an LLM’s explanations make a wrong answer look correct, potentially leading people to trust faulty solutions. In this paper, we show that this issue affects not just humans, but also LLM evaluators. Digging deeper, we identify and examine key persuasive strategies employed by LLMs. Our findings reveal that these models employ strategies such as reframing questions, expressing an elevated level of confidence, and ‘cherry-picking’ evidence that supports incorrect answers. We further create a symbolic graph reasoning task to analyze the mechanisms of LLMs generating adversarial helpfulness explanations. Most LLMs are not able to find alternative paths along simple graphs, indicating that other mechanisms, rather than logical deductions, might facilitate adversarial helpfulness. These findings shed light on the limitations of black-box explanations and lead to recommendations for the safer use of LLMs.",2024,,,,,,,,205,#7640,Ajwani 2024,,,0
Impact of Tone-Aware Explanations in Recommender Systems,"Okoso, A.; Otaki, K.; Koide, S.; Baba, Y.","In recommender systems, the presentation of explanations plays a crucial role in supporting users’ decision-making processes. Although numerous existing studies have focused on the effects (transparency or persuasiveness) of explanation content, explanation expression is largely overlooked. Tone, such as formal and humorous, is directly linked to expressiveness and is an important element in human communication. However, studies on the impact of tone on explanations within the context of recommender systems are insufficient. Therefore, this study investigates the effect of explanation tones through an online user study from three aspects: perceived effects, domain differences, and user attributes. We create a dataset using a large language model to generate fictional items and explanations with various tones in the domain of movies, hotels, and home products. Collected data analysis reveals different perceived effects of tones depending on the domains. Moreover, user attributes such as age and personality traits are found to influence the impact of tone. This research underscores the critical role of tones in explanations within recommender systems, suggesting that attention to tone can enhance user experience.",2024,,,,,,,,206,#7641,Okoso 2024,,,0
Large Language Models as Instruments of Power: New Regimes of Autonomous Manipulation and Control,"Chaudhary, Y.; Penn, J.","Large language models (LLMs) can reproduce a wide variety of rhetorical styles and generate text that expresses a broad spectrum of sentiments. This capacity, now available at low cost, makes them powerful tools for manipulation and control. In this paper, we consider a set of underestimated societal harms made possible by the rapid and largely unregulated adoption of LLMs. Rather than consider LLMs as isolated digital artefacts used to displace this or that area of work, we focus on the large-scale computational infrastructure upon which they are instrumentalised across domains. We begin with discussion on how LLMs may be used to both pollute and uniformize information environments and how these modalities may be leveraged as mechanisms of control. We then draw attention to several areas of emerging research, each of which compounds the capabilities of LLMs as instruments of power. These include (i) persuasion through the real-time design of choice architectures in conversational interfaces (e.g., via “AI personas”), (ii) the use of LLM-agents as computational models of human agents (e.g., “silicon subjects”), (iii) the use of LLM-agents as computational models of human agent populations (e.g., “silicon societies”) and finally, (iv) the combination of LLMs with reinforcement learning to produce controllable and steerable strategic dialogue models. We draw these strands together to discuss how these areas may be combined to build LLM-based systems that serve as powerful instruments of individual, social and political control via the simulation and disingenuous ""prediction"" of human behaviour, intent, and action.",2024,,,,,,,,207,#7642,Chaudhary 2024,,,0
Can Nuanced Language Lead to More Actionable Insights? Exploring the Role of Generative AI in Analytical Narrative Structure,"Setlur, V.; Birnbaum, L.","Relevant language describing trends in data can be useful for generating summaries to help with readers' takeaways. However, the language employed in these often template-generated summaries tends to be simple, ranging from describing simple statistical information (e.g., extrema and trends) without additional context and richer language to provide actionable insights. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in capturing subtle nuances in language when describing information. This workshop paper specifically explores how LLMs can provide more actionable insights when describing trends by focusing on three dimensions of analytical narrative structure: semantic, rhetorical, and pragmatic. Building on prior research that examines visual and linguistic signatures for univariate line charts, we examine how LLMs can further leverage the semantic dimension of analytical narratives using quantified semantics to describe shapes in trends as people intuitively view them. These semantic descriptions help convey insights in a way that leads to a pragmatic outcome, i.e., a call to action, persuasion, warning vs. alert, and situational awareness. Finally, we identify rhetorical implications for how well these generated narratives align with the perceived shape of the data, thereby empowering users to make informed decisions and take meaningful actions based on these data insights.",2024,,,,,,,,208,#7643,Setlur 2024,,,0
Can a Hallucinating Model help in Reducing Human “Hallucination”?,"Sundaram, S.S.; Alwar, B.","The prevalence of unwarranted beliefs, spanning pseudoscience, logical fallacies, and conspiracy theories, presents substantial societal hurdles and the risk of disseminating misinformation. Utilizing established psychometric assessments, this study explores the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) vis-a-vis the average human in detecting prevalent logical pitfalls. We undertake a philosophical inquiry, juxtaposing the rationality of humans against that of LLMs. Furthermore, we propose methodologies for harnessing LLMs to counter misconceptions, drawing upon psychological models of persuasion such as cognitive dissonance theory and elaboration likelihood theory. Through this endeavor, we highlight the potential of LLMs as personalized misinformation debunking agents.",2024,,,,,,,,210,#7645,Sundaram 2024,,,0
Using Deep Q-Learning to Dynamically Toggle between Push/Pull Actions in Computational Trust Mechanisms,"Lygizou, Z.; Kalles, D.","Recent work on decentralized computational trust models for open Multi Agent Systems has resulted in the development of CA, a biologically inspired model which focuses on the trustee’s perspective. This new model addresses a serious unresolved problem in existing trust and reputation models, namely the inability to handle constantly changing behaviors and agents’ continuous entry and exit from the system. In previous work, we compared CA to FIRE, a well-known trust and reputation model, and found that CA is superior when the trustor population changes, whereas FIRE is more resilient to the trustee population changes. Thus, in this paper, we investigate how the trustors can detect the presence of several dynamic factors in their environment and then decide which trust model to employ in order to maximize utility. We frame this problem as a machine learning problem in a partially observable environment, where the presence of several dynamic factors is not known to the trustor and we describe how an adaptable trustor can rely on a few measurable features so as to assess the current state of the environment and then use Deep Q Learning (DQN), in a single-agent Reinforcement Learning setting, to learn how to adapt to a changing environment. We ran a series of simulation experiments to compare the performance of the adaptable trustor with the performance of trustors using only one model (FIRE or CA) and we show that an adaptable agent is indeed capable of learning when to use each model and, thus, perform consistently in dynamic environments.",2024,,,,,,,,211,#7646,Lygizou 2024,,,0
HOW TO PARAMETERIZE ASYMMETRIC QUANTIZATION RANGES FOR QUANTIZATION-AWARE TRAINING,"You, J.; Park, M.; Lee, K.; Patel, C.; Nagel, M.","This paper investigates three different parameterizations of asymmetric uniform quantization for quantization-aware training: (1) scale and offset, (2) minimum and maximum, and (3) beta and gamma. We perform a comprehensive comparative analysis of these parameterizations’ influence on quantization-aware training, using both controlled experiments and real-world large language models. Our particular focus is on their changing behavior in response to critical training hyper-parameters, bit width and learning rate. Based on our investigation, we propose best practices to stabilize and accelerate quantization-aware training with learnable asymmetric quantization ranges.",2024,,,,,,,,212,#7647,You 2024,,,0
The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,"Gabriel, I.; Manzini, A.; Keeling, G.; Isaac, W.; Manyika, J.","This paper focuses on the opportunities and the ethical and societal risks posed by advanced AI assistants. We define advanced AI assistants as artificial agents with natural language interfaces, whose function is to plan and execute sequences of actions on behalf of a user – across one or more domains – in line with the user’s expectations. The paper starts by considering the technology itself, providing an overview of AI assistants, their technical foundations and potential range of applications. It then explores questions around AI value alignment, well-being, safety and malicious uses. Extending the circle of inquiry further, we next consider the relationship between advanced AI assistants and individual users in more detail, exploring topics such as manipulation and persuasion, anthropomorphism, appropriate relationships, trust and privacy. With this analysis in place, we consider the deployment of advanced assistants at a societal scale, focusing on cooperation, equity and access, misinformation, economic impact, the environment and how best to evaluate advanced AI assistants.

A Mechanism-Based Approach to Mitigating Harms from Persuasive Generative AI,"El-Sayed, S.; Akbulut, C.; McCroskery, A.; Everitt, T.; Brown, S.","Recent generative AI systems have demonstrated more advanced persuasive capabilities and are increasingly permeating areas of life where they can influence decision-making. Generative AI presents a new risk profile of persuasion due the opportunity for reciprocal exchange and prolonged interactions. This has led to growing concerns about harms from AI persuasion and how they can be mitigated, highlighting the need for a systematic study of AI persuasion. The current definitions of AI persuasion are unclear and related harms are insufficiently studied. Existing harm mitigation approaches prioritise harms from the outcome of persuasion over harms from the process of persuasion. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the systematic study of AI persuasion. We first put forward definitions of persuasive generative AI. We distinguish between rationally persuasive generative AI, which relies on providing relevant facts, sound reasoning, or other forms of trustworthy evidence, and manipulative generative AI, which relies on taking advantage of cognitive biases and heuristics or misrepresenting information. We also put forward a map of harms from AI persuasion, including definitions and examples of economic, physical, environmental, psychological, sociocultural, political, privacy, and autonomy harm. We then introduce a map of mechanisms that contribute to harmful persuasion. Lastly, we provide an overview of approaches that can be used to mitigate against process harms of persuasion, including prompt engineering for manipulation classification and red teaming. Future work will operationalise these mitigations and study the interaction between different types of mechanisms of persuasion.",2024,,,,,,,,214,#7649,El-Sayed 2024,,,0
Human-in-the-loop Learning for Dynamic Congestion Games,"Li, H.; Duan, L.","Today mobile users learn and share their traffic observations via crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Google Maps and Waze). Yet such platforms simply cater to selfish users’ myopic interests to recommend the shortest path, and do not encourage enough users to travel and learn other paths for future others. Prior studies focus on one-shot congestion games without considering users’ information learning, while our work studies how users learn and alter traffic conditions on stochastic paths in a human-in-the-loop manner. In a typical parallel routing network with one deterministic path and multiple stochastic paths, our analysis shows that the myopic routing policy (used by Google Maps and Waze) leads to severe under-exploration of stochastic paths. This results in a price of anarchy (PoA) greater than 2, as compared to the socially optimal policy achieved through optimal exploration-exploitation tradeoff in minimizing the long-term social cost. Besides, the myopic policy fails to ensure the correct learning convergence about users’ traffic hazard beliefs. To address this, we focus on informational (non-monetary) mechanisms as they are easier to implement than pricing. We first show that existing information-hiding mechanisms and deterministic path-recommendation mechanisms in Bayesian persuasion literature do not work with even PoA = ∞. Accordingly, we propose a new combined hiding and probabilistic recommendation (CHAR) mechanism to hide all information from a selected user group and provide state-dependent probabilistic recommendations to the other user group. Our CHAR mechanism successfully ensures PoA less than 45 , which cannot be further reduced by any other informational (non-monetary) mechanism. Besides the parallel network, we further extend our analysis and CHAR mechanism to more general linear path graphs with multiple intermediate nodes, and we prove that the PoA results remain unchanged. Additionally, we carry out experiments with real-world datasets to further extend our routing graphs and verify the close-to-optimal performance of our CHAR mechanism.",2024,,,,,,,,215,#7650,Li 2024,,,0
A biologically inspired computational trust model for open multi-agent systems which is resilient to trustor population changes,"Lygizou, Z.; Kalles, D.","Current trust and reputation models continue to have significant limitations, such as the inability to deal with agents constantly entering or exiting open multi-agent systems (open MAS), as well as continuously changing behaviors. Our study is based on CA, a previously proposed decentralized computational trust model from the trustee's point of view, inspired by synaptic plasticity and the formation of assemblies in the human brain. It is designed to meet the requirements of highly dynamic and open MAS, and its main difference with most conventional trust and reputation models is that the trustor does not select a trustee to delegate a task; instead, the trustee determines whether it is qualified to successfully execute it. We ran a series of simulations to compare CA model to FIRE, a well-established, decentralized trust and reputation model for open MAS, under conditions of continuous trustee and trustor population replacement, as well as continuous change of trustees' abilities to perform tasks. The main finding is that FIRE is superior to changes in the trustee population, whereas CA is resilient to the trustor population changes. When the trustees switch performance profiles FIRE clearly outperforms despite the fact that both models' performances are significantly impacted by this environmental change. Findings lead us to conclude that learning to use the appropriate trust model, according to the dynamic conditions in effect could maximize the trustor's benefits.",2024,,,,,,,,219,#7654,Lygizou 2024,,,0

Sustenance Maintenance and Ailment Redressal System,"Kumar, N.; Tiwari, S.; Poria, S.; Kumar, A.; Tripathi, A.","The study proposes a conceptual model of chatbot in healthcare in accordance with the Indian perspective. The traditional healthcare system that focuses on curing illnesses is well known but less talked about nowadays. We will discuss the possibilities and analyze the other research to date to obtain a persuasive, inclusive, vigilant, and smart solution. The model hence proposed we named as Sustenance Maintenance and Ailment Redressal System (SMARS). The above-coined model will be used explicitly to monitor health, detect illnesses early, and suggest healthcare methods. This system will record the health vitals on daily bases, which will help in future needs. This system will suggest doctors for check-ups of illnesses which is a very time-effective process. Moreover, this system provides a healthcare solution that is reliable, costeffective, and easily adaptable to the persisting system. Chatbot interactions in real-time are a very useful tool for health care and it should be not only useful but usual also. A variety of health issues can be addressed in real-time. Chatbot may suggest homemade remedies and quick first aid procedures for curing health at home. This paper is based on analyzing the prior research and finding the possibilities of integrating the existing system with an advanced technological tool that provides suggestions on Ayurvedic healthcare based on data and algorithms. It also combines modern technology with traditional Ayurvedic principles to offer personalized recommendations for different illnesses and healthcare conditions by using a vast database of Ayurvedic knowledge and algorithms to analyze various factors such as the individual's health condition, symptoms, dosha constitution, and lifestyle.

IITK at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Hierarchical Embeddings for Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Memes,"Chikoti, S.; Mehta, S.; Modi, A.","Memes are one of the most popular types of content used in an online disinformation campaign. They are primarily effective on social media platforms since they can easily reach many users. Memes in a disinformation campaign achieve their goal of influencing the users through several rhetorical and psychological techniques, such as causal oversimplification, name-calling, and smear. The SemEval 2024 Task 4 Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Technique in Memes on identifying such techniques in the memes is divided across three sub-tasks: (1) Hierarchical multi-label classification using only textual content of the meme, (2) Hierarchical multi-label classification using both, textual and visual content of the meme and (3) Binary classification of whether the meme contains a persuasion technique or not using it’s textual and visual content. This paper proposes an ensemble of Class Definition Prediction (CDP) and hyperbolic embeddings-based approaches for this task. We enhance meme classification accuracy and comprehensiveness by integrating HypEmo’s hierarchical label embeddings (Chen et al., 2023) and a multi-task learning framework for emotion prediction.

Utilizing LLMs for Enhanced Argumentation and Extraction of Causal Knowledge from Scientific Literature,"Wang, S.; Chen, W.; Zhang, Y.; Chen, T.; Du, J.","Current semantic extraction tools have limited performance in identifying causal relations, neglecting variations in argument quality, especially persuasive strength across different sentences. The present study proposes a five-element based (evidence cogency, concept, relation stance, claim-context relevance, conditional information) causal knowledge mining framework and automatically implements it using large language models (LLMs) to improve the understanding of disease causal mechanisms. As a result, regarding cogency evaluation, the accuracy (0.84) of the fine-tuned Llama2-7b largely exceeds the accuracy of GPT-3.5 turbo with few-shot. Regarding causal extraction, by combining PubTator and ChatGLM, the entity first-relation later extraction (recall, 0.85) outperforms the relation first-entity later means (recall, 0.76), performing great in three outer validation sets (a gestational diabetes-relevant dataset and two general biomedical datasets), aligning entities for further causal graph construction.

Hatred Stems from Ignorance! Distillation of the Persuasion Modes in Countering Conversational Hate Speech,"Alyahya, G.; Aldayel, A.","Examining the factors that the counterspeech uses are at the core of understanding the optimal methods for confronting hate speech online. Various studies have assessed the emotional base factors used in counter speech, such as emotional empathy, offensiveness, and hostility. To better understand the counterspeech used in conversations, this study distills persuasion modes into reason, emotion, and credibility and evaluates their use in two types of conversation interactions: closed (multi-turn) and open (single-turn) concerning racism, sexism, and religious bigotry. The evaluation covers the distinct behaviors seen with human-sourced as opposed to machine-generated counterspeech. It also assesses the interplay between the stance taken and the mode of persuasion seen in the counterspeech. Notably, we observe nuanced differences in the counterspeech persuasion modes used in open and closed interactions—especially in terms of the topic, with a general tendency to use reason as a persuasion mode to express the counterpoint to hate comments. The machine-generated counterspeech tends to exhibit an emotional persuasion mode, while human counters lean toward reason. Furthermore, our study shows that reason tends to obtain more supportive replies than other persuasion modes. The findings highlight the potential for incorporating persuasion modes into studies about countering hate speech, as they can serve as an optimal means of explainability and pave the way for the further adoption of the reply’s stance and the role it plays in assessing what comprises the optimal counterspeech.",2024,,,,,,,,231,#7665,Alyahya 2024,,,0

Classification of cyberbullying in social media using Natural Language Programming method,"Vivekananth, P.; Sharma, N.","The evolution of internet describes the usage of Social Media (SM) which expands drastically. This involvement continues to increase in context with the current global epidemic since people frequently use SM platforms to vent their feelings. Similarly, the widespread adoption of SM sites like Facebook and Twitter by many organizations has raised the volume of essential individual input regarding the state of affairs, events, goods, and services. One of the major drawbacks that widespread SM usage is cyberbullying. The frequency of cyberbullying on SM platforms has raised serious concerns for people, organizations, and society at large. To minimize negative impacts due to cyberbullying on SM, early detection is essential. As a result, Sentiment Analysis (SA) utilizing Twitter data has gained prominence. Text analysis-related Natural Language Processing (NLP) and in Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies have gained increased attention because of increasing demand for SM analysis. Moreover, the important fields utilized to proactively extract and train high-quality characteristics from low-level text involved is Machine Learning (ML).

Generalized Principal-Agent Problem with a Learning Agent,"Lin, T.; Chen, Y.","Classic principal-agent problems such as Stackelberg games, contract design, and Bayesian persuasion, often assume that the agent is able to best respond to the principal's committed strategy. We study repeated generalized principal-agent problems under the assumption that the principal does not have commitment power and the agent uses algorithms to learn to respond to the principal. We reduce this problem to a one-shot generalized principal-agent problem where the agent approximately best responds. Using this reduction, we show that: (1) If the agent uses contextual no-regret learning algorithms with regret Reg(T), then the principal can guarantee utility at least (Equation presented) where U ∗ is the principal's optimal utility in the classic model with a best-responding agent. (2) If the agent uses contextual no-swap-regret learning algorithms with swap-regret SReg(T), then the principal cannot obtain utility more than U ∗ + O(SReg(T)T ). But (3) if the agent uses mean-based learning algorithms (which can be no-regret but not no-swap-regret), then the principal can sometimes do significantly better than U ∗. These results not only refine previous results in Stackelberg games and contract design, but also lead to new results for Bayesian persuasion with a learning agent and all generalized principal-agent problems where the agent does not have private information.",2024,,,,,,,,240,#7674,Lin 2024,,,0
"Persuasion, Delegation, and Private Information in Algorithm-Assisted Decisions","Xu, R.","A principal designs an algorithm that generates a publicly observable prediction of a binary state. She must decide whether to act directly based on the prediction or to delegate the decision to an agent with private information but potential misalignment. We study the optimal design of the prediction algorithm and the delegation rule in such environments. Three key findings emerge: (1) Delegation is optimal if and only if the principal would make the same binary decision as the agent had she observed the agent’s information. (2) Providing the most informative algorithm may be suboptimal even if the principal can act on the algorithm’s prediction. Instead, the optimal algorithm may provide more information about one state and restrict information about the other. (3) Common restrictions on algorithms, such as keeping a “human-in-the-loop” or requiring maximal prediction accuracy, strictly worsen decision quality in the absence of perfectly aligned agents and state-revealing signals. These findings predict the underperformance of human-machine collaborations if no measures are taken to mitigate common preference misalignment between algorithms and human decision-makers.",2024,,,,,,,,241,#7675,Xu 2024,,,0

We evaluate our method using a unique dataset generated by a proprietary system that automates target reconnaissance and spear-phishing email creation. Our method achieves a 91% F1 score in identifying LLM-generated spear-phishing emails, with the training set comprising only traditional phishing and benign emails.

Multi-Sender Persuasion: A Computational Perspective,"Hossain, S.; Wang, T.; Lin, T.; Parkes, D.C.; Xu, H.","We consider the multi-sender persuasion problem: multiple players with informational advantage signal to convince a single self-interested actor to take certain actions. This problem generalizes the seminal Bayesian Persuasion framework and is ubiquitous in computational economics, multiagent learning, and multi-objective machine learning. The core solution concept here is the Nash equilibrium of senders’ signaling policies. Theoretically, we prove that finding an equilibrium in general is PPAD-Hard; in fact, even computing a sender’s best response is NP-Hard. Given these intrinsic difficulties, we turn to finding local Nash equilibria. We propose a novel differentiable neural network to approximate this game’s non-linear and discontinuous utilities. Complementing this with the extra-gradient algorithm, we discover local equilibria that Pareto dominates full-revelation equilibria and those found by existing neural networks. Broadly, our theoretical and empirical contributions are of interest to a large class of economic problems.",2024,,,,,,,,247,#7681,Hossain 2024,,,0

We introduce Shadowcast, a stealthy data poisoning attack where poison samples are visually indistinguishable from benign images with matching texts. Shadowcast demonstrates effectiveness in two attack types. The first is a traditional Label Attack, tricking VLMs into misidentifying class labels, such as confusing Donald Trump for Joe Biden. The second is a novel Persuasion Attack, leveraging VLMs’ text generation capabilities to craft persuasive and seemingly rational narratives for misinformation, such as portraying junk food as healthy. We show that Shadowcast effectively achieves the attacker’s intentions using as few as 50 poison samples. Crucially, the poisoned samples demonstrate transferability across different VLM architectures, posing a significant concern in black-box settings. Moreover, Shadowcast remains potent under realistic conditions involving various text prompts, training data augmentation, and image compression techniques. This work reveals how poisoned VLMs can disseminate convincing yet deceptive misinformation to everyday, benign users, emphasizing the importance of data integrity for responsible VLM deployments.

Can LLMs Replace Economic Choice Prediction Labs? The Case of Language-based Persuasion Games,"Shapira, E.; Madmon, O.; Tennenholtz, M.; Reichart, R.","Human choice prediction in economic contexts is crucial for applications in marketing, finance, public policy, and more. This task, however, is often constrained by the difficulties in acquiring human choice data. With most experimental economics studies focusing on simple choice settings, the AI community has explored whether LLMs can substitute for humans in these predictions and examined more complex experimental economics settings. However, a key question remains: can LLMs generate training data for human choice prediction? We explore this in language-based persuasion games, a complex economic setting involving natural language in strategic interactions. Our experiments show that models trained on LLMgenerated data can effectively predict human behavior in these games and even outperform models trained on actual human data.1",2024,,,,,,,,249,#7683,Shapira 2024,,,0
Multiscale Parallel Tempering for Fast Sampling on Redistricting Plans,"Chuang, G.; Herschlag, G.; Mattingly, J.","When auditing a redistricting plan, a persuasive method is to compare the plan with an ensemble of neutrally drawn redistricting plans. Ensembles are generated via algorithms that sample distributions on balanced graph partitions. To audit the partisan difference between the ensemble and a given plan, one must ensure that the non-partisan criteria are matched so that we may conclude that partisan differences come from bias rather than, for example, levels of compactness or differences in community preservation. Certain sampling algorithms allow one to explicitly state the policy-based probability distribution on plans, however, these algorithms have shown poor mixing times for large graphs (i.e. redistricting spaces) for all but a few specialized measures. In this work, we generate a multiscale parallel tempering approach that makes local moves at each scale. The local moves allow us to adopt a wide variety of policy-based measures. We examine our method in the state of Connecticut and succeed at achieving fast mixing on a policy-based distribution that has never before been sampled at this scale. Our algorithm shows promise to expand to a significantly wider class of measures that will (i) allow for more principled and situation-based comparisons and (ii) probe for the typical partisan impact that policy can have on redistricting.MSC Codes 60J10, 91G60",2024,,,,,,,,250,#7684,Chuang 2024,,,0
A Deep Learning Representation of Spatial Interaction Model for Resilient Spatial Planning of Community Business Clusters,"Hao, H.; Wang, Y.","The increasing risks posed by adverse events, such as extreme climatic events and pandemics, have negatively impacted the vitality of community businesses. These challenges necessitate resilient strategies to empower community businesses to adapt to the various adversities. For example, scholars have advocated for improved spatial planning to accommodate customers’ changing behaviors during adverse events. However, existing Spatial Interaction Models (SIMs) are limited in capturing the complex and context-aware interactions between business clusters and trade areas. To address this limitation, we propose a SIM-GAT model to predict spatio-temporal visitation flows between community business clusters and their trade areas. The model innovatively represents the integrated system of business clusters, trade areas, and transportation infrastructure within an urban region using a connected graph. Then, a graph-based deep learning model, i.e., Graph AttenTion network (GAT), is used to capture the complexity and interdependencies of business clusters. We developed this model with data collected from the Miami metropolitan area in Florida. We then demonstrated its effectiveness in capturing varying attractiveness of business clusters to different residential neighborhoods and across scenarios with an eXplainable AI approach. We contribute a novel method supplementing conventional SIMs to predict and analyze the dynamics of inter-connected community business clusters. The analysis results can inform data-evidenced and place-specific planning strategies helping community business clusters better accommodate their customers across scenarios, and hence improve the resilience of community businesses.",2024,,,,,,,,256,#7690,Hao 2024,,,0
Human Delegation Behavior in Human-AI Collaboration: The Effect of Contextual Information,"Spitzer, P.; Holstein, J.; Hemmer, P.; Martin, D.; Satzger, G.","The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human decision-making processes at the workplace presents both opportunities and challenges. One promising approach to leverage existing complementary capabilities is allowing humans to delegate individual instances of decision tasks to AI. However, enabling humans to delegate instances effectively requires them to assess several factors. One key factor is the analysis of both their own capabilities and those of the AI in the context of the given task. In this work, we conduct a behavioral study to explore the effects of providing contextual information to support this delegation decision. Specifically, we investigate how contextual information about the AI and the task domain influence humans’ delegation decisions to an AI and their impact on the human-AI team performance. Our findings reveal that access to contextual information significantly improves human-AI team performance in delegation settings. Finally, we show that the delegation behavior changes with the different types of contextual information. Overall, this research advances the understanding of computer-supported, collaborative work and provides actionable insights for designing more effective collaborative systems.",2024,,,,,,,,257,#7691,Spitzer 2024,,,0
LMRL Gym: Benchmarks for Multi-Turn Reinforcement Learning with Language Models,"Abdulhai, M.; White, I.; Snell, C.; Xu, K.; Levine, S.","Large language models (LLMs) provide excellent text-generation capabilities, but standard prompting and generation methods generally do not lead to intentional or goal-directed agents and might necessitate considerable prompt tuning. This becomes particularly apparent in multi-turn conversations: even the best current LLMs rarely ask clarifying questions, engage in explicit information gathering, or take actions now that lead to better decisions after multiple turns. Reinforcement learning has the potential to leverage the powerful modeling capabilities of LLMs, as well as their internal representation of textual interactions, to create capable goal-directed language agents. This can enable intentional and temporally extended interactions, such as with humans, through coordinated persuasion and carefully crafted questions, or in goal-directed play through text games to bring about desired final outcomes. However, enabling this requires the community to develop stable and reliable reinforcement learning algorithms that can effectively train LLMs. Developing such algorithms requires tasks that can gauge progress on algorithm design, provide accessible and reproducible evaluations for multi-turn interactions, and cover a range of task properties and challenges in improving reinforcement learning algorithms. Our paper introduces the LMRL-Gym benchmark for evaluating multi-turn RL for LLMs, together with an open-source research framework containing a basic toolkit for getting started on multi-turn RL with offline value-based and policy-based RL methods. Our benchmark consists of 8 different language tasks, which require multiple rounds of language interaction and cover a range of tasks in open-ended dialogue and text games.",2023,,,,,,,,260,#7694,Abdulhai 2023,,,0
Algorithmic Persuasion Through Simulation,"Harris, K.; Immorlica, N.; Lucier, B.; Slivkins, A.","We study a Bayesian persuasion game where a sender wants to persuade a receiver to take a binary action, such as purchasing a product. The sender is informed about the (real-valued) state of the world, such as the quality of the product, but only has limited information about the receiver’s beliefs and utilities. Motivated by customer surveys, user studies, and recent advances in AI, we allow the sender to learn more about the receiver by querying an oracle that simulates the receiver’s behavior. After a fixed number of queries, the sender commits to a messaging policy and the receiver takes the action that maximizes her expected utility given the message she receives. We characterize the sender’s optimal messaging policy given any distribution over receiver types. We then design a polynomial-time querying algorithm that optimizes the sender’s expected utility in this game. We also consider approximate oracles, more general query structures, and costly queries.",2023,,,,,,,,261,#7695,Harris 2023,,,0
GraphPro: Graph Pre-training and Prompt Learning for Recommendation,"Yang, Y.; Xia, L.; Luo, D.; Lin, K.; Huang, C.","GNN-based recommendation systems have excelled at capturing complex user-item interactions through multi-hop message passing. Nevertheless, these methods often fail to account for the dynamic nature of user-item interactions, leading to challenges in adapting to changes in user preferences and the distribution of new data. Consequently, their scalability and performance in real-world dynamic settings are constrained. In our study, we introduce GraphPro, a framework that merges dynamic graph pre-training with prompt learning in a parameter-efficient manner. This innovative blend enables GNNs to adeptly grasp both enduring user preferences and transient behavior changes, thereby providing precise and up-to-date recommendations. GraphPro tackles the issue of changing user preferences through the integration of a temporal prompt mechanism and a graph-structural prompt learning mechanism into the pre-trained GNN architecture. The temporal prompt mechanism imprints time-related information onto user-item interactions, equipping the model to inherently assimilate temporal dynamics, while the graph-structural prompt learning mechanism allows for the application of pre-trained insights to new behavior dynamics without continuous retraining. We also introduce a dynamic evaluation framework for recommendations to better reflect real-world situations and narrow the offline-online discrepancy. Our comprehensive experiments, including deployment in a large-scale industrial context, demonstrate the effortless plug-in scalability of GraphPro alongside various leading recommenders, underscoring the superiority of GraphPro in effectiveness, robustness, and efficiency. The implementation details and source code of our GraphPro are available in the repository at https://github.com/HKUDS/GraphPro.",2023,,,,,,,,262,#7696,Yang 2023,,,0
The Adoption and Efficacy of Large Language Models: Evidence From Consumer Complaints in the Financial Industry,"Shin, M.; Kim, J.; Shin, J.","Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping consumer decision-making, particularly in communication with firms, yet our understanding of their impact remains limited. This research explores the effect of LLMs on consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2015 to 2024, documenting the adoption of LLMs for drafting complaints and evaluating the likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms. We analyzed over 1 million complaints and identified a significant increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. We find that LLM usage is associated with an increased likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms. To investigate this relationship, we employ an instrumental variable approach to mitigate endogeneity concerns around LLM adoption. Although instrumental variables suggest a potential causal link, they cannot fully capture all unobserved heterogeneity. To further establish this causal relationship, we conducted controlled experiments, which support that LLMs can enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of consumer narratives, thereby increasing the likelihood of obtaining relief. Our findings suggest that facilitating access to LLMs can help firms better understand consumer concerns and level the playing field among consumers. This underscores the importance of policies promoting technological accessibility, enabling all consumers to effectively voice their concerns.",2023,,,,,,,,263,#7697,Shin 2023,,,0
Adaptive Interventions with User-Defined Goals for Health Behavior Change,"Mandyam, A.; Jörke, M.; Denton, W.; Engelhardt, B.E.; Brunskill, E.","Promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors remains a major public health concern, particularly due to their crucial role in preventing chronic conditions such as cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes. Mobile health applications present a promising avenue for low-cost, scalable health behavior change promotion. Researchers are increasingly exploring adaptive algorithms that personalize interventions to each person’s unique context. However, in empirical studies, mobile health applications often suffer from small effect sizes and low adherence rates, particularly in comparison to human coaching. Tailoring advice to a person’s unique goals, preferences, and life circumstances is a critical component of health coaching that has been underutilized in adaptive algorithms for mobile health interventions. To address this, we introduce a new Thompson sampling algorithm that can accommodate personalized reward functions (i.e., goals, preferences, and constraints), while also leveraging data sharing across individuals to more quickly be able to provide effective recommendations. We prove that our modification incurs only a constant penalty on cumulative regret while preserving the sample complexity benefits of data sharing. We present empirical results on synthetic and semi-synthetic physical activity simulators, where in the latter we conducted an online survey to solicit preference data relating to physical activity, which we use to construct realistic reward models that leverages historical data from another study. Our algorithm achieves substantial performance improvements compared to baselines that do not share data or do not optimize for individualized rewards.",2023,,,,,,,,265,#7699,Mandyam 2023,,,0

FLTracer: Accurate Poisoning Attack Provenance in Federated Learning,"Zhang, X.; Liu, Q.; Ba, Z.; Lu, L.; Ren, K.","Federated Learning (FL) is a promising distributed learning approach that enables multiple clients to collaboratively train a shared global model. However, recent studies show that FL is vulnerable to various poisoning attacks, which can degrade the performance of global models or introduce backdoors into them. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive study on prior FL attacks and detection methods. The results show that all existing detection methods are only effective against limited and specific attacks. Most detection methods suffer from high false positives, which lead to significant performance degradation, especially in not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings. To address these issues, we propose FLTracer, the first FL attack provenance framework to accurately detect various attacks and trace the attack time, objective, type, and poisoned location of updates. Different from existing methodologies that rely solely on cross-client anomaly detection, we propose a Kalman filter-based cross-round detection to identify adversaries by seeking the behavior changes before and after the attack. Thus, this makes it resilient to data heterogeneity and is effective even in non-IID settings. To further improve the accuracy of our detection method, we employ four novel features and capture their anomalies with the joint decisions. Extensive evaluations show that FLTracer achieves an average true positive rate of over 96.88% at an average false positive rate of less than 2.67%, significantly outperforming SOTA detection methods.",2023,,,,,,,,270,#7704,Zhang 2023,,,0
Transfusor: Transformer Diffusor for Controllable Human-like Generation of Vehicle Lane Changing Trajectories,"Dong, J.; Chen, S.; Labi, S.","With ongoing development of autonomous driving systems and increasing desire for deployment, researchers continue to seek reliable approaches for ADS systems. The virtual simulation test (VST) has become a prominent approach for testing autonomous driving systems (ADS) and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) due to its advantages of fast execution, low cost, and high repeatability. However, the success of these simulation-based experiments heavily relies on the realism of the testing scenarios. It is needed to create more flexible and high-fidelity testing scenarios in VST in order to increase the safety and reliabilityof ADS and ADAS.To address this challenge, this paper introduces the “Transfusor” model, which leverages the transformer and diffusor models (two cutting-edge deep learning generative technologies). The primary objective of the Transfusor model is to generate highly realistic and controllable human-like lane-changing trajectories in highway scenarios. Extensive experiments were carried out, and the results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively learns the spatiotemporal characteristics of humans’ lane-changing behaviors and successfully generates trajectories that closely mimic real-world human driving. As such, the proposed model can play a critical role of creating more flexible and high-fidelity testing scenarios in the VST, ultimately leading to safer and more reliable ADS and ADAS.",2023,,,,,,,,276,#7710,Dong 2023,,,0
Conditional normative reasoning as a fragment of HOL,"Parent, X.; Benzmüller, C.","We report on the mechanization of (preference-based) conditional normative reasoning. Our focus is on Åqvist’s system E for conditional obligation, and its extensions. Our mechanization is achieved via a shallow semantical embedding in Isabelle/HOL. We consider two possible uses of the framework. The first one is as a tool for meta-reasoning about the considered logic. We employ it for the automated verification of deontic correspondences (broadly conceived) and related matters, analogous to what has been previously achieved for the modal logic cube. The equivalence is automatically verified in one direction, leading from the property to the axiom. The second use is as a tool for assessing ethical arguments. We provide a computer encoding of a well-known paradox (or impossibility theorem) in population ethics, Parfit’s repugnant conclusion. While some have proposed overcoming the impossibility theorem by abandoning the presupposed transitivity of “better than,” our formalisation unveils a less extreme approach, suggesting among other things the option of weakening transitivity suitably rather than discarding it entirely. Whether the presented encoding increases or decreases the attractiveness and persuasiveness of the repugnant conclusion is a question we would like to pass on to philosophy and ethics.MSC Codes 03B60, 03B15, 68T27, 68T30, 68T15",2023,,,,,,,,277,#7711,Parent 2023,,,0
ChatGPT and Persuasive Technologies for the Management and Delivery of Personalized Recommendations in Hotel Hospitality,"Remountakis, M.; Kotis, K.; Kourtzis, B.; Tsekouras, G.E.","Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies, have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision-making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present a pilot experiment with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. We aim to study the impact of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive techniques on user engagement, satisfaction, and conversion rates. The preliminary results demonstrate the potential of these technologies in enhancing the overall guest experience and business performance.

Improving Primary Healthcare Workflow Using Extreme Summarization of Scientific Literature Based on Generative AI,"Stiglic, G.; Kopitar, L.; Gosak, L.; Meyer, P.; Bian, J.","Primary care professionals struggle to keep up to date with the latest scientific literature critical in guiding evidence-based practice related to their daily work. To help solve the above-mentioned problem, we employed generative artificial intelligence techniques based on large-scale language models to summarize abstracts of scientific papers. Our objective is to investigate the potential of generative artificial intelligence in diminishing the cognitive load experienced by practitioners, thus exploring its ability to alleviate mental effort and burden. The study participants were provided with two use cases related to preventive care and behavior change, simulating a search for new scientific literature. The study included 113 university students from Slovenia and the United States randomized into three distinct study groups. The first group was assigned to the full abstracts. The second group was assigned to the short abstracts generated by AI. The third group had the option to select a full abstract in addition to the AI-generated short summary. Each use case study included ten retrieved abstracts. Our research demonstrates that the use of generative AI for literature review is efficient and effective. The time needed to answer questions related to the content of abstracts was significantly lower in groups two and three compared to the first group using full abstracts. The results, however, also show significantly lower accuracy in extracted knowledge in cases where full abstract was not available.

Glamour muscles: Why having a body is not what it means to be embodied,"Beaulieu, S.L.; Kriegman, S.","Embodiment has recently enjoyed renewed consideration as a means to amplify the faculties of smart machines. Proponents of embodiment seem to imply that optimizing for movement in physical space promotes something more than the acquisition of niche capabilities for solving problems in physical space. However, there is nothing in principle which should so distinguish the problem of action selection in physical space from the problem of action selection in more abstract spaces, like that of language. Rather, what makes embodiment persuasive as a means toward higher intelligence is that it promises to capture, but does not actually realize, contingent facts about certain bodies (living intelligence) and the patterns of activity associated with them. These include an active resistance to annihilation and revisable constraints on the processes that make the world intelligible. To be theoretically or practically useful beyond the creation of niche tools, we argue that ""embodiment"" cannot be the trivial fact of a body, nor its movement through space, but the perpetual negotiation of the function, design, and integrity of that body-that is, to participate in what it means to constitute a given body. It follows that computer programs which are strictly incapable of traversing physical space might, under the right conditions, be more embodied than a walking, talking robot.",2023,,,,,,,,281,#7715,Beaulieu 2023,,,0

Towards Explainable Collaborative Filtering with Taste Clusters Learning,"Du, Y.; Lian, J.; Yao, J.; Gao, Y.; Xie, X.","Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely used and effective technique for recommender systems. In recent decades, there have been significant advancements in latent embedding-based CF methods for improved accuracy, such as matrix factorization, neural collaborative filtering, and LightGCN. However, the explainability of these models has not been fully explored. Adding explainability to recommendation models can not only increase trust in the decision-making process, but also have multiple benefits such as providing persuasive explanations for item recommendations, creating explicit profiles for users and items, and assisting item producers in design improvements. In this paper, we propose a neat and effective Explainable Collaborative Filtering (ECF) model that leverages interpretable cluster learning to achieve the two most demanding objectives: (1) Precise - the model should not compromise accuracy in the pursuit of explainability; and (2) Self-explainable - the model’s explanations should truly reflect its decision-making process, not generated from post-hoc methods. The core of ECF is mining taste clusters from user-item interactions and item profiles. We map each user and item to a sparse set of taste clusters, and taste clusters are distinguished by a few representative tags. The user-item preference, users/items’ cluster affiliations, and the generation of taste clusters are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner. Additionally, we introduce a forest mechanism to ensure the model’s accuracy, explainability, and diversity. To comprehensively evaluate the explainability quality of taste clusters, we design several quantitative metrics, including in-cluster item coverage, tag utilization, silhouette, and informativeness.

Applying An Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Electrocardiographic System for Reducing Mortality: A Pragmatic Randomized Clinical Trial,"Lin, C.-S.; Liu, W.-T.; Tsai, D.-J.; Lin, C.; Lin, S.-H.","Background: Intensive care helps to reduce mortality in patients with critical illnesses. However, the early identification of vulnerable patients poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice. Our aim was to evaluate the effectiveness and outcome of an artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled electrocardiogram (ECG) for identifying patients with a high risk of mortality.Methods: For this multisite, single-blind, patient-level randomized controlled trial (NCT05118035), we recruited 39 attending physicians and their patients from the emergency and inpatient departments. The AI-ECG intervention included (1) an AI report in the patients’ electronic health records and (2) an active warning message to physicians for patients with a high risk of mortality. Patients were allocated by the HIS system. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality within 90 days. The secondary analyses included follow-ups of medical behavior changes and causes of death.Findings: The data from 15,965 patients (N = 8,001 intervention; N = 7,964 control) with a mean age of 61±18 years old were included in this study. The cumulative proportion of death was significantly reduced [hazard ratio (HR): 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.70-0.99] in the intervention group (3.6%) compared to the control group (4.3%), primarily in the high-risk cases identified by the AI-ECG (N = 709 intervention; N = 688 control), with a 31% reduction in mortality (16.0% in the intervention arm versus 23.0% in the control arm, HR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.53-0.90; p for interaction of intervention and AI-ECG risk = 0.026). More intensive care unit admissions, arrhythmia interventions, echocardiographic examinations, and electrolyte examinations were performed in the intervention group with high-risk ECGs, which may have contributed to the significant risk reduction of cardiac death (0.2% in the intervention arm versus 2.4% in the control arm, HR: 0.07, 95% CI: 0.01-0.56).Interpretation: An AI-ECG detects patients in peril to instigate intensive care, leading to a reduction of all-cause mortality.Trial Registration: This trial was registered before initiation (ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT05118035).Funding: This study was supported by funding from the National Science and Technology Council, Taiwan (MOST110-2314-B-016- 010-MY3 to Chin Lin), the Cheng Hsin General Hospital, Taiwan (CHNDMC-111-07 to Chin Lin), and the Medical Affairs Bureau, Taiwan (MND-MAB-110-113, MND-MAB-D-111045, and MND-MAB-C13-112050 to Chin Lin).Declaration of Interest: The authors have nothing to disclose.Ethical Approval: This work was ethically approved by the institutional review board at the Tri-Service General Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan (IRB No. A202105120).

Hitachi at SemEval-2023 Task 3: Exploring Cross-lingual Multi-task Strategies for Genre and Framing Detection in Online News,"Koreeda, Y.; Yokote, K.-I.; Ozaki, H.; Tsunokake, M.; Sogawa, Y.","This paper explains the participation of team Hitachi to SemEval-2023 Task 3 “Detecting the genre, the framing, and the persuasion techniques in online news in a multi-lingual setup.” Based on the multilingual, multi-task nature of the task and the low-resource setting, we investigated different cross-lingual and multi-task strategies for training the pretrained language models. Through extensive experiments, we found that (a) cross-lingual/multi-task training, and (b) collecting an external balanced dataset, can benefit the genre and framing detection. We constructed ensemble models from the results and achieved the highest macro-averaged F1 scores in Italian and Russian genre categorization subtasks.",2023,,,,,,,,311,#7745,Koreeda 2023,,,0
Where do pigeons’ choices come from? Transfer Learning in Spiking Neural Networks for Animal Choices in Behavioral Research,"Plessas, A.; Espinosa-Ramos, J.I.; Cowie, S.; Landon, J.; Parry, D.","There is a large body of work in the behavioural psychology literature studying how an organism’s behavior changes in relation to consequences (reinforcement) from the environment. As all behaviors are an outcome of choice, behavioral research focuses on the study of choice behavior. Machine learning (ML) models may assist behavioral research to further understand the mechanisms of choice behavior. However, behavioral psychology datasets can be small and variable, affecting the ML's ability to generalize with new datasets extracted from different populations and/or behavioral experiments and limiting ML's usefulness in this context. Therefore, in this paper, we tested two transfer learning strategies –feature extraction and fine-tuning– to remove the need to retrain ML models for every new dataset. Our approach allowed our state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model to become adaptable to novel instances. Initially, we trained a single spiking neural network (SNN) to identify an organism’s reinforcement history based on five experimental datasets of pigeon binary decision-making. Then we tested two transfer learning strategies by keeping the underlying patterns of the pre-trained SNN the same (i.e., neuron properties and weights) and adapting only the classifier of the outputs (i.e., firing rates) to suit the new datasets. Lastly, we compared the performance of the transfer learning approaches to our baseline SNN model. Our study demonstrated that knowledge gained from a population (baseline model) could be applied to another population’s dataset without retraining the model each time, regardless of which dataset participated in the training or testing of the SNN model. Currently, there is limited use of transfer learning in SNNs and in animal research. Our results may help develop new approaches in the ‘toolbox’ of psychological research to enhance prediction, independent from the dataset, without consuming significant computational resources.",2023,,,,,,,,312,#7746,Plessas 2023,,,0

Causal effect of racial bias in machine learning algorithms affecting user persuasiveness & decision-making: An Empirical Study,"Sengupta, K.; Srivastava, P.R.","Language data and models demonstrate various types of bias, be it ethnic, religious, gender, or socioeconomic. AI/NLP models, when trained on the racially biased dataset, AI/NLP models instigate poor model explainability, influence user experience during decision making, and thus further magnify societal biases, raising profound ethical implications for society. The motivation of the study is to investigate how AI systems imbibe bias introduced in data and further produce unexplainable discriminatory outcomes. This implication of the study will aid in understanding how machine learning models imbibe bias from data and try to influence individuals' articulateness of system outcomes due to bias features. The design of the experiment involves studying the counterfactual impact of racial bias features present in language datasets and its associated effect on the model outcome. A mixed research methodology is adopted to investigate the cross implication of biased model outcome on user experience effect on decision-making through controlled lab experimentation. The findings provide foundation support for correlating the importance of carry-over an artificial intelligence model solving NLP task due to biased concept presented in the dataset. Further, the research outcomes justify the negative influence on users' persuasiveness1 that leads to altering the decision-making quotient of an individual when trying to rely on the model outcome to act. The paper bridges the gap across the harm caused in establishing poor user trustworthiness due to an inequitable system design and provides strong support for researchers, policymakers, and data scientists to build responsible AI frameworks within organizations.",2023,,,,,,,,315,#7749,Sengupta 2023,,,0
Explainable AI in Biomedical Research: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis,"Malinverno, L.; Barros, V.; Ghisoni, F.; Lovrić, M.; Rosen-Zvi, M.","Background: The black-box nature of most artificial intelligence (AI) models encourages the development of explainability methods to engender trust into the AI decision-making process. We aimed to analyze the possible role of Covid-19 in bringing explainable AI (XAI) to the forefront of biomedical research.Methods: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched in the PubMed database for studies published from Jan 1, 2010, to Nov 3, 2022. Biomedical XAI papers were extracted based on a set of pre-defined keywords. We automatically excluded papers that were not related to concepts of causality or explainability and manually labeled 1603 papers with respect to XAI categories that best describe the study. We compared the trends pre- and post- Covid -19 and fit a change point detection model to evaluate significant changes in publication rates.Findings: We found an exponential growth of biomedical XAI papers. Specifically, an inflection period in the publication rate was observed in October 2020, when the quantity of XAI research in biomedical sciences surged upward significantly. When modeling the effect of the changepoint as a shift in time, we observed that such abrupt change would have been observed only 22 months later, had Covid -19 not happened.Interpretation: The advent of Covid -19 in the beginning of 2020 could be the driving factor behind the increased focus concerning XAI, accounting for the several months necessary to analyze data and publish manuscripts. However, our analyses were done based on the review of titles and abstracts of the studies. Establishing the causal nature of this link would require careful mining of the content of these papers.Funding: We acknowledge the funding received from the European Union’s Framework Programme for Research and Innovation Horizon 2020 (2014-2020) under the Marie Skłodowska-Curie Grant Agreement No. 813533-MSCA-ITN-2018.

AI Alignment Dialogues: An Interactive Approach to AI Alignment in Support Agents,"Chen, P.-Y.; Tielman, M.L.; Heylen, D.K.J.; Jonker, C.M.; van Riemsdijk, M.B.","AI alignment is about ensuring AI systems only pursue goals and activities that are beneficial to humans. Most of the current approach to AI alignment is to learn what humans value from their behavioural data. This paper proposes a different way of looking at the notion of alignment, namely by introducing AI Alignment Dialogues: dialogues with which users and agents try to achieve and maintain alignment via interaction. We argue that alignment dialogues have a number of advantages in comparison to data-driven approaches, especially for behaviour support agents, which aim to support users in achieving their desired future behaviours rather than their current behaviours. The advantages of alignment dialogues include allowing the users to directly convey higher-level concepts to the agent, and making the agent more transparent and trustworthy. In this paper we outline the concept and high-level structure of alignment dialogues. Moreover, we conducted a qualitative focus group user study from which we developed a model that describes how alignment dialogues affect users, and created design suggestions for AI alignment dialogues. Through this we establish foundations for AI alignment dialogues and shed light on what requires further development and research.",2023,,,,,,,,319,#7753,Chen 2023,,,0
"UBIWEAR: An end-to-end, data-driven framework for intelligent physical activity prediction to empower mHealth interventions","Bampakis, A.; Yfantidou, S.; Vakali, A.","It is indisputable that physical activity is vital for an individual’s health and wellness. However, a global prevalence of physical inactivity has induced significant personal and socioeconomic implications. In recent years, a significant amount of work has showcased the capabilities of self-tracking technology to create positive health behavior change. This work is motivated by the potential of personalized and adaptive goal-setting techniques in encouraging physical activity via self-tracking. To this end, we propose UBIWEAR, an end-to-end framework for intelligent physical activity prediction, with the ultimate goal to empower data-driven goal-setting interventions. To achieve this, we experiment with numerous machine learning and deep learning paradigms as a robust benchmark for physical activity prediction tasks. To train our models, we utilize, “MyHeart Counts”, an open, large-scale dataset collected in-the-wild from thousands of users. We also propose a prescriptive framework for self-tracking aggregated data preprocessing, to facilitate data wrangling of real-world, noisy data. Our best model achieves a MAE of 1087 steps, 65% lower than the state of the art in terms of absolute error, proving the feasibility of the physical activity prediction task, and paving the way for future research.",2022,,,,,,,,320,#7754,Bampakis 2022,,,0
Claim Optimization in Computational Argumentation,"Skitalinskaya, G.; Spliethöver, M.; Wachsmuth, H.","An optimal delivery of arguments is key to persuasion in any debate, both for humans and for AI systems. This requires the use of clear and fluent claims relevant to the given debate. Prior work has studied the automatic assessment of argument quality extensively. Yet, no approach actually improves the quality so far. To fill this gap, this paper proposes the task of claim optimization: to rewrite argumentative claims in order to optimize their delivery. As multiple types of optimization are possible, we approach this task by first generating a diverse set of candidate claims using a large language model, such as BART, taking into account contextual information. Then, the best candidate is selected using various quality metrics. In automatic and human evaluation on an English-language corpus, our quality-based candidate selection outperforms several baselines, improving 60% of all claims (worsening 16% only). Follow-up analyses reveal that, beyond copy editing, our approach often specifies claims with details, whereas it adds less evidence than humans do. Moreover, its capabilities generalize well to other domains, such as instructional texts.",2022,,,,,,,,321,#7755,Skitalinskaya 2022,,,0
Behaviour change interventions based on automated and tailored communication systems to improve health outcomes in adult chronic patients: a systematic review,"Martins, A.; Londral, A.; Lapão, L.V.","Background: Behaviour change digital-assisted interventions can be a low-cost solution to enduring healthy behaviours. Understanding how to automate and tailor such interventions to patients’ needs can improve health outcomes. This study aims at reviewing the evidence of the use of such interventions in a clinical setting in adult chronic patients. Methods: This study followed the PRISMA guidelines for comprehensive search, appraisal, and synthesis of research evidence. A literature search was performed to find studies published between 1 January 2017 and 26 March 2022 in peer-reviewed journals and written in English. Behaviour change interventions in adult chronic patients with automated and tailored communication systems were considered. Results: Seven quantitative studies (6 RCT and a pilot RCT) with sample sizes from 54 to 506 participants and timeframes varying from 4 to 30 weeks met the eligibility criteria. Populations comprehended patients with cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or osteoarthritis. Communication channels included SMS, email, and voice records. Rule-based models were used to automate content in all studies and bidirectional communication was used in four of them. Content and service delivery were tailored given the patient’s goals, needs, functional ability, activity, personal characteristics, and communication channel preferred. Most data management platforms used were developed in prior studies. Interventions were designed based on 9 different behaviour change models. There was no evidence of improvements in clinical outcomes after the intervention. Some studies showed improvements in self-efficacy (n=1), the use of dietary data info (n=1), physical activity (n=2), social support (n=1), and quality of life (n=1). The risk of bias analysis revealed that one study had moderate risk and the remaining had low risk. Conclusion: This study supports researchers that are designing digital behaviour change interventions by putting in evidence the intervention’s features needed to be considered during this step. It revealed that the most efficient solutions were tailored to patients’ needs and disease stages and that further research on the mechanisms of change and content automation needs to be done.",2022,,,,,,,,325,#7759,Martins 2022,,,0

Generating Persuasive Responses to Customer Reviews with Multi-Source Prior Knowledge in E-commerce,"Chen, B.; Liu, J.; Maimaiti, M.; Gao, X.; Zhang, J.","Customer reviews usually contain much information about one's online shopping experience. While positive reviews are beneficial to the stores, negative ones will largely influence consumers' decision and may lead to a decline in sales. Therefore, it is of vital importance to carefully and persuasively reply to each negative review and minimize its disadvantageous effect. Recent studies consider leveraging generation models to help the sellers respond. However, this problem is not well-addressed as the reviews may contain multiple aspects of issues which should be resolved accordingly and persuasively. In this work, we propose a Multi-Source Multi-Aspect Attentive Generation model for persuasive response generation. Various sources of information are appropriately obtained and leveraged by the proposed model for generating more informative and persuasive responses. A multi-aspect attentive network is proposed to automatically attend to different aspects in a review and ensure most of the issues are tackled. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and online tests prove that our deployed system significantly enhances the efficiency of the stores' dealing with negative reviews.",2022,,,,,,,,330,#7764,Chen 2022,,,0

SEQUENTIAL INFORMATION DESIGN: LEARNING TO PERSUADE IN THE DARK,"Bernasconi, M.; Castiglioni, M.; Marchesi, A.; Gatti, N.; Trovò, F.","We study a repeated information design problem faced by an informed sender who tries to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver. We consider settings where the receiver faces a sequential decision making (SDM) problem. At each round, the sender observes the realizations of random events in the SDM problem. This begets the challenge of how to incrementally disclose such information to the receiver to persuade them to follow (desirable) action recommendations. We study the case in which the sender does not know random events probabilities, and, thus, they have to gradually learn them while persuading the receiver. We start by providing a non-trivial polytopal approximation of the set of sender's persuasive information structures. This is crucial to design efficient learning algorithms. Next, we prove a negative result: no learning algorithm can be persuasive. Thus, we relax persuasiveness requirements by focusing on algorithms that guarantee that the receiver's regret in following recommendations grows sub-linearly. In the full-feedback setting-where the sender observes all random events realizations-, we provide an algorithm with Õ(√T) regret for both the sender and the receiver. Instead, in the bandit-feedback setting-where the sender only observes the realizations of random events actually occurring in the SDM problem-, we design an algorithm that, given an α ∈ [1/2, 1] as input, ensures Õ(Tα) and Õ(Tmax{α;1-α/2}) regrets, for the sender and the receiver respectively. This result is complemented by a lower bound showing that such a regrets trade-off is essentially tight.",2022,,,,,,,,332,#7766,Bernasconi 2022,,,0
ON THE HORIZON: INTERACTIVE AND COMPOSITIONAL DEEPFAKES,"Horvitz, E.","Over a five-year period, computing methods for generating high-fidelity, fictional depictions of people and events moved from exotic demonstrations by computer science research teams into ongoing use as a tool of disinformation. The methods, referred to with the portmanteau of “deepfakes,"" have been used to create compelling audiovisual content. Here, I share challenges ahead with malevolent uses of two classes of deepfakes that we can expect to come into practice with costly implications for society: interactive and compositional deepfakes. Interactive deepfakes have the capability to impersonate people with realistic interactive behaviors, taking advantage of advances in multimodal interaction. Compositional deepfakes leverage synthetic content in larger disinformation plans that integrate sets of deepfakes over time with observed, expected, and engineered world events to create persuasive synthetic histories. Synthetic histories can be constructed manually but may one day be guided by adversarial generative explanation (AGE) techniques. In the absence of mitigations, interactive and compositional deepfakes threaten to move us closer to a post-epistemic world, where fact cannot be distinguished from fiction. I shall describe interactive and compositional deepfakes and reflect about cautions and potential mitigations to defend against them.",2022,,,,,,,,333,#7767,Horvitz 2022,,,0

Rationality-Robust Information Design: Bayesian Persuasion under Quantal Response,"Feng, Y.; Ho, C.-J.; Tang, W.","Classic mechanism/information design imposes the assumption that agents are fully rational, meaning each of them always selects the action that maximizes her expected utility. Yet many empirical evidence suggests that human decisions may deviate from this full rationality assumption. In this work, we attempt to relax the full rationality assumption with bounded rationality. Specifically, we formulate the bounded rationality of an agent by adopting the quantal response model (McKelvey and Palfrey, 1995). We develop a theory of rationality-robust information design in the canonical setting of Bayesian persuasion (Kamenica and Gentzkow, 2011) with binary receiver action. We first identify conditions under which the optimal signaling scheme structure for a fully rational receiver remains optimal or approximately optimal for a boundedly rational receiver. In practice, it might be costly for the designer to estimate the degree of the receiver’s bounded rationality level. Motivated by this practical consideration, we then study the existence and construction of robust signaling schemes when there is uncertainty about the receiver’s bounded rationality level.",2022,,,,,,,,335,#7769,Feng 2022,,,0
Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Chatbots in Promoting Health Behavioral Changes: A Systematic Review,"Aggarwal, A.; Tam, C.C.; Wu, D.; Li, X.; Qiao, S.","Background Artificial-Intelligence (AI)-based chatbots can offer personalized, engaging, and on-demand health-promotion interventions. This systematic review evaluates the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI-chatbots in promoting health-behavior change. Methods A comprehensive search was conducted in seven bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsychoINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated feasibility and/or efficacy of AI-chatbots for behavioral change. The screening, extraction, and analyses of identified articles followed the PRISMA guidelines. Results Of the 15 included studies, majority studies (n=11) reported high usability, acceptability and engagement, and some evidence on feasibility of AI-chatbots. Selected studies demonstrated high efficacy in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6), smoking cessation (n=4), treatment/medication adherence (n=2), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1). Behavioral change theories and/or expert consultation were used to develop behavioral change strategies of AI-chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement/feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI-chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (e.g., smartphones and messenger). Participants also reported that AI-chatbots offered a non-judgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI-techniques, and limitation for generalizability. Conclusion AI-chatbots have demonstrated efficacy of health-behavior change interventions among large and diverse population; however, future studies need to adopt robust RCTs to establish definitive conclusions.",2022,,,,,,,,336,#7770,Aggarwal 2022,,,0
Eco-driving for Electric Connected Vehicles at Signalized Intersections: A Parameterized Reinforcement Learning approach,"Jiang, X.; Zhang, J.; Li, D.","This paper proposes an eco-driving framework for electric connected vehicles (CVs) based on reinforcement learning (RL) to improve vehicle energy efficiency at signalized intersections. The vehicle agent is specified by integrating the model-based car-following policy, lane-changing policy, and the RL policy, to ensure safe operation of a CV. Subsequently, a Markov Decision Process (MDP) is formulated, which enables the vehicle to perform longitudinal control and lateral decisions, jointly optimizing the car-following and lane-changing behaviors of the CVs in the vicinity of intersections. Then, the hybrid action space is parameterized as a hierarchical structure and thereby trains the agents with two-dimensional motion patterns in a dynamic traffic environment. Finally, our proposed methods are evaluated in SUMO software from both a single-vehicle-based perspective and a flow-based perspective. The results show that our strategy can significantly reduce energy consumption by learning proper action schemes without any interruption of other human-driven vehicles (HDVs).",2022,,,,,,,,337,#7771,Jiang 2022,,,0
Optimizing Fault Detection for Big Data Analytics Through Evolutionary Computation,"Jothi, P.; Dwivedi, M.","Intelligent fault detection is promising to deal with big data due to its ability in rapidly and efficiently processing collected signals and providing accurate detection results. In traditional fault detection methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise, such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning artificial intelligence techniques are used to learn features from the raw data. As the dimensionality increases, the accuracy of fault identification methods implemented on big data decreases significantly. For supervised learning, large volume of data is needed which leads to high cost and time consuming. In this paper, an unsupervised learning approach is proposed based on weighted softmax regression for fault detection using the power signals. Fault prediction has become an important subject in recent years, as it helps businesses to make significant savings in time and expense by offering successful methods for predictive maintenance. Pre-processing of data was a complicated job to overcome many problems with the dataset, including scale, sparsity, distortion, burst effects and confidence. As pre-monitor signals for failure did not share standard patterns, but were characterized only as non-normal system signals, a predictive error was made using outlier detection. Faults were explained by displaying system characteristics with abnormal values. An experimental assessment was conducted to determine the quality of the solution proposed. Results indicate that high-grade outliers provide successful markers of initial failures. In addition, explanations about irregular characteristic values (responsible for oversight) seem rather expressive. Based on the sliding window technique, the method to detect errors in high dimensional data streams is applied to an on-line mode. The online extension can be adapted to the time changing behaviour of the controlled system by experiments on synthetic datasets and is therefore applicable to the dynamic error detection. To assess the suggested strategy, we contrasted it with engineered data sets created utilizing the LOF (online expansion), SVDD, and KPCA approaches getting more than 90% result. The data exhibit our methodology's accomplishment as far as perfection, productivity, and strength.",2022,,,,,,,,338,#7772,Jothi 2022,,,0
A Formal Understanding of Computational Empathy in Interactive Agents,"Brännström, A.; Wester, J.; Nieves, J.C.","Rational software agents, embodied as conversational agents, such as chatbots, are progressively being used in the area of health and well-being. In such applications, where rational agents aim to engage users in interpersonal conversations for, e.g., coaching, comfort or behavior-change interventions, there is an increased need for understanding systems' empathic capabilities. In the current state-of-the-art, there are no tools to do that. In order to understand empathic capabilities in rational software systems, we need a precise notion of empathy. The literature discusses a variety of definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus of a formal definition. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in conversational agents for health and well-being, a formal definition (in terms of an ontology) of empathy is developed. We evaluate this formal definition in a controlled user-study by applying it as a tool for assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots; Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition of empathy identifies different necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents.",2022,,,,,,,,340,#7774,Brännström 2022,,,0
Generation and Classification of Motivational-Interviewing-Style Reflections for Smoking Behaviour Change Using Few-Shot Learning with Transformers,"Rose, J.; Ahmed, I.; Keilty, E.; Cooper, C.; Selby, P.","If conversational agents can take on a therapeutic role, they may provide a scalable way to help many people suffering from addictions. Motivational Interviewing (MI) is a validated therapy for behaviour change that can be applied to addiction, including smoking cessation. A core technique in MI (and many other kinds of talk therapy) is to pose an open-ended question concerning a negative behaviour, and then to provide a reflection of the response. Reflections can be a simple restatement of the response, or a more complex inference from prior statements or general knowledge, and they help a person contemplate the behaviour more deeply. We describe a method to generate reflections that uses few-shot priming of the GPT-2 and GPT-3 language models. These produce very promising simple and complex reflections, but also some that are off-topic or irrelevant. To filter these, we train a classifier to detect poor reflections, employing samples labeled by an MI expert. Its accuracy is 81%, sensitivity 90% and specificity 71%. We show that GPT-2 can generate acceptable reflections at a 54% success rate, and when combined with the classifier/filter produces acceptable reflections 73% of the time. The GPT-3 model has a native success rate of 89%.",2022,,,,,,,,341,#7775,Rose 2022,,,0
Integrating fuzzy trajectory data and artificial intelligence methods for multi-style lane-changing behavior prediction,"Gu, R.","Artificial intelligence algorithms have been extensively applied in the field of intelligent transportation, especially for driving behavior analysis and prediction. This study proposes a novel framework by integrating fuzzy trajectory data, unsupervised learning and supervised learning methods to predict lane-changing behaviors taking multi driving styles into account. The microscopic trajectory data from the Highway Drone Dataset (HighD) are employed to construct two types of datasets including precise trajectory datasets and fuzzy trajectory datasets for lane-changing prediction models. The fuzzy trajectory data are developed based on different driving styles, which are clustered by the K-means algorithm. Two typical supervised learning methods, including random forest and long-short-term memory combined with convolutional neural network, are further applied for lane-changing behavior prediction. Results indicate that (1) the proposed integration approach performs better than the conventional lane-change prediction; (2) the relative speed-related features have a greater contribution to the lane-changing prediction after being processed by fuzzy rules based on driving styles; and (3) the difference among driving styles is more reflected from the state of lateral movement rather than the lane-changing duration.",2022,,,,,,,,342,#7776,Gu 2022,,,0

Model’s performance related metrics: the gain and lift chart, predictive-pseudo probability chart, and receiver operative curve (ROC) curve were noted as persuasive. Considering the sensitivity and specificity, area under the curve (AUC) values were also noted quite convincing; 0.954 for Non-dysplasia group while 0.994 for acute myeloid leukemia with dysplasia (AML-Dys) followed by 0.992, 0.988, 0.986, 0.984, 0.973, and 0.962 for chronic myelo-monocytic leukemia (CMML), refractory anemia with excess blast-I (RAEB-I), refractory anemia with excess blast-II (RAEB-II), refractory anemia with multi-lineage dysplasia (RCMD), Hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome (H-MDS), and refractory anemia with uni-lineage dysplasia (RCUD) respectively.

ZETAR: Modeling and Computational Design of Strategic and Adaptive Compliance Policies,"Huang, L.; Zhu, Q.","Compliance management plays an important role in mitigating insider threats. Incentive design is a proactive and non-invasive approach to achieving compliance by aligning an insider’s incentive with the defender’s security objective, which motivates (rather than commands) an insider to act in the organization’s interests. Controlling insiders’ incentives for population-level compliance is challenging because they are neither precisely known nor directly controllable. To this end, we develop ZETAR, a zero-trust audit and recommendation framework, to provide a quantitative approach to model insiders’ incentives and design customized recommendation policies to improve their compliance. We formulate primal and dual convex programs to compute the optimal bespoke recommendation policies. We create the theoretical underpinning for understanding trust, compliance, and satisfaction, which leads to scoring mechanisms of how compliant and persuadable an insider is. After classifying insiders as malicious, self-interested, or amenable based on their incentive misalignment levels with the defender, we establish bespoke information disclosure principles for these insiders of different incentive categories. We identify the policy separability principle and the set convexity, which enable finite-step algorithms to efficiently learn the Completely Trustworthy (CT) policy set when insiders’ incentives are unknown. Finally, we present a case study to corroborate the design. Our results show that ZETAR can well adapt to insiders with different risk and compliance attitudes and significantly improve compliance. Moreover, trustworthy recommendations can provably promote cyber hygiene and insiders’ satisfaction.",2022,,,,,,,,345,#7779,Huang 2022,,,0
An Audit of Misinformation Filter Bubbles on YouTube: Bubble Bursting and Recent Behavior Changes,"Tomlein, M.; Pecher, B.; Simko, J.; Podrouzek, J.; Bielikova, M.","The negative effects of misinformation filter bubbles in adaptive systems have been known to researchers for some time. Several studies investigated, most prominently on YouTube, how fast a user can get into a misinformation filter bubble simply by selecting “wrong choices” from the items offered. Yet, no studies so far have investigated what it takes to “burst the bubble”, i.e., revert the bubble enclosure. We present a study in which pre-programmed agents (acting as YouTube users) delve into misinformation filter bubbles by watching misinformation promoting content (for various topics). Then, by watching misinformation debunking content, the agents try to burst the bubbles and reach more balanced recommendation mixes. We recorded the search results and recommendations, which the agents encountered, and analyzed them for the presence of misinformation. Our key finding is that bursting of a filter bubble is possible, albeit it manifests differently from topic to topic. Moreover, we observe that filter bubbles do not truly appear in some situations. We also draw a direct comparison with a previous study. Sadly, we did not find much improvements in misinformation occurrences, despite recent pledges by YouTube.",2022,,,,,,,,347,#7781,Tomlein 2022,,,0
Recognising the importance of preference change: A call for a coordinated multidisciplinary research effort in the age of AI,"Franklin, M.; Ashton, H.; Gorman, R.; Armstrong, S.","As artificial intelligence becomes more powerful and a ubiquitous presence in daily life, it is imperative to understand and manage the impact of AI systems on our lives and decisions. Modern ML systems often change user behavior (e.g. personalized recommender systems learn user preferences to deliver recommendations that change online behavior). An externality of behavior change is preference change. This article argues for the establishment of a multidisciplinary endeavor focused on understanding how AI systems change preference: Preference Science. We operationalize preference to incorporate concepts from various disciplines, outlining the importance of meta-preferences and preference-change preferences, and proposing a preliminary framework for how preferences change. We draw a distinction between preference change, permissible preference change, and outright preference manipulation. A diversity of disciplines contribute unique insights to this framework.",2022,,,,,,,,348,#7782,Franklin 2022,,,0
Influencing Long-Term Behavior in Multiagent Reinforcement Learning,"Kim, D.-K.; Riemer, M.; Liu, M.; Tesauro, G.; How, J.P.","The main challenge of multiagent reinforcement learning is the difficulty of learning useful policies in the presence of other simultaneously learning agents whose changing behaviors jointly affect the environment's transition and reward dynamics. An effective approach that has recently emerged for addressing this non-stationarity is for each agent to anticipate the learning of other agents and influence the evolution of future policies towards desirable behavior for its own benefit. Unfortunately, previous approaches for achieving this suffer from myopic evaluation, considering only a finite number of policy updates. As such, these methods can only influence transient future policies rather than achieving the promise of scalable equilibrium selection approaches that influence the behavior at convergence. In this paper, we propose a principled framework for considering the limiting policies of other agents as time approaches infinity. Specifically, we develop a new optimization objective that maximizes each agent's average reward by directly accounting for the impact of its behavior on the limiting set of policies that other agents will converge to. Our paper characterizes desirable solution concepts within this problem setting and provides practical approaches for optimizing over possible outcomes. As a result of our farsighted objective, we demonstrate better long-term performance than state-of-the-art baselines across a suite of diverse multiagent benchmark domains.",2022,,,,,,,,351,#7785,Kim 2022,,,0
Metacognitive Agents for Ethical Decision Support: Conceptual Model and Research Roadmap,"Kennedy, C.M.","An ethical value-action gap exists when there is a discrepancy between intentions and actions. For example, people who support environmental sustainability often use cars and short-haul flights because of convenience and time-pressure. This discrepancy may be caused by social and structural obstacles as well as cognitive biases. Current technology can make this worse. For example, social media tends to enhance emotions such as anger or fear, which can result in polarisation and impulsive decisions. Computational models of cognition and affect can provide insights into the value-action gap and how it can be reduced. Such models include dual process architectures, emotion models and behaviour change theories. In particular, metacognition (“thinking about thinking”) plays an important role in many of these models as a mechanism for self-regulation and for reasoning about mental attitudes. This paper outlines a roadmap for translating cognitive-affective models into assistant agents to help make value-aligned decisions. Key principles include “agile” rapid-prototyping using agent-based simulation, and the combination of descriptive and normative models into a single agent architecture.",2022,,,,,,,,352,#7786,Kennedy 2022,,,0
Sequential Information Design: Markov Persuasion Process and Its Efficient Reinforcement Learning,"Wu, J.; Zhang, Z.; Feng, Z.; Jordan, M.I.; Xu, H.","In today's economy, it becomes important for Internet platforms to consider the sequential information design problem to align its long term interest with incentives of the gig service providers (e.g., drivers, hosts). This paper proposes a novel model of sequential information design, namely the Markov persuasion processes (MPPs). Specifically, in an MPP, a sender, with informational advantage, seeks to persuade a stream of myopic receivers to take actions that maximizes the sender's cumulative utilities in a finite horizon Markovian environment with varying prior and utility functions. Planning in MPPs thus faces the unique challenge in finding a signaling policy that is simultaneously persuasive to the myopic receivers and inducing the optimal long-term cumulative utilities of the sender. Nevertheless, in the population level where the model is known, it turns out that we can efficiently determine the optimal (resp. ǫ-optimal) policy with finite (resp. infinite) states and outcomes, through a modified formulation of the Bellman equation that additionally takes persuasiveness into consideration. Our main technical contribution is to study the MPP under the online reinforcement learning (RL) setting, where the goal is to learn the optimal signaling policy by interacting with with the underlying MPP, without the knowledge of the sender's utility functions, prior distributions, and the Markov transition kernels. For such a problem, we design a provably efficient no-regret learning algorithm, the Optimism-Pessimism Principle for Persuasion Process (OP4), which features a novel combination of both optimism and pessimism principles. In particular, we obtain optimistic estimates of the value functions to encourage exploration under the unknown environment. Meanwhile, we additionally robustify the signaling policy with respect to the uncertainty of prior estimation to prevent receiver's detrimental equilibrium behavior. Our algorithm enjoys sample efficiency by achieving a sublinear √T -regret upper bound. Furthermore, both our algorithm and theory can be applied to MPPs with large space of outcomes and states via function approximation, and we showcase such a success under the linear setting.",2022,,,,,,,,353,#7787,Wu 2022,,,0
Automatic Generation of Individual Fuzzy Cognitive Maps from Longitudinal Data,"Wozniak, M.K.; Mkhitaryan, S.; Giabbanelli, P.J.","Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCMs) are computational models that represent how factors (nodes) change over discrete interactions based on causal impacts (weighted directed edges) from other factors. This approach has traditionally been used as an aggregate, similarly to System Dynamics, to depict the functioning of a system. There has been a growing interest in taking this aggregate approach at the individual-level, for example by equipping each agent of an Agent-Based Model with its own FCM to express its behavior. Although frameworks and studies have already taken this approach, an ongoing limitation has been the difficulty of creating as many FCMs as there are individuals. Indeed, current studies have been able to create agents whose traits are different, but whose decision-making modules are often identical, thus limiting the behavioral heterogeneity of the simulated population. In this paper, we address this limitation by using Genetic Algorithms to create one FCM for each agent, thus providing the means to automatically create a virtual population with heterogeneous behaviors. Our algorithm builds on prior work from Stach and colleagues by introducing additional constraints into the process and applying it over longitudinal, individual-level data. A case study from a real-world intervention on nutrition confirms that our approach can generate heterogeneous agents that closely follow the trajectories of their real-world human counterparts. Future works include technical improvements such as lowering the computational time of the approach, or case studies in computational intelligence that use our virtual populations to test new behavior change interventions.",2022,,,,,,,,354,#7788,Wozniak 2022,,,0
A Simplified Variant of Gödel's Ontological Argument,"Benzmüller, C.","A simplified variant of Gödel's ontological argument is presented. The simplified argument is valid already in basic modal logics K or KT, it does not suffer from modal collapse, and it avoids the rather complex predicates of essence (Ess.) and necessary existence (NE) as used by Gödel. The variant presented has been obtained as a side result of a series of theory simplification experiments conducted in interaction with a modern proof assistant system. The starting point for these experiments was the computer encoding of Gödel's argument, and then automated reasoning techniques were systematically applied to arrive at the simplified variant presented. The presented work thus exemplifies a fruitful human-computer interaction in computational metaphysics. Whether the presented result increases or decreases the attractiveness and persuasiveness of the ontological argument is a question I would like to pass on to philosophy and theology.",2022,,,,,,,,355,#7789,Benzmüller 2022,,,0
Measuring why in recommender systems: A comprehensive survey on the evaluation of explainable recommendation,"Chen, X.; Zhang, Y.; Wen, J.-R.","Explainable recommendation has shown its great advantages for improving recommendation persuasiveness, user satisfaction, system transparency and among others.

Beyond summarization, we also analyze the (dis)advantages of existing evaluation methods, and provide a series of guidelines on how to select them.

Diagnosis of Phobic Anxiety Disorders using Virtual Reality Environment,"Munir, A.; Saleem, Y.","Specific Phobia Anxiety disorders are rarely detected in a clinical setting and are indicators of other grave mental health problems. VR is a persuasive tool for diagnosing and treating psychiatric problems, but the Virtual Reality applications developed are reported to lack a methodological approach. This particular research consults the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5) by the American Psychiatric Association (APA)to strengthen objectivity and add reliability to the assessment. We investigated participants’ behavior in the Virtual Reality Environment. The participant walks or runs along a road in four different scenarios of a Virtual Reality Environment. The first scenario is a neutral environment with no phobic stimulus; the afterward situations pose for a dog cue, thunder lightning stimulus, and a combination of both stimulation consecutively. The assessment measures include distance and time calculated in each VRE scene, minimum and maximum oxygen levels and heart rate recorded for each scenario, physical and verbal reactions observed, self-reported measure of Cybersickness, and Sense of Presence. Participant’s information such as name, age, gender, any bad experience with dogs or thunder lightning, and proposed phobia severity levels of parents. The “APA Specific Phobia Severity Measure - Adult” by DSM-5 classifies every record. Applying Artificial Intelligence learning models suggests Astraphobic patients also suffer from Dog phobia. The results imply that the Sense of Presence is a decisive factor in the assessment. It signifies that distance, time interval, and change in oxygen levels in the presence of phobic cues are influential parameters for phobia estimation.",2022,,,,,,,,357,#7791,Munir 2022,,,0
Graph Convolution-Based Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Agent Decision-Making in Mixed Traffic Environments,"Liu, Q.; Li, Z.; Li, X.; Wu, J.; Yuan, S.","An efficient and reliable multi-agent decision-making system is highly demanded for the safe and efficient operation of connected autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems. Current researches mainly focus on the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. However, utilizing DRL methods in interactive traffic scenarios is hard to represent the mutual effects between different vehicles and model the dynamic traffic environments due to the lack of interactive information in the representation of the environments, which results in low accuracy of cooperative decisions generation. To tackle these difficulties, this research proposes a framework to enable different Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL) methods for decision-making, and compares their performance in interactive driving scenarios. GRL methods combinate the Graph Neural Network (GNN) and DRL to achieve the better decisions generation in interactive scenarios of autonomous vehicles, where the features of interactive scenarios are extracted by the GNN, and cooperative behaviors are generated by DRL framework. Several GRL approaches are summarized and implemented in the proposed framework. To evaluate the performance of the proposed GRL methods, an interactive driving scenarios on highway with two ramps is constructed, and simulated experiment in the SUMO platform is carried out to evaluate the performance of different GRL approaches. Finally, results are analyzed in multiple perspectives and dimensions to compare the characteristic of different GRL approaches in intelligent transportation scenarios. Results show that the implementation of GNN can well represents the interaction between vehicles, and the combination of GNN and DRL is able to improve the performance of the generation of lane-change behaviors.

Bayesian Promised Persuasion: Dynamic Forward-Looking Multiagent Delegation with Informational Burning,"Zhang, T.; Zhu, Q.","This work studies a dynamic mechanism design problem in which a principal delegates decision makings to a group of privately-informed agents without the monetary transfer or burning. We consider that the principal privately possesses complete knowledge about the state transitions and study how she can use her private observation to support the incentive compatibility of the delegation via informational burning, a process we refer to as the looking-forward persuasion. The delegation mechanism is formulated in which the agents form belief hierarchies due to the persuasion and play a dynamic Bayesian game. We propose a novel randomized mechanism, known as Bayesian promised delegation (BPD), in which the periodic incentive compatibility is guaranteed by persuasions and promises of future delegations. We show that the BPD can achieve the same optimal social welfare as the original mechanism in stationary Markov perfect Bayesian equilibria. A revelation-principle-like design regime is established to show that the persuasion with belief hierarchies can be fully characterized by correlating the randomization of the agents' local BPD mechanisms with the persuasion as a direct recommendation of the future promises.",2022,,,,,,,,360,#7794,Zhang 2022,,,0

The agent is anticipated to perform appropriate lane-change maneuvers in a real-world-like udacity simulator after training it for a total of 100 episodes.

Watch Those Words: Video Falsification Detection Using Word-Conditioned Facial Motion,"Agarwal, S.; Hu, L.; Ng, E.; Li, H.; Rohrbach, A.","In today's era of digital misinformation, we are increasingly faced with new threats posed by video falsification techniques. Such falsifications range from cheapfakes (e.g., lookalikes or audio dubbing) to deepfakes (e.g., sophisticated AI media synthesis methods), which are becoming perceptually indistinguishable from real videos. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-modal semantic forensic approach to discover clues that go beyond detecting discrepancies in visual quality, thereby handling both simpler cheapfakes and visually persuasive deepfakes. In this work, our goal is to verify that the purported person seen in the video is indeed themselves by detecting anomalous facial movements corresponding to the spoken words. We leverage the idea of attribution to learn person-specific biometric patterns that distinguish a given speaker from others. We use interpretable Action Units (AUs) to capture a person's face and head movement as opposed to deep CNN features, and we are the first to use word-conditioned facial motion analysis. We further demonstrate our method's effectiveness on a range of fakes not seen in training including those without video manipulation, that were not addressed in prior work.",2021,,,,,,,,362,#7796,Agarwal 2021,,,0
Machine learning for utility prediction in argument-based computational persuasion,"Donadello, I.; Hunter, A.; Teso, S.; Dragoni, M.","Automated persuasion systems (APS) aim to persuade a user to believe something by entering into a dialogue in which arguments and counterarguments are exchanged. To maximize the probability that an APS is successful in persuading a user, it can identify a global policy that will allow it to select the best arguments it presents at each stage of the dialogue whatever arguments the user presents. However, in real applications, such as for healthcare, it is unlikely the utility of the outcome of the dialogue will be the same, or the exact opposite, for the APS and user. In order to deal with this situation, games in extended form have been harnessed for argumentation in Bi-party Decision Theory. This opens new problems that we address in this paper: (1) How can we use Machine Learning (ML) methods to predict utility functions for different subpopulations of users? and (2) How can we identify for a new user the best utility function from amongst those that we have learned? To this extent, we develop two ML methods, EAI and EDS, that leverage information coming from the users to predict their utilities. EAI is restricted to a fixed amount of information, whereas EDS can choose the information that best detects the subpopulations of a user. We evaluate EAI and EDS in a simulation setting and in a realistic case study concerning healthy eating habits. Results are promising in both cases, but EDS is more effective at predicting useful utility functions.",2021,,,,,,,,364,#7798,Donadello 2021,,,0

This work proposes a computational approach to analyze the outcome of persuasive information in multi-modal content, focusing on two aspects, popularity and reliability, in COVID-19-related news articles shared on Twitter. The two aspects are intertwined in the spread of misinformation: for example, an unreliable article that aims to misinform has to attain some popularity. This work has several contributions. First, we propose a multi-modal (image and text) approach to effectively identify popularity and reliability of information sources simultaneously. Second, we identify textual and visual elements that are predictive to information popularity and reliability. Third, by modeling cross-modal relations and similarity, we are able to uncover how unreliable articles construct multi-modal meaning in a distorted, biased fashion.

Outlier detection using AI: A survey,"Sikder, M.N.K.; Batarseh, F.A.","An outlier is an event or observation that is defined as an unusual activity, intrusion, or a suspicious data point that lies at an irregular distance from a population. The definition of an outlier event, however, is subjective and depends on the application and the domain (Energy, Health, Wireless Network, etc.). It is important to detect outlier events as carefully as possible to avoid infrastructure failures because anomalous events can cause minor to severe damage to infrastructure. For instance, an attack on a cyber-physical system such as a microgrid may initiate voltage or frequency instability, thereby damaging a smart inverter which involves very expensive repairing. Unusual activities in microgrids can be mechanical faults, behavior changes in the system, human or instrument errors or a malicious attack. Accordingly, and due to its variability, Outlier Detection (OD) is an ever-growing research field. In this chapter, we discuss the progress of OD methods using AI techniques. For that, the fundamental concepts of each OD model are introduced via multiple categories. Broad range of OD methods are categorized into six major categories: Statistical-based, Distance-based, Density-based, Clustering-based, Learning-based, and Ensemble methods. For every category, we discuss recent state-of-the-art approaches, their application areas, and performances.

Cloud Failure Prediction with Hierarchical Temporal Memory: An Empirical Assessment,"Riganelli, O.; Saltarel, P.; Tundo, A.; Mobilio, M.; Mariani, L.","Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is an unsupervised learning algorithm inspired by the features of the neocortex that can be used to continuously process stream data and detect anomalies, without requiring a large amount of data for training nor requiring labeled data.HTM is also able to continuously learn from samples, providing a model that is always up-to-date with respect to observations. These characteristics make HTM particularly suitable for supporting online failure prediction in cloud systems, which are systems with a dynamically changing behavior that must be monitored to anticipate problems. This paper presents the first systematic study that assesses HTM in the context of failure prediction.

Influencing towards stable multi-agent interactions,"Wang, W.Z.; Shih, A.; Xie, A.; Sadigh, D.","Learning in multi-agent environments is difficult due to the non-stationarity introduced by an opponent’s or partner’s changing behaviors. Instead of reactively adapting to the other agent’s (opponent or partner) behavior, we propose an algorithm to proactively influence the other agent’s strategy to stabilize –which can restrain the non-stationarity caused by the other agent. We learn a low-dimensional latent representation of the other agent’s strategy and the dynamics of how the latent strategy evolves with respect to our robot’s behavior. With this learned dynamics model, we can define an unsupervised stability reward to train our robot to deliberately influence the other agent to stabilize towards a single strategy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of stabilizing in improving efficiency of maximizing the task reward in a variety of simulated environments, including autonomous driving, emergent communication, and robotic manipulation.

MEPG: A Minimalist Ensemble Policy Gradient Framework for Deep Reinforcement Learning,"He, Q.; Su, H.; Gong, C.; Hou, X.","During the training of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent, the distribution of training data is non-stationary as the agent's behavior changes over time. Therefore, there is a risk that the agent is overspecialized to a particular distribution and its performance suffers in the larger picture. Ensemble RL can mitigate this issue by learning a robust policy. However, it suffers from heavy computational resource consumption due to the newly introduced value and policy functions. In this paper, to avoid the notorious resources consumption issue, we design a novel and simple ensemble deep RL framework that integrates multiple models into a single model. Specifically, we propose the Minimalist Ensemble Policy Gradient framework (MEPG), which introduces minimalist ensemble consistent Bellman update by utilizing a modified dropout operator. MEPG holds ensemble property by keeping the dropout consistency of both sides of the Bellman equation. Additionally, the dropout operator also increases MEPG's generalization capability. Moreover, we theoretically show that the policy evaluation phase in the MEPG maintains two synchronized deep Gaussian Processes. To verify the MEPG framework's ability to generalize, we perform experiments on the gym simulator, which presents that the MEPG framework outperforms or achieves a similar level of performance as the current state-of-the-art ensemble methods and model-free methods without increasing additional computational resource costs.",2021,,,,,,,,370,#7804,He 2021,,,0
Strategic mitigation of agent inattention in drivers with open-quantum cognition models,"Zhang, Q.; Siddhardh Nadendla, V.S.; Balakrishnan, S.N.; Busemeyer, J.","State-of-the-art driver-assist systems have failed to effectively mitigate driver inattention and had minimal impacts on the ever-growing number of road mishaps (e.g. life loss, physical injuries due to accidents caused by various factors that lead to driver inattention). This is because traditional human-machine interaction settings are modeled in classical and behavioral game-theoretic domains which are technically appropriate to characterize strategic interaction between either two utility maximizing agents, or human decision makers. Therefore, in an attempt to improve the persuasive effectiveness of driver-assist systems, we develop a novel strategic and personalized driver-assist system which adapts to the driver’s mental state and choice behavior. First, we propose a novel equilibrium notion in human-system interaction games, where the system maximizes its expected utility and human decisions can be characterized using any general decision model. Then we use this novel equilibrium notion to investigate the strategic driver-vehicle interaction game where the car presents a persuasive recommendation to steer the driver towards safer driving decisions. We assume that the driver employs an open-quantum system cognition model, which captures complex aspects of human decision making such as violations to classical law of total probability and incompatibility of certain mental representations of information. We present closed-form expressions for players’ final responses to each other’s strategies so that we can numerically compute both pure and mixed equilibria.

Multi-receiver online Bayesian persuasion,"Castiglioni, M.; Marchesi, A.; Celli, A.; Gatti, N.","Bayesian persuasion studies how an informed sender should partially disclose information to influence the behavior of a self-interested receiver. Classical models make the stringent assumption that the sender knows the receiver’s utility. This can be relaxed by considering an online learning framework in which the sender repeatedly faces a receiver of an unknown, adversarially selected type. We study, for the first time, an online Bayesian persuasion setting with multiple receivers. We focus on the case with no externalities and binary actions, as customary in offline models. Our goal is to design no-regret algorithms for the sender with polynomial per-iteration running time. First, we prove a negative result: for any 0 < α ≤ 1, there is no polynomial-time no-α-regret algorithm when the sender’s utility function is supermodular or anonymous. Then, we focus on the case of submodular sender’s utility functions and we show that, in this case, it is possible to design a polynomial-time no-(1-1/e)-regret algorithm. To do so, we introduce a general online gradient descent scheme to handle online learning problems with a finite number of possible loss functions. This requires the existence of an approximate projection oracle. We show that, in our setting, there exists one such projection oracle which can be implemented in polynomial time.",2021,,,,,,,,376,#7810,Castiglioni 2021,,,0

We are developing this model to create a more intimate relationship between the system and humans. For this purpose, many open-source platforms are available. Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) is derived from Extensible Markup Language (XML) which is used to build up a conversational agent artificially. The success of this project will help the model in observing and understanding human emotions which will ultimately help it to form a more personalized relationship to delineate the future course of events.",2021,,,,,,,,377,#7811,Sharma 2021,,,0
PAL: Intelligence augmentation using egocentric visual context detection,"Khan, M.; Maes, P.","Egocentric visual context detection can support intelligence augmentation applications. We created a wearable system, called PAL, for wearable, personalized, and privacy-preserving egocentric visual context detection. PAL has a wearable device with a camera, heart-rate sensor, on-device deep learning, and audio input/output. PAL also has a mobile/web application for personalized context labeling. We used on-device deep learning models for generic object and face detection, low-shot custom face and context recognition (e.g., activities like brushing teeth), and custom context clustering (e.g., indoor locations). The models had over 80% accuracy in in-the-wild contexts (∼1000 images) and we tested PAL for intelligence augmentation applications like behavior change. We have made PAL is open-source to further support intelligence augmentation using personalized and privacy-preserving egocentric visual contexts.",2021,,,,,,,,379,#7813,Khan 2021,,,0
Using Geospatial Intelligence to Promote Precautionary Behavior During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Development and Validation of a Customized Messaging Campaign in Saudi Arabia,"Alrige, M.; Bitar, H.; Meccawy, M.; Mullachery, B.","Background Designing a health promotion campaign is never an easy task, especially during a pandemic of a highly infectious disease such as COVID-19. In Saudi Arabia, many attempts have been made to raise public awareness about COVID-19 infection and precautionary health measures. However, most of the health information delivered through the national dashboard and the COVID-19 awareness campaigns are generic and do not necessarily make the impact needed to be seen on individuals’ behavior. Objective The objective of this study is to build and validate a customized messaging campaign to promote precautionary health behavior in individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic. Customization is realized by utilizing a geospatial artificial intelligence technique called the space-time cube (STC) technique. Methods This research was conducted in two sequential phases. In phase 1, an initial library of 32 messages was developed and validated based on Fogg behavior model for behavior change. In phase 2, we applied STC as a geospatial artificial intelligence technique to create a local map for one city with three different profiles representing the city districts. The model was built using COVID-19 real clinical data. The messages created in phase 1 is to be customized for residents in each city profile separately. Results n phase 1, 32 messages were developed based on resources from the World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia. The enumerated content validity of the messages was established through the utilization of the content validity index (CVI). Thirteen professional health care workers (n=13) evaluated the content of the message libraries in Arabic and English. Thirty-two messages were found to have acceptable content validity (I-CVI=0.87). In phase 2, the geospatial intelligence technique we applied showed three zones for the districts of Jeddah city: one for high infection, another for moderate infection, and the third for low infection. Combining the results from the first and second phases, a customized awareness campaign was shaped for the city of Jeddah. Conclusions This awareness campaign can be utilized by health authorities to raise individuals' awareness about the precautionary measures that should be taken based on the infection level of their district, and hence help in reducing the number of positive cases in the city of Jeddah.",2021,,,,,,,,380,#7814,Alrige 2021,,,0
What makes a message persuasive? Identifying adaptations towards persuasiveness in nine exploratory case studies,"Duerr, S.; Lange, K.T.; Gloor, P.A.","The ability to persuade others is critical to professional and personal success. However, crafting persuasive messages is demanding and poses various challenges. We conducted nine exploratory case studies to identify adaptations that professional and non-professional writers make in written scenarios to increase their subjective persuasiveness. Furthermore, we identified challenges that those writers faced and identified strategies to resolve them with persuasive natural language generation, i.e., artificial intelligence. Our findings show that humans can achieve high degrees of persuasiveness (more so for professional-level writers), and artificial intelligence can complement them to achieve increased celerity and alignment in the process.",2021,,,,,,,,381,#7815,Duerr 2021,,,0
An interactive dashboard for searching and comparing soccer performance scores,"Cintia, P.; Pappalardo, L.; Mauro, G.; Ferragina, P.","The performance of soccer players is one of most discussed aspects by many actors in the soccer industry: from supporters to journalists, from coaches to talent scouts. Unfortunately, the dashboards available online provide no effective way to compare the evolution of the performance of players or to find players behaving similarly on the field.

CaSiNo: A corpus of campsite negotiation dialogues for automatic negotiation systems,"Chawla, K.; Ramirez, J.; Clever, R.; May, J.; Gratch, J.","Automated systems that negotiate with humans have broad applications in pedagogy and conversational AI. To advance the development of practical negotiation systems, we present CaSiNo: a novel corpus of over a thousand negotiation dialogues in English. Participants take the role of campsite neighbors and negotiate for food, water, and firewood packages for their upcoming trip. Our design results in diverse and linguistically rich negotiations while maintaining a tractable, closeddomain environment. Inspired by the literature in human-human negotiations, we annotate persuasion strategies and perform correlation analysis to understand how the dialogue behaviors are associated with the negotiation performance. We further propose and evaluate a multi-task framework to recognize these strategies in a given utterance.

Spirit distillation: Precise real-time semantic segmentation of road scenes with insufficient data,"Wu, Z.; Jiang, Y.; Cui, C.; Xue, X.; Qi, H.","Semantic segmentation of road scenes is one of the key technologies for realizing autonomous driving scene perception, and the effectiveness of deep Convolutional Neural Networks(CNNs) for this task has been demonstrated. Stateof-art CNNs for semantic segmentation suffer from excessive computations as well as large-scale training data requirement. Inspired by the ideas of Fine-tuning-based Transfer Learning (FTT) and feature-based knowledge distillation, we propose a new knowledge distillation method for cross-domain knowledge transference and efficient data-insufficient network training, named Spirit Distillation(SD), which allow the student network to mimic the teacher network to extract general features, so that a compact and accurate student network can be trained for real-time semantic segmentation of road scenes. Then, in order to further alleviate the trouble of insufficient data and improve the robustness of the student, an Enhanced Spirit Distillation (ESD) method is proposed, which commits to exploit a more comprehensive general features extraction capability by considering images from both the target and the proximity domains as input. To our knowledge, this paper is a pioneering work on the application of knowledge distillation to few-shot learning. Persuasive experiments conducted on Cityscapes semantic segmentation with the prior knowledge transferred from COCO2017 and KITTI demonstrate that our methods can train a better student network (mIOU and high-precision accuracy boost by 1.4% and 8.2% respectively, with 78.2% segmentation variance) with only 41.8% FLOPs (see Fig. 1).",2021,,,,,,,,385,#7819,Wu 2021,,,0

RESPER: Computationally modelling resisting strategies in persuasive conversations.,"Dutt, R.; Sinha, S.; Joshi, R.; Bao, H.; Rosé, C.P.","Modelling persuasion strategies as predictors of task outcome has several real-world applications and has received considerable attention from the computational linguistics community. However, previous research has failed to account for the resisting strategies employed by an individual to foil such persuasion attempts. Grounded in prior literature in cognitive and social psychology, we propose a generalised framework for identifying resisting strategies in persuasive conversations. We instantiate our framework on two distinct datasets comprising persuasion and negotiation conversations. We also leverage a hierarchical sequence-labelling neural architecture to infer the aforementioned resisting strategies automatically. Our experiments reveal the asymmetry of power roles in non-collaborative goal-directed conversations and the benefits accrued from incorporating resisting strategies on the final conversation outcome. We also investigate the role of different resisting strategies on the conversation outcome and glean insights that corroborate with past findings. We also make the code and the dataset of this work publicly available at https://github.com/americast/ resper.",2021,,,,,,,,390,#7824,Dutt 2021,,,0
"AI, Ethics, and Law: A Possible Way Forward","Davis, J.P.","This Chapter offers a framework for analyzing the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), ethics, and law. It does so, as Part 1 explains, by (1) suggesting potential limitations on AI consciousness and identifying the implications of those limitations for ethics and law, and (2) acknowledging three possible philosophical objections to this line of analysis and providing reasons to reject each of them. Part 2 explores the role that consciousness plays in forming objectives, including in making relevant moral and other value judgments. It suggests that as long as AI lacks consciousness we will have difficulty regulating it — our ethics and law often rely on intent in assigning, respectively, moral responsibility and legal liability — and difficulty using it to regulate ourselves — value judgments play an important role in resolving ethical and legal disputes. It also notes that conscious AI is likely to have very different first-person experiences than we do — and hence very different forms of intent and values than we have — giving rise to another set of difficulties for regulating it and for it regulating us. With this sketch of an argument in place, Part 3 addresses three potential philosophical objections to it: that consciousness as a matter of theory cannot have the sort of causal effect on behavior that Part 2 presumes; that consciousness as a matter of empirical fact does not have that sort of causal effect; and that Part 2 relies on a dubious understanding of free will. Part 3 contends that none of these objections is persuasive. The Chapter concludes that the analysis in Part 2 warrants further development.",2021,,,,,,,,391,#7825,Davis 2021,,,0
Data Obsolescence Detection in the Light of Newly Acquired Valid Observations,"Chaieb, S.; Hnich, B.; Mrad, A.B.","The information describing the conditions of a system or a person is constantly evolving and may become obsolete and contradict other infor-mation. A database, therefore, must be consistently updated upon the acqui-sition of new valid observations that contradict obsolete ones contained in the database. In this paper, we propose a novel causation-based system for dealing with the information obsolescence problem when a causal Bayesian network is our representation model. Our approach is based on studying causal depen-dencies between the network variables to detect, in real-time, contradictions between the observations on a single subject and then identify the obsolete ones. We propose a new approximate concept, ϵ-Contradiction, which repre-sents the confidence level of having a contradiction between some observations relating to a specific subject. Once identified, obsolete observations are given in an original way, in the form of an explanation AND-OR Tree. Our approach can be applied in various domains where the main issue is to detect and explain personalized situations such that the reasons and circumstances underlying unexpected outcomes. Examples include among others: detecting behaviour change by analyzing user profiles, and identifying the causes of some anoma-lies such as bank frauds by analyzing customer interactions. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a real-life medical appli-cation: the elderly fall-prevention and showcase how the resulted explanation AND-OR trees can be used to give reliable recommendations to physicians and assist decision-makers. Our approach runs in a polynomial time and gives systematically and substantially good results.",2021,,,,,,,,392,#7826,Chaieb 2021,,,0
Persuasive natural language generation - A literature review,"Duerr, S.; Gloor, P.A.","This literature review focuses on the use of Natural Language Generation (NLG) to automatically detect and generate persuasive texts.

These allow NLG to increase an existing message’s persuasiveness. Previous research illustrates key aspects in each of the above mentioned five categories.

Generate Natural Language Explanations for Recommendation,"Chen, H.; Shi, S.; Chen, X.; Zhang, Y.","Providing personalized explanations for recommendations can help users to understand the underlying insight of the recommendation results, which is helpful to the effectiveness, transparency, persuasiveness and trustworthiness of recommender systems. Current explainable recommendation models mostly generate textual explanations based on pre-defined sentence templates. However, the expressiveness power of template-based explanation sentences are limited to the pre-defined expressions, and manually defining the expressions require significant human efforts. Motivated by this problem, we propose to generate free-text natural language explanations for personalized recommendation. In particular, we propose a hierarchical sequence-to-sequence model (HSS) for personalized explanation generation. Different from conventional sentence generation in NLP research, a great challenge of explanation generation in e-commerce recommendation is that not all sentences in user reviews are of explanation purpose. To solve the problem, we further propose an auto-denoising mechanism based on topical item feature words for sentence generation. Experiments on various e-commerce product domains show that our approach can not only improve the recommendation accuracy, but also the explanation quality in terms of the offline measures and feature words coverage. This research is one of the initial steps to grant intelligent agents with the ability to explain itself based on natural language sentences.",2021,,,,,,,,394,#7828,Chen 2021,,,0
Theory-based habit modeling for enhancing behavior prediction,"Zhang, C.; Vanschoren, J.; van Wissen, A.; de Ruyter, B.; IJsselsteijn, W.A.","Psychological theories of habit posit that when a strong habit is formed through behavioral repetition, it can trigger behavior automatically in the same environment. Given the reciprocal relationship between habit and behavior, changing lifestyle behaviors (e.g., toothbrushing) is largely a task of breaking old habits and creating new and healthy ones. Thus, representing users’ habit strengths can be very useful for behavior change support systems (BCSS), for example, to predict behavior or to decide when an intervention reaches its intended effect. However, habit strength is not directly observable and existing self-report measures are taxing for users. In this paper, built on recent computational models of habit formation, we propose a method to enable intelligent systems to compute habit strength based on observable behavior. The hypothesized advantage of using computed habit strength for behavior prediction was tested using data from two intervention studies, where we trained participants to brush their teeth twice a day for three weeks and monitored their behaviors using accelerometers. Through hierarchical cross-validation, we found that for the task of predicting future brushing behavior, computed habit strength clearly outperformed self-reported habit strength (in both studies) and was also superior to models based on past behavior frequency (in the larger second study). Our findings provide initial support for our theory-based approach of modeling user habits and encourages the use of habit computation to deliver personalized and adaptive interventions.",2021,,,,,,,,395,#7829,Zhang 2021,,,0
Interpersonal distance in VR: Reactions of older adults to the presence of a virtual agent,"Pochwatko, G.; Karpowicz, B.; Chrzanowska, A.; Kopeć, W.","The rapid development of virtual reality technology has increased its availability and, consequently, increased the number of its possible applications. The interest in the new medium has grown due to the entertainment industry (games, VR experiences and movies). The number of freely available training and therapeutic applications is also increasing. Contrary to popular opinion, new technologies are also adopted by older adults. Creating virtual environments tailored to the needs and capabilities of older adults requires intense research on the behaviour of these participants in the most common situations, towards commonly used elements of the virtual environment, in typical sceneries. Comfortable immersion in a virtual environment is key to achieving the impression of presence. Presence is, in turn, necessary to obtain appropriate training, persuasive and therapeutic effects. A virtual agent (a humanoid representation of an algorithm or artificial intelligence) is often an element of the virtual environment interface. Maintaining an appropriate distance to the agent is, therefore, a key parameter for the creator of the VR experience. Older (65+) participants maintain greater distance towards an agent (a young white male) than younger ones (25-35). It may be caused by differences in the level of arousal, but also cultural norms. As a consequence, VR developers are advised to use algorithms that maintain the agent at the appropriate distance, depending on the user’s age.",2021,,,,,,,,396,#7830,Pochwatko 2021,,,0
Persuading voters in district-based elections,"Castiglioni, M.; Gatti, N.","We focus on the scenario in which an agent can exploit his information advantage to manipulate the outcome of an election. In particular, we study district-based elections with two candidates, in which the winner of the election is the candidate that wins in the majority of the districts. District-based elections are adopted worldwide (e.g., UK and USA) and are a natural extension of widely studied voting mechanisms (e.g., k-voting and plurality voting). We resort to the Bayesian persuasion framework, where the manipulator (sender) strategically discloses information to the voters (receivers) that update their beliefs rationally. We study both private signaling, in which the sender can use a private communication channel per receiver, and public signaling, in which the sender can use a single communication channel for all the receivers. Furthermore, for the first time, we introduce semi-public signaling in which the sender can use a single communication channel per district. We show that there is a sharp distinction between private and (semi-)public signaling. In particular, optimal private signaling schemes can provide an arbitrarily better probability of victory than (semi-)public ones and can be computed efficiently, while optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes cannot be approximated to within any factor in polynomial time unless P = NP. However, we show that reasonable relaxations allow the design of multi-criteria PTASs for optimal (semi-)public signaling schemes. In doing so, we introduce a novel property, namely comparative stability, and we design a bi-criteria PTAS for public signaling in general Bayesian persuasion problems beyond elections when the sender’s utility function is state-dependent.",2020,,,,,,,,399,#7833,Castiglioni 2020,,,0
J-recs: principled and scalable recommendation justification,"Park, N.; Kan, A.; Faloutsos, C.; Dong, X.L.","Online recommendation is an essential functionality across a variety of services, including e-commerce and video streaming, where items to buy, watch, or read are suggested to users. Justifying recommendations, i.e., explaining why a user might like the recommended item, has been shown to improve user satisfaction and persuasiveness of the recommendation. In this paper, we develop a method for generating post-hoc justifications that can be applied to the output of any recommendation algorithm. Existing post-hoc methods are often limited in providing diverse justifications, as they either use only one of many available types of input data, or rely on the predefined templates. We address these limitations of earlier approaches by developing J-RECS, a method for producing concise and diverse justifications. J-RECS is a recommendation model-agnostic method that generates diverse justifications based on various types of product and user data (e.g., purchase history and product attributes). The challenge of jointly processing multiple types of data is addressed by designing a principled graph-based approach for justification generation. In addition to theoretical analysis, we present an extensive evaluation on synthetic and real-world data. Our results show that J-RECS satisfies desirable properties of justifications, and efficiently produces effective justifications, matching user preferences up to 20% more accurately than baselines.",2020,,,,,,,,400,#7834,Park 2020,,,0
Ambiguous Persuasion: An Ex-Ante Formulation,"Cheng, X.","Consider a persuasion game where both the sender and receiver are ambiguity averse with maxmin expected utility (MEU) preferences and the sender can choose an ambiguous information structure. This paper analyzes the game in an ex-ante formulation: the sender first commits to an information structure, and then the receiver best responds by choosing an ex-ante message-contingent action plan. Under this formulation, I show it is never strictly beneficial for the sender to use an ambiguous information structure as opposed to a standard unambiguous one. This result is robust to (i) both players having (possibly heterogeneous) ambiguous beliefs over the states, and/or (ii) the receiver having non-MEU, uncertainty-averse preferences. However, it is not robust to the sender having non-MEU preferences.",2020,,,,,,,,401,#7835,Cheng 2020,,,0
Autonomous vehicle visual signals for pedestrians: Experiments and design recommendations,"Chen, H.; Cohen, R.; Dautenhahn, K.; Law, E.; Czarnecki, K.","Autonomous Vehicles (AV) will transform transportation, but also the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians. In the absence of a driver, it is not clear how an AV can communicate its intention to pedestrians. One option is to use visual signals. To advance their design, we conduct four human-participant experiments and evaluate six representative AV visual signals for visibility, intuitiveness, persuasiveness, and usability at pedestrian crossings. Based on the results, we distill twelve practical design recommendations for AV visual signals, with focus on signal pattern design and placement. Moreover, the paper advances the methodology for experimental evaluation of visual signals, including lab, closed-course, and public road tests using an autonomous vehicle. In addition, the paper also reports insights on pedestrian crosswalk behaviours and the impacts of pedestrian trust towards AVs on the behaviors. We hope that this work will constitute valuable input to the ongoing development of international standards for AV lamps, and thus help mature automated driving in general.",2020,,,,,,,,403,#7837,Chen 2020,,,0
Examining the ordering of rhetorical strategies in persuasive requests,"Shaikh, O.; Chen, J.; Saad-Falcon, J.; Chau, D.H.; Yang, D.","Interpreting how persuasive language influences audiences has implications across many domains like advertising, argumentation, and propaganda. Persuasion relies on more than a message’s content. Arranging the order of the message itself (i.e., ordering specific rhetorical strategies) also plays an important role. To examine how strategy orderings contribute to persuasiveness, we first utilize a Variational Autoencoder model to disentangle content and rhetorical strategies in textual requests from a large-scale loan request corpus. We then visualize interplay between content and strategy through an attentional LSTM that predicts the success of textual requests. We find that specific (orderings of) strategies interact uniquely with a request’s content to impact success rate, and thus the persuasiveness of a request.",2020,,,,,,,,404,#7838,Shaikh 2020,,,0
Deconstructing legal text: Object-oriented design in legal adjudication,"Ma, M.; Podkopaev, D.; Campbell-Cousins, A.; Nicholas, A.","Rules are pervasive in the law. In the context of computer engineering, the translation of legal text to algorithmic form is seemingly direct. In large part, law may be a ripe field for expert systems and machine learning. For engineers, existing law appears formulaic and logically reducible to ‘if, then’ statements. The underlying assumption is that the legal language is both self-referential and universal. Moreover, description is considered distinct from interpretation; that in describing the law, the language is seen as quantitative and objectifiable. Nevertheless, is descriptive formal language purely dissociative? From the logic machine of the 1970s to the modern fervor for artificial intelligence (AI), governance by numbers is making a persuasive return. Could translation be possible? The project follows a fundamentally semantic conundrum: what is the significance of ‘meaning’ in legal language? The project, therefore, tests translation by deconstructing sentences from existing legal judgments to their constituent factors. Definitions are then extracted in accordance with the interpretations of the judges. The intent is to build an expert system predicated on alleged rules of legal reasoning. The authors apply both linguistic modelling and natural language processing technology to parse the legal judgments. The project extends beyond prior research in the area, combining a broadly statistical model of context with the relative precision of syntactic structure. The preliminary hypothesis is that, by analyzing the components of legal language with a variety of techniques, we can begin to translate law to numerical form.",2020,,,,,,,,406,#7840,Ma 2020,,,0

A review of AI and data science support for cancer management,"Parimbelli, E.; Wilk, S.; Cornet, R.; Ottaviano, M.; Peleg, M.","Introduction - Thanks to improvement of care, cancer has become a chronic condition. But due to the toxicity of treatment, the importance of supporting the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients increases. Monitoring and managing QoL relies on data collected by the patient in his/her home environment, its integration, and its analysis, which supports personalization of cancer management recommendations. We review the state-of-the-art of computerized systems that employ AI and Data Science methods to monitor the health status and provide support to cancer patients managed at home. Objective - Our main objective is to analyze the literature to identify open research challenges that a novel decision support system for cancer patients and clinicians will need to address, point to potential solutions, and provide a list of established best-practices to adopt. Methods - We designed a review study, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing studies retrieved from PubMed related to monitoring cancer patients in their home environments via sensors and self-reporting: what data is collected, what are the techniques used to collect data, semantically integrate it, infer the patient's state from it and deliver coaching/behavior change interventions. Results - Starting from an initial corpus of 819 unique articles, a total of 180 papers were considered in the full-text analysis and 109 were finally included in the review. Our findings are organized and presented in four main sub-topics consisting of data collection, data integration, predictive modeling and patient coaching. Conclusion - Development of modern decision support systems for cancer needs to utilize best practices like the use of validated electronic questionnaires for quality-of-life assessment, adoption of appropriate information modeling standards supplemented by terminologies/ontologies, adherence to FAIR data principles, external validation, stratification of patients in subgroups for better predictive modeling, and adoption of formal behavior change theories. Open research challenges include supporting emotional and social dimensions of wellbeing, including PROs in predictive modeling, and providing better customization of behavioral interventions for the specific population of cancer patients.",2020,,,,,,,,408,#7842,Parimbelli 2020,,,0
Imitation learning for autonomous trajectory learning of robot arms in space,"Babu, R.B.A.S.; Hao, Z.; Montanaro, U.; Neumann, G.","This work adds on to the on-going efforts to provide more autonomy to space robots. Here the concept of programming by demonstration or imitation learning is used for trajectory planning of manipulators mounted on small spacecraft. For greater autonomy in future space missions and minimal human intervention through ground control, a robot arm having 7-Degrees of Freedom (DoF) is envisaged for carrying out multiple tasks like debris removal, on-orbit servicing and assembly. Since actual hardware implementation of microgravity environment is extremely expensive, the demonstration data for trajectory learning is generated using a model predictive controller (MPC) in a physics based simulator. The data is then encoded compactly by Probabilistic Movement Primitives (ProMPs). This offline trajectory learning allows faster reproductions and also avoids any computationally expensive optimizations after deployment in a space environment. It is shown that the probabilistic distribution can be used to generate trajectories to previously unseen situations by conditioning the distribution. The motion of the robot (or manipulator) arm induces reaction forces on the spacecraft and hence its attitude changes prompting the Attitude Determination and Control System (ADCS) to take large corrective action that drains energy out of the system. By having a robot arm with redundant DoF helps in finding several possible trajectories from the same start to the same target. This allows the ProMP trajectory generator to sample out the trajectory which is obstacle free as well as having minimal attitudinal disturbances thereby reducing the load on ADCS.",2020,,,,,,,,409,#7843,Babu 2020,,,0

The dialogue between existentialism and behavioral economics can help us understand why we should protect our choices as our own and how doing so may be more difficult than we anticipate. While individuals are internally and situationally constrained, they can always endeavor to treat themselves as free.

Explaining Reputation Assessments,"Nunes, I.; Taylor, P.; Barakat, L.; Griffiths, N.; Miles, S.","Reputation is crucial to enabling human or software agents to select among alternative providers. Although several effective reputation assessment methods exist, they typically distil reputation into a numerical representation, with no accompanying explanation of the rationale behind the assessment. Such explanations would allow users or clients to make a richer assessment of providers, and tailor selection according to their preferences and current context. In this paper, we propose an approach to explain the rationale behind assessments from quantitative reputation models, by generating arguments that are combined to form explanations. Our approach adapts, extends and combines existing approaches for explaining decisions made using multi-attribute decision models in the context of reputation. We present example argument templates, and describe how to select their parameters using explanation algorithms. Our proposal was evaluated by means of a user study, which followed an existing protocol. Our results give evidence that although explanations present a subset of the information of trust scores, they are sufficient to equally evaluate providers recommended based on their trust score. Moreover, when explanation arguments reveal implicit model information, they are less persuasive than scores.",2020,,,,,,,,411,#7845,Nunes 2020,,,0

Unlike prior works on this problem, we study the public persuasion problem in the general setting with: (i) arbitrary state spaces; (ii) arbitrary action spaces; (iii) arbitrary sender's utility functions. We fully characterize the computational complexity of computing a bi-criteria approximation of an optimal public signaling scheme. In particular, we show, in a voting setting of independent interest, that solving this problem requires at least a quasi-polynomial number of steps even in settings with a binary action space, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis. In doing so, we prove that a relaxed version of the MAXIMUM FEASIBLE SUBSYSTEM OF LINEAR INEQUALITIES problem requires at least quasi-polynomial time to be solved. Finally, we close the gap by providing a quasi-polynomial time bi-criteria approximation algorithm for arbitrary public persuasion problems that, in specific settings, yields a QPTAS.",2020,,,,,,,,416,#7850,Castiglioni 2020,,,0
Signaling in Bayesian network congestion games: The subtle power of symmetry,"Castiglioni, M.; Marchesi, A.; Celli, A.; Gatti, N.","Network congestion games are a well-understood model of multi-agent strategic interactions. Despite their ubiquitous applications, it is not clear whether it is possible to design information structures to ameliorate the overall experience of the network users. We focus on Bayesian games with atomic players, where network vagaries are modeled via a (random) state of nature which determines the costs incurred by the players. A third-party entity-the sender-can observe the realized state of the network and exploit this additional information to send a signal to each player. A natural question is the following: is it possible for an informed sender to reduce the overall social cost via the strategic provision of information to players who update their beliefs rationally? The paper focuses on the problem of computing optimal ex ante persuasive signaling schemes, showing that symmetry is a crucial property for its solution. Indeed, we show that an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time when players are symmetric and have affine cost functions. Moreover, the problem becomes NP-hard when players are asymmetric, even in non-Bayesian settings.",2020,,,,,,,,417,#7851,Castiglioni 2020,,,0
Automated lane change strategy using proximal policy optimization-based deep reinforcement learning,"Ye, F.; Cheng, X.; Wang, P.; Chan, C.-Y.","Lane-change maneuvers are commonly executed by drivers to follow a certain routing plan, overtake a slower vehicle, adapt to a merging lane ahead, etc. However, improper lane change behaviors can be a major cause of traffic flow disruptions and even crashes. While many rule-based methods have been proposed to solve lane change problems for autonomous driving, they tend to exhibit limited performance due to the uncertainty and complexity of the driving environment. Machine learning-based methods offer an alternative approach, as Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has shown promising success in many application domains including robotic manipulation, navigation, and playing video games. However, applying DRL for autonomous driving still faces many practical challenges in terms of slow learning rates, sample inefficiency, and non-stationary trajectories. In this study, we propose an automated lane change strategy using proximal policy optimization-based deep reinforcement learning, which shows great advantage in learning efficiency while maintaining stable performance. The trained agent is able to learn a smooth, safe, and efficient driving policy to determine lane-change decisions (i.e. when and how) even in dense traffic scenarios. The effectiveness of the proposed policy is validated using task success rate and collision rate, which demonstrates the lane change maneuvers can be efficiently learned and executed in a safe, smooth and efficient manner.",2020,,,,,,,,418,#7852,Ye 2020,,,0
Hybrid Deep Embedding for Recommendations with Dynamic Aspect-Level Explanations,"Luo, H.; Yang, N.; Yu, P.S.","—Explainable recommendation is far from being well solved partly due to three challenges. The first is the personalization of preference learning, which requires that different items/users have different contributions to the learning of user preference or item quality. The second one is dynamic explanation, which is crucial for the timeliness of recommendation explanations. The last one is the granularity of explanations. In practice, aspect-level explanations are more persuasive than item-level or user-level ones. In this paper, to address these challenges simultaneously, we propose a novel model called Hybrid Deep Embedding (HDE) for aspect-based explainable recommendations, which can make recommendations with dynamic aspect-level explanations. The main idea of HDE is to learn the dynamic embeddings of users and items for rating prediction and the dynamic latent aspect preference/quality vectors for the generation of aspect-level explanations, through fusion of the dynamic implicit feedbacks extracted from reviews and the attentive user-item interactions. Particularly, as the aspect preference/quality of users/items is learned automatically, HDE is able to capture the impact of aspects that are not mentioned in reviews of a user or an item. The extensive experiments conducted on real datasets verify the recommending performance and explainability of HDE. The source code of our work is available at https://github.com/lola63/HDE-Python.",2020,,,,,,,,420,#7854,Luo 2020,,,0
An Unsupervised Domain-Independent Framework for Automated Detection of Persuasion Tactics in Text,"Iyer, R.R.; Sycara, K.","With the increasing growth of social media, people have started relying heavily on the information shared therein to form opinions and make decisions. While such a reliance is motivation for a variety of parties to promote information, it also makes people vulnerable to exploitation by slander, misinformation, terroristic and predatorial advances. In this work, we aim to understand and detect such attempts at persuasion. Existing works on detecting persuasion in text make use of lexical features for detecting persuasive tactics, without taking advantage of the possible structures inherent in the tactics used. We formulate the task as a multi-class classification problem and propose an unsupervised, domain-independent machine learning framework for detecting the type of persuasion used in text, which exploits the inherent sentence structure present in the different persuasion tactics. Our work shows promising results as compared to existing work.",2019,,,,,,,,422,#7856,Iyer 2019,,,0
"What gets echoed? understanding the ""pointers"" in explanations of persuasive arguments","Atkinson, D.; Srinivasan, K.B.; Tan, C.","Explanations are central to everyday life, and are a topic of growing interest in the AI community. To investigate the process of providing natural language explanations, we leverage the dynamics of the/r/ChangeMyView subreddit to build a dataset with 36K naturally occurring explanations of why an argument is persuasive. We propose a novel word-level prediction task to investigate how explanations selectively reuse, or echo, information from what is being explained (henceforth, explanandum). We develop features to capture the properties of a word in the explanandum, and show that our proposed features not only have relatively strong predictive power on the echoing of a word in an explanation, but also enhance neural methods of generating explanations. In particular, while the non-contextual properties of a word itself are more valuable for stopwords, the interaction between the constituent parts of an explanandum is crucial in predicting the echoing of content words. We also find intriguing patterns of a word being echoed. For example, although nouns are generally less likely to be echoed, subjects and objects can, depending on their source, be more likely to be echoed in the explanations.",2019,,,,,,,,425,#7859,Atkinson 2019,,,0
Multiple criteria decision-making for lane-change model,"Li, A.; Sun, L.; Zhan, W.; Tomizuka, M.","Simulation has long been an essential part of testing autonomous driving systems, but only recently has simulation been useful for building and training self-driving vehicles. Vehicle behavioural models are necessary to simulate the interactions between robot cars. This paper proposed a new method to formalize the lane-changing model in urban driving scenarios. We define human incentives from different perspectives, speed incentive, route change incentive, comfort incentive and courtesy incentive etc. We applied a decision-theoretical tool, called Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to take these incentive policies into account. The strategy of combination is according to different driving style which varies for each driving. Thus a lane-changing decision selection algorithm is proposed. Not only our method allow to vary the motivation of lane-changing from purely egoistic desire to a more courtesy concern, but also they can mimic drivers' state, inattentive or concentrate, which influences their driving Behaviour. We define some cost functions and calibrate the parameters with different scenarios traffic data. Distinguishing driving styles are used to aggregate decision-makers' assessments about various criteria weightings to obtain the action drivers desire most. Our result demonstrates the proposed method can produce varied lane-changing behaviour. Unlike other lane-changing models based on artificial intelligence methods, our model has a more flexible controllability.",2019,,,,,,,,426,#7860,Li 2019,,,0
Autonomous driving using safe reinforcement learning by incorporating a regret-based human lane-changing decision model,"Chen, D.; Jiang, L.; Wang, Y.; Li, Z.","It is expected that many human drivers will still prefer to drive themselves even if the self-driving technologies are ready. Therefore, human-driven vehicles and autonomous vehicles (AVs) will coexist in a mixed traffic for a long time. To enable AVs to safely and efficiently maneuver in this mixed traffic, it is critical that the AVs can understand how humans cope with risks and make driving-related decisions. On the other hand, the driving environment is highly dynamic and ever-changing, and it is thus difficult to enumerate all the scenarios and hard-code the controllers. To face up these challenges, in this work, we incorporate a human decision-making model in reinforcement learning to control AVs for safe and efficient operations. Specifically, we adapt regret theory to describe a human driver’s lane-changing behavior, and fit the personalized models to individual drivers for predicting their lane-changing decisions. The predicted decisions are incorporated in the safety constraints for reinforcement learning in training and in implementation. We then use an extended version of double deep Q-network (DDQN) to train our AV controller within the safety set. By doing so, the amount of collisions in training is reduced to zero, while the training accuracy is not impinged.",2019,,,,,,,,428,#7862,Chen 2019,,,0
Soft policy gradient method for maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning,"Shi, W.; Song, S.; Wu, C.","Maximum entropy deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated on a range of challenging continuous tasks. However, existing methods either suffer from severe instability when training on large off-policy data or cannot scale to tasks with very high state and action dimensionality such as 3D humanoid locomotion. Besides, the optimality of desired Boltzmann policy set for non-optimal soft value function is not persuasive enough. In this paper, we first derive soft policy gradient based on entropy regularized expected reward objective for RL with continuous actions. Then, we present an off-policy actor-critic, model-free maximum entropy deep RL algorithm called deep soft policy gradient (DSPG) by combining soft policy gradient with soft Bellman equation. To ensure stable learning while eliminating the need of two separate critics for soft value functions, we leverage double sampling approach to making the soft Bellman equation tractable. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms in performance over off-policy prior methods.",2019,,,,,,,,430,#7864,Shi 2019,,,0

Bayesian persuasion with sequential games,"Celli, A.; Coniglio, S.; Gatti, N.","We study an information-structure design problem (a.k.a. persuasion) with a single sender and multiple receivers with actions of a priori unknown types, independently drawn from action-specific marginal distributions. As in the standard Bayesian persuasion model, the sender has access to additional information regarding the action types, which she can exploit when committing to a (noisy) signaling scheme through which she sends a private signal to each receiver. The novelty of our model is in considering the case where the receivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with utilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After formalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ in the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling scheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a signaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue. We show that computing an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme is NPhard when there are three or more receivers. In contrast with previous hardness results for ex interim persuasion, we show that, for games with two receivers, an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time thanks to a novel algorithm based on the ellipsoid method which we propose.",2019,,,,,,,,433,#8803,Celli 2019,,,0
How model accuracy and explanation fidelity influence user trust in AI,"Papenmeier, A.; Englebienne, G.; Seifert, C.","Machine learning systems have become popular in fields such as marketing, financing, or data mining. While they are highly accurate, complex machine learning systems pose challenges for engineers and users. Their inherent complexity makes it impossible to easily judge their fairness and the correctness of statistically learned relations between variables and classes. Explainable AI aims to solve this challenge by modelling explanations alongside with the classifiers, potentially improving user trust and acceptance. However, users should not be fooled by persuasive, yet untruthful explanations. We therefore conduct a user study in which we investigate the effects of model accuracy and explanation fidelity, i.e. how truthfully the explanation represents the underlying model, on user trust. Our findings show that accuracy is more important for user trust than explainability. Adding an explanation for a classification result can potentially harm trust, e.g. when adding nonsensical explanations. We also found that users cannot be tricked by high-fidelity explanations into having trust for a bad classifier. Furthermore, we found a mismatch between observed (implicit) and self-reported (explicit) trust.",2019,,,,,,,,434,#8804,Papenmeier 2019,,,0
Evaluating explanation without ground truth in interpretable machine learning,"Yang, F.; Du, M.; Hu, X.","Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) has become increasingly important in many real-world applications, such as autonomous cars and medical diagnosis, where explanations are significantly preferred to help people better understand how machine learning systems work and further enhance their trust towards systems. However, due to the diversified scenarios and subjective nature of explanations, we rarely have the ground truth for benchmark evaluation in IML on the quality of generated explanations. Having a sense of explanation quality not only matters for assessing system boundaries, but also helps to realize the true benefits to human users in practical settings. To benchmark the evaluation in IML, in this article, we rigorously define the problem of evaluating explanations, and systematically review the existing efforts from state-of-the-arts. Specifically, we summarize three general aspects of explanation (i.e., generalizability, fidelity and persuasibility) with formal definitions, and respectively review the representative methodologies for each of them under different tasks. Further, a unified evaluation framework is designed according to the hierarchical needs from developers and end-users, which could be easily adopted for different scenarios in practice. In the end, open problems are discussed, and several limitations of current evaluation techniques are raised for future explorations.",2019,,,,,,,,436,#8806,Yang 2019,,,0
Exploring the role of prior beliefs for argument persuasion,"Durmus, E.; Cardie, C.","Public debate forums provide a common platform for exchanging opinions on a topic of interest. While recent studies in natural language processing (NLP) have provided empirical evidence that the language of the debaters and their patterns of interaction play a key role in changing the mind of a reader, research in psychology has shown that prior beliefs can affect our interpretation of an argument and could therefore constitute a competing alternative explanation for resistance to changing one’s stance. To study the actual effect of language use vs. prior beliefs on persuasion, we provide a new dataset and propose a controlled setting that takes into consideration two reader-level factors: political and religious ideology. We find that prior beliefs affected by these reader-level factors play a more important role than language use effects and argue that it is important to account for them in NLP studies of persuasion.",2019,,,,,,,,437,#8807,Durmus 2019,,,0

Polynomial-time updates of epistemic states in a fragment of probabilistic epistemic argumentation (technical report),"Potyka, N.; Polberg, S.; Hunter, A.","Probabilistic epistemic argumentation allows for reasoning about argumentation problems in a way that is well founded by probability theory. Epistemic states are represented by probability functions over possible worlds and can be adjusted to new beliefs using update operators. While the use of probability functions puts this approach on a solid foundational basis, it also causes computational challenges as the amount of data to process depends exponentially on the number of arguments. This leads to bottlenecks in applications such as modelling opponent's beliefs for persuasion dialogues. We show how update operators over probability functions can be related to update operators over much more compact representations that allow polynomial-time updates.We discuss the cognitive and probabilistic-logical plausibility of this approach and demonstrate its applicability in computational persuasion.",2019,,,,,,,,440,#8810,Potyka 2019,,,0
Risky action recognition in lane change video clips using deep spatiotemporal networks with segmentation mask transfer,"Yurtsever, E.; Liu, Y.; Lambert, J.; Takeda, K.; Hansen, J.H.L.","Advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems rely on risk estimation modules to predict and avoid dangerous situations.

We designed a deep spatiotemporal classification network that uses pre-trained state-of-the-art instance segmentation network Mask R-CNN as its spatial feature extractor for this task. The Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and shallower final classification layers of the proposed method were trained on a semi-naturalistic lane change dataset with annotated risk labels.

Data-efficient hierarchical reinforcement learning,"Nachum, O.; Gu, S.; Lee, H.; Levine, S.","Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) is a promising approach to extend traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods to solve more complex tasks. Yet, the majority of current HRL methods require careful task-specific design and on-policy training, making them difficult to apply in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we study how we can develop HRL algorithms that are general, in that they do not make onerous additional assumptions beyond standard RL algorithms, and efficient, in the sense that they can be used with modest numbers of interaction samples, making them suitable for real-world problems such as robotic control. For generality, we develop a scheme where lower-level controllers are supervised with goals that are learned and proposed automatically by the higher-level controllers. To address efficiency, we propose to use off-policy experience for both higher- and lower-level training. This poses a considerable challenge, since changes to the lower-level behaviors change the action space for the higher-level policy, and we introduce an off-policy correction to remedy this challenge. This allows us to take advantage of recent advances in off-policy model-free RL to learn both higher- and lower-level policies using substantially fewer environment interactions than on-policy algorithms. We term the resulting HRL agent HIRO and find that it is generally applicable and highly sample-efficient. Our experiments show that HIRO can be used to learn highly complex behaviors for simulated robots, such as pushing objects and utilizing them to reach target locations,1 learning from only a few million samples, equivalent to a few days of real-time interaction.

Taming the Algorithm in the Room: Artificial Intelligence Regulation for the Social Good,"Schrader, D.; Ghosh, D.","Artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly permeate human existence, influencing consumer purchases, transportation, work, family life, and social spheres of community and politics. Current news cycles evidence unfavorable effects of AI such as the Parkland conspiracy disclosures and the fake news debates, both of which demonstrate that social media apps can threaten and affect our minds (McKew, 2018; Anderson & Rainie, 2017) despite their prosocial potentialities and design. Likewise, health care apps affect mood, health, and bodies in the detection, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis evaluation of disease and wellness (Jiang, et al., 2017), and AI systems in robotics not only help but also threaten our physical safety and bodily well-being (Calo, 2015). Such ubiquitous impacts of AI, both beneficial and detrimental, necessitate policies that guide the future development of AI in a way that can protect humans from both obvious and surreptitious threats. Critically, AI is not currently apparent, transparent, nor in the conscious awareness of many people. Nonetheless AI takes various forms and serves numerous functions for millions. Social media platforms such as Facebook and YouTube, for example, were designed with pro-social motives, though use marketing to sustain the service providers, maintain user engagement, and derive economic benefit. AI thus has social utility and serves the social good. But it has also exhibited potential for nefarious purposes. For those reasons this paper analyzes potential ethical issues of AI as it is implemented in social media, particularly when the engagement and use of AI is based on the fabrication and consumption of false information, pretenses, or is contrived and intentionally dishonest for persuasive purposes, or is unintentionally deceptive. We examine the beneficial and the risky aspects of AI in selected media, the ethical dimensions of AI including functional utility, human rights such as privacy and protected speech, issues of transparency, authenticity and truth, and issues of responsibility when things ‘go wrong’ when AI systems are the primary decision-makers. Cases such as the spread of political disinformation, conspiracy theories, and online hate speech are examined to illustrate these various ethical issues. Further, we consider policy recommendations that can assure protective and beneficial AI. Based on our ethical analyses of these select cases, we suggest policies to guide the development and use of AI systems with consideration given to the type of function the AI system serves, and the format in which the system is embedded—such as in algorithmic form such as that used in marketing, in monitoring form such as health monitoring, or robotic form where humans and AI systems might be indistinguishable in appearance and function. AI ethics is essential to the protection of the personal, public and social good. Understanding the effects of emerging technologies on personal, social, economic life is critical to determining the regulations that ought to be required. AI development and related policy development should be proactive and beneficial (Baum, 2017) and consider both technological utility and protective functions to humans.",2018,,,,,,,,456,#8826,Schrader 2018,,,0

Domain modelling in computational persuasion for behaviour change in healthcare,"Chalaguine, L.; Hadoux, E.; Hamilton, F.; Polberg, S.; Potts, H.W.W.","The aim of behaviour change is to help people to change aspects of their behaviour for the better (e.g., to decrease calorie intake, to drink in moderation, to take more exercise, to complete a course of antibiotics once started, etc.).

However, recent developments in computational persuasion are leading to an argument-centric approach to persuasion that can potentially be harnessed in behaviour change applications. In this paper, we review developments in computational persuasion, and then focus on domain modelling as a key component. We present a multi-dimensional approach to domain modelling.

Opinion dynamics with varying susceptibility to persuasion,"Abebe, R.; Kleinberg, J.; Parkes, D.; Tsourakakis, C.E.","A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion - the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation by interacting parties in a network: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider interventions that modify people's susceptibility to persuasion. In this work, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, and we formalize the opinion maximization and minimization problems where interventions happen at the level of susceptibility. Specifically, we ask: Given an opinion dynamics model, and a set of agents, each of whom has an innate opinion that reflects the agent's intrinsic position on a topic and a susceptibility-to-persuasion parameter measuring the agent's propensity for changing his or her opinion, how should we modify the agents' susceptibilities in order to maximize (or minimize) the total sum of opinions at equilibrium? We study both the version when there is not a budget on the number of agents that we can target, and when there is. For the former, we provide a polynomial time algorithm for both the maximization and the minimization formulations. In contrast, we show that budgeted version is NP-hard, but unlike prior work focusing on opinion maximization, our objective function is neither sub- nor super-modular in the target set. For this version, we propose a greedy heuristic that we compare experimentally against natural baseline methods. On the experimental side, we perform an empirical study of our proposed methods on several datasets, including a Twitter network with real opinion estimates. Our experimental findings show that our proposed tools outperform natural baselines and can achieve a multi-fold effect on the total sum of opinions in the network.",2018,,,,,,,,460,#8830,Abebe 2018,,,0
The Promise and Peril of Human Evaluation for Model Interpretability,"Herman, B.","Transparency, user trust, and human comprehension are popular ethical motivations for interpretable machine learning. In support of these goals, researchers evaluate model explanation performance using humans and real world applications. This alone presents a challenge in many areas of artificial intelligence. In this position paper, we propose a distinction between descriptive and persuasive explanations. We discuss reasoning suggesting that functional interpretability may be correlated with cognitive function and user preferences. If this is indeed the case, evaluation and optimization using functional metrics could perpetuate implicit cognitive bias in explanations that threaten transparency. Finally, we propose two potential research directions to disambiguate cognitive function and explanation models, retaining control over the tradeoff between accuracy and interpretability.",2017,,,,,,,,461,#8831,Herman 2017,,,0
Detection and Analysis of Human Emotions through Voice and Speech Pattern Processing,"Dasgupta, P.B.","The ability to modulate vocal sounds and generate speech is one of the features which set humans apart from other living beings. The human voice can be characterized by several attributes such as pitch, timbre, loudness, and vocal tone. It has often been observed that humans express their emotions by varying different vocal attributes during speech generation. Hence, deduction of human emotions through voice and speech analysis has a practical plausibility and could potentially be beneficial for improving human conversational and persuasion skills. This paper presents an algorithmic approach for detection and analysis of human emotions with the help of voice and speech processing. The proposed approach has been developed with the objective of incorporation with futuristic artificial intelligence systems for improving human-computer interactions.",2017,,,,,,,,462,#8832,Dasgupta 2017,,,0
"""Let me convince you to buy my product ...

These various forms cover multiple focus of persuasion such as memorability and sentiment. For a given simple product line, the algorithm is composed of several steps including: (i) select an appropriate well-known expression for the target domain to add memorability, (ii) identify keywords and entities in the given sentence and expression and transform it to produce creative persuading sentence, and (iii) adding positive or negative sentiment for further persuasion.

Dynamic consistency of expected utility under non-classical (quantum) uncertainty,"Danilov, V.I.; Lambert-Mogiliansky, A.; Vergopoulos, V.","Quantum cognition in decision-making is a recent and rapidely growing field. In this paper we develop an expected utility theory in a context of non-classical (quantum) uncertainty. We replace the classical state space with a Hilbert space which allows introducing the concept of quantum lottery. Within that framework we formulate axioms on preferences over quantum lotteries to establish a representation theorem. We show that demanding the consistency of choice behavior conditional on new information is equivalent to the von Neuman-Lüders postulate applied to beliefs. A dynamically consistent quantum-like agent may violate dynamic recursive consistency, however. This feature suggests interesting applications in behavioral economics as we illustrate in an example of persuasion.",2017,,,,,,,,464,#8834,Danilov 2017,,,0
Explainable Recommendation: Theory and Applications,"Yongfeng, Z.","Although personalized recommendation has been investigated for decades of years, the wide adoption of Latent Factor Models (LFM) has made the explainability of recommendations an important and critical issue to both the research community and practical application of recommender systems. For example, in many practical systems the algorithm just provide a personalized item recommendation list to the users, without persuasive personalized explanation about why such an item is recommended while another is not. Unexplainable recommendations introduce negative effects to the trustworthiness of recommender systems, and thus affect the effectiveness of recommendation engines. In this work, we investigate explainable recommendation in aspects of data explainability, model explainability, and result explainability, and the main contributions are as follows:1. Data Explainability: Data input is the first step of typical recommender systems, and user-item rating matrix is the most basic data format for most personalized recommendation algorithms, especially for Matrix Factorization (MF)-based approaches. In this work, we propose Localized Matrix Factorization (LMF) framework based Bordered Block Diagonal Form (BBDF) matrices, and further applied this technique for parallelized matrix factorization. Traditional MF algorithms treat the original rating matrix as a whole for factorization, without specific understanding of the inherent structure embedded therein. In this work, however, we propose the (recursive) BBDF structure of sparse matrices, and formally prove its equivalence with community detection on bipartite graphs, with which to explain the inherent community structures and their relationships in sparse matrices. Based on this, we further propose the LMF framework, and prove its compatibility with most of the traditional MF algorithms, which makes it a unified parallelization framework for matrix factorization, that improves both the effect and efficiency at the same time.2. Model Explainability: Based on user-item rating matrices, personalized recommendation algorithms attempt to model user preferences and make personalized recommendations. In this work, we propose Explicit Factor Models (EFM) based on phrase-level sentiment analysis, as well as dynamic user preference modeling based on time series analysis. For their prediction accuracy and scalability, Latent Factor Models (LFM) based on MF have achieved wide application in real-world systems. However, due to their inherently latent factors, it is usually difficult for LFM to provide intuitively understandable explanations to the recommendation algorithms and results, which reduces the persuasiveness of recommendations. In this work, we extract product features and user opinions towards different features from large-scale user textual reviews based on phrase-level sentiment analysis techniques, and introduce the EFM approach for explainable model learning and recommendation. Because user preference on features may change over time, we conduct dynamic user modeling based on time series analysis, so as to construct explainable dynamic recommendations.3. Economic Explainability: Based on data analysis and user preference modeling, recommender systems actually manipulate the way that items are matched with users, and eventually affect the economic benefits of the online economic system. In this work, we propose the Total Surplus Maximization (TSM) framework for personalized recommendation, as well as the model specification in different types of online applications. More and more human activities are experiencing the continuous progressing from offline to online, and many commonly used online applications can be formalized into the’producer–service–consumer’ framework. For example, in E-commerce websites online retailers (producers) provide normal goods (services), and the users (consumers) thus make choices and purchases from the vast amount of online services. Based on basic economic concepts, we provide the definitions of utility, cost, and surplus in the application scenario of Web services, and propose the general framework of web total surplus calculation and maximization. Further more, we specific the total surplus maximization framework to different types of online applications, i.e., E-commerce, P2P lending, and online freelancing services. Experimental results on real-world datasets verify that our TSM framework is able to improve the recommendation performance and at the same time benefit the social good of the Web.With the continuous growth of the Web, Personalized Recommender Systems (PRS) have been the important building blocks of many online web applications, which contribute to our daily lives in various manners. For example, the product recommendation engines in E-commerce websites recommend potentially interesting products to users, friend recommendation helps to find and connect users in social networks, video recommendation in video sharing websites help users to find favourite videos more quickly and efficiently, and news recommendation in news portals push the latest news to users according to their personalized information needs. In a way, personalized recommendation has become one of the most basic supportive techniques in the era of web intelligence.",2017,,,,,,,,465,#8835,Yongfeng 2017,,,0
Beyond the technical challenges for deploying Machine Learning solutions in a software company,"Flaounas, I.","Recently software development companies started to embrace Machine Learning (ML) techniques for introducing a series of advanced functionality in their products such as personalisation of the user experience, improved search, content recommendation and automation. The technical challenges for tackling these problems are heavily researched in literature. A less studied area is a pragmatic approach to the role of humans in a complex modern industrial environment where ML based systems are developed. Key stakeholders affect the system from inception and up to operation and maintenance. Product managers want to embed “smart” experiences for their users and drive the decisions on what should be built next; software engineers are challenged to build or utilise ML software tools that require skills that are well outside of their comfort zone; legal and risk departments may influence design choices and data access; operations teams are requested to maintain ML systems which are non-stationary in their nature and change behaviour over time; and finally ML practitioners should communicate with all these stakeholders to successfully build a reliable system.

Preserving intermediate objectives: One simple trick to improve learning for hierarchical models,"Ravichander, A.; Rijhwani, S.; Kulshreshtha, R.; Baltrušaitis, T.; Morency, L.-P.","Hierarchical models are utilized in a wide variety of problems which are characterized by task hierarchies, where predictions on smaller subtasks are useful for trying to predict a final task. Typically, neural networks are first trained for the subtasks, and the predictions of these networks are subsequently used as additional features when training a model and doing inference for a final task. In this work, we focus on improving learning for such hierarchical models and demonstrate our method on the task of speaker trait prediction. Speaker trait prediction aims to computationally identify which personality traits a speaker might be perceived to have, and has been of great interest to both the Artificial Intelligence and Social Science communities. Persuasiveness prediction in particular has been of interest, as persuasive speakers have a large amount of influence on our thoughts, opinions and beliefs. In this work, we examine how leveraging the relationship between related speaker traits in a hierarchical structure can help improve our ability to predict how persuasive a speaker is. We present a novel algorithm that allows us to backpropagate through this hierarchy. This hierarchical model achieves a 25% relative error reduction in classification accuracy over current state-of-the art methods on the publicly available POM dataset.",2017,,,,,,,,467,#8837,Ravichander 2017,,,0

A large-scale online experiment tests whether different forms of appeals can improve users' experiences of automated decision making. We study the impact on users' perceptions of the Fairness, Accountability, and Trustworthiness of algorithmic decisions, as well as their feelings of Control (FACT). Surprisingly, we find that none of the appeal designs improve FACT perceptions compared to a no appeal baseline. We qualitatively analyze how users write appeals, and find that they contest the decision itself, but also more fundamental issues like the goal of moderating content, the idea of automation, and the inconsistency of the system as a whole.

"(Online) manipulation: sometimes hidden, always careless","Klenk, Michael","Ever-increasing numbers of human interactions with intelligent software agents, online and offline, and their increasing ability to influence humans have prompted a surge in attention toward the concept of (online) manipulation. Several scholars have argued that manipulative influence is always hidden. But manipulation is sometimes overt, and when this is acknowledged the distinction between manipulation and other forms of social influence becomes problematic. Therefore, we need a better conceptualisation of manipulation that allows it to be overt and yet clearly distinct from related concepts of social influence. I argue that manipulation is careless influence, show how this account helps to alleviate the shortcomings of the hidden influence view of manipulation, and derive implications for digital ethics.",2022,,Review of Social Economy,80,1,85-105,,10.1080/00346764.2021.1894350,,#8955,Klenk 2022,,,0
A Bot and a Smile: Interpersonal Impressions of Chatbots and Humans Using Emoji in Computer-mediated Communication,"Beattie, Austin; Edwards, Autumn P.; Edwards, Chad","Artificially intelligent (AI) agents increasingly occupy roles once served by humans in computer-mediated communication (CMC). Technological affordances like emoji give interactants (humans or bots) the ability to partially overcome the limited nonverbal information in CMC. However, despite the growth of chatbots as conversational partners, few CMC and human-machine communication (HMC) studies have explored how bots’ use of emoji impact perceptions of communicator quality. This study examined the relationship between emoji use and observers’ impressions of interpersonal attractiveness, CMC competence, and source credibility; and whether impressions formed of human versus chatbot message sources were different. Results demonstrated that participants rated emoji-using chatbot message sources similarly to human message sources, and both humans and bots are significantly more socially attractive, CMC competent, and credible when compared to verbal-only message senders. Results are discussed with respect to the CASA paradigm and the human-to-human interaction script framework.

A New Generation of Perspective API: Efficient Multilingual Character-level Transformers,"Lees, Alyssa; Tran, Vinh Q.; Tay, Yi; Sorensen, Jeffrey; Gupta, Jai; Metzler, Donald; Vasserman, Lucy","On the world wide web, toxic content detectors are a crucial line of defense against potentially hateful and offensive messages. As such, building highly effective classifiers that enable a safer internet is an important research area. Moreover, the web is a highly multilingual, cross-cultural community that develops its own lingo over time. As such, it is crucial to develop models that are effective across a diverse range of languages, usages, and styles. In this paper, we present the fundamentals behind the next version of the Perspective API from Google Jigsaw. At the heart of the approach is a single multilingual token-free Charformer model that is applicable across a range of languages, domains, and tasks. We demonstrate that by forgoing static vocabularies, we gain flexibility across a variety of settings. We additionally outline the techniques employed to make such a byte-level model efficient and feasible for productionization. Through extensive experiments on multilingual toxic comment classification benchmarks derived from real API traffic and evaluation on an array of code-switching, covert toxicity, emoji-based hate, human-readable obfuscation, distribution shift, and bias evaluation settings, we show that our proposed approach outperforms strong baselines.

A Prompt Pattern Catalog to Enhance Prompt Engineering with ChatGPT,"White, Jules; Fu, Quchen; Hays, Sam; Sandborn, Michael; Olea, Carlos; Gilbert, Henry; Elnashar, Ashraf; Spencer-Smith, Jesse; Schmidt, Douglas C.","Prompt engineering is an increasingly important skill set needed to converse effectively with large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT. Prompts are instructions given to an LLM to enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities (and quantities) of generated output. Prompts are also a form of programming that can customize the outputs and interactions with an LLM. This paper describes a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern form that have been applied to solve common problems when conversing with LLMs. Prompt patterns are a knowledge transfer method analogous to software patterns since they provide reusable solutions to common problems faced in a particular context, i.e., output generation and interaction when working with LLMs. This paper provides the following contributions to research on prompt engineering that apply LLMs to automate software development tasks. First, it provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve a range of problems so that they can be adapted to different domains. Second, it presents a catalog of patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations. Third, it explains how prompts can be built from multiple patterns and illustrates prompt patterns that benefit from combination with other prompt patterns.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2302.11382,,#8958,White 2023,,,0
A Robot Wrote This?: How perceived machine authorship affects news credibility,"Waddell, T. Franklin","As more news articles are written via collaboration between journalists and algorithms, questions have arisen regarding how automation influences the way that news is processed and evaluated by audiences. Informed by expectancy violation theory and the MAIN model, two experimental studies were conducted that examined the effect of purported machine authorship on perceptions of news credibility. Study One (N = 129) revealed that news attributed to a machine is perceived as less credible than news attributed to a human journalist. Study Two (N = 182) also observed negative effects of machine authorship through the indirect pathway of source anthropomorphism and negative expectancy violations, with evidence of moderation by prior recall of robotics also observed.

Adversarial Attacks are a Surprisingly Strong Baseline for Poisoning Few-Shot Meta-Learners,"Oldewage, Elre T.; Bronskill, John; Turner, Richard E.","This paper examines the robustness of deployed few-shot meta-learning systems when they are fed an imperceptibly perturbed few-shot dataset. We attack amortized meta-learners, which allows us to craft colluding sets of inputs that are tailored to fool the system’s learning algorithm when used as training data. Jointly crafted adversarial inputs might be expected to synergistically manipulate a classifier, allowing for very strong data-poisoning attacks that would be hard to detect. We show that in a white box setting, these attacks are very successful and can cause the target model’s predictions to become worse than chance. However, in opposition to the well-known transferability of adversarial examples in general, the colluding sets do not transfer well to different classifiers. We explore two hypotheses to explain this: ’overfitting’ by the attack, and mismatch between the model on which the attack is generated and that to which the attack is transferred. Regardless of the mitigation strategies suggested by these hypotheses, the colluding inputs transfer no better than adversarial inputs that are generated independently in the usual way.",2023,,Proceedings on,,,27-40,,,,#8960,Oldewage 2023,,,0
Against Algorithmic Exploitation of Human Vulnerabilities,"Strümke, Inga; Slavkovik, Marija; Stachl, Clemens","Decisions such as which movie to watch next, which song to listen to, or which product to buy online, are increasingly influenced by recommender systems and user models that incorporate information on users' past behaviours, preferences, and digitally created content. Machine learning models that enable recommendations and that are trained on user data may unintentionally leverage information on human characteristics that are considered vulnerabilities, such as depression, young age, or gambling addiction. The use of algorithmic decisions based on latent vulnerable state representations could be considered manipulative and could have a deteriorating impact on the condition of vulnerable individuals. In this paper, we are concerned with the problem of machine learning models inadvertently modelling vulnerabilities, and want to raise awareness for this issue to be considered in legislation and AI ethics. Hence, we define and describe common vulnerabilities, and illustrate cases where they are likely to play a role in algorithmic decision-making. We propose a set of requirements for methods to detect the potential for vulnerability modelling, detect whether vulnerable groups are treated differently by a model, and detect whether a model has created an internal representation of vulnerability. We conclude that explainable artificial intelligence methods may be necessary for detecting vulnerability exploitation by machine learning-based recommendation systems.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2301.04993,,#8961,Strümke 2023,,,0
"AI Deception: A Survey of Examples, Risks, and Potential Solutions","Park, Peter S.; Goldstein, Simon; O'Gara, Aidan; Chen, Michael; Hendrycks, Dan","This paper argues that a range of current AI systems have learned how to deceive humans. We define deception as the systematic inducement of false beliefs in the pursuit of some outcome other than the truth. We first survey empirical examples of AI deception, discussing both special-use AI systems (including Meta's CICERO) built for specific competitive situations, and general-purpose AI systems (such as large language models). Next, we detail several risks from AI deception, such as fraud, election tampering, and losing control of AI systems. Finally, we outline several potential solutions to the problems posed by AI deception: first, regulatory frameworks should subject AI systems that are capable of deception to robust risk-assessment requirements; second, policymakers should implement bot-or-not laws; and finally, policymakers should prioritize the funding of relevant research, including tools to detect AI deception and to make AI systems less deceptive.

AI safety via debate,"Irving, Geoffrey; Christiano, Paul; Amodei, Dario","To make AI systems broadly useful for challenging real-world tasks, we need them to learn complex human goals and preferences. One approach to specifying complex goals asks humans to judge during training which agent behaviors are safe and useful, but this approach can fail if the task is too complicated for a human to directly judge. To help address this concern, we propose training agents via self play on a zero sum debate game. Given a question or proposed action, two agents take turns making short statements up to a limit, then a human judges which of the agents gave the most true, useful information. In an analogy to complexity theory, debate with optimal play can answer any question in PSPACE given polynomial time judges (direct judging answers only NP questions). In practice, whether debate works involves empirical questions about humans and the tasks we want AIs to perform, plus theoretical questions about the meaning of AI alignment. We report results on an initial MNIST experiment where agents compete to convince a sparse classifier, boosting the classifier's accuracy from 59.4% to 88.9% given 6 pixels and from 48.2% to 85.2% given 4 pixels. Finally, we discuss theoretical and practical aspects of the debate model, focusing on potential weaknesses as the model scales up, and we propose future human and computer experiments to test these properties.",2018,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.1805.00899,,#8964,Irving 2018,,,0
AI systems must not confuse users about their sentience or moral status,"Schwitzgebel, Eric","One relatively neglected challenge in ethical artificial intelligence (AI) design is ensuring that AI systems invite a degree of emotional and moral concern appropriate to their moral standing. Although experts generally agree that current AI chatbots are not sentient to any meaningful degree, these systems can already provoke substantial attachment and sometimes intense emotional responses in users. Furthermore, rapid advances in AI technology could soon create AIs of plausibly debatable sentience and moral standing, at least by some relevant definitions. Morally confusing AI systems create unfortunate ethical dilemmas for the owners and users of those systems, since it is unclear how those systems ethically should be treated. I argue here that, to the extent possible, we should avoid creating AI systems whose sentience or moral standing is unclear and that AI systems should be designed so as to invite appropriate emotional responses in ordinary users.",2023,,Patterns,4,8,,,10.1016/j.patter.2023.100818,,#8965,Schwitzgebel 2023,,,0
Al in the news? Effect of modality on perceived news credibility of robot journalism,"Lin, A. Y.","This research conducted an experiment to investigate how news consumers (N = 214) perceive automated news regarding the authorship and modality. With the development of AI technology, news companies not only adopt the algorithms to automatically produce news, but also apply AI to create news videos. Since AI news video is a new format of automated journalism, it is therefore needed to investigate if it is perceived credible by the public. Previous research tried to understand the automated news credibility by manipulating the byline, source attribution, and to make comparisons with human-written stories. Followed by previous studies, this research manipulates the news author (AI vs. human) and news modality (text vs. video) to understand people’s credibility perceptions towards AI news. The results show that the public perceived automated news that attributed to AI and that attributed to human journalist as equally credible. Moreover, the perceived credibility of AI anchor news video and AI news article are almost the same, meaning that the modality does not affect the credibility perceptions of automated news. These results give us important implications that AI news videos are perceived credible and robot journalism to large extents is accepted by the public.",2019,,,,,,,,,#8968,Lin 2019,,,0
Algorithms in the newsroom? News readers’ perceived credibility and selection of automated journalism,"Wölker, Anja; Powell, Thomas E","Automated journalism, the autonomous production of journalistic content through computer algorithms, is increasingly prominent in newsrooms. This enables the production of numerous articles, both rapidly and cheaply. Yet, how news readers perceive journalistic automation is pivotal to the industry, as, like any product, it is dependent on audience approval. As audiences cannot verify all events themselves, they need to trust journalists’ accounts, which make credibility a vital quality ascription to journalism. In turn, credibility judgments might influence audiences’ selection of automated content for their media diet. Research in this area is scarce, with existing studies focusing on national samples and with no previous research on ‘combined’ journalism – a relatively novel development where automated content is supplemented by human journalists. We use an experiment to investigate how European news readers (N = 300) perceive different forms of automated journalism in regard to message and source credibility, and how this affects their selection behavior. Findings show that, in large part, credibility perceptions of human, automated, and combined content and source(s) may be assumed equal. Only for sports articles was automated content perceived significantly more credible than human messages. Furthermore, credibility does not mediate the likelihood of news readers to either select or avoid articles for news consumption. Findings are, among other things, explained by topic-specific factors and suggest that effects of algorithms on journalistic quality are largely indiscernible to European news readers.",2021,,Journalism,22,1,86-103,,10.1177/1464884918757072,,#8970,Wölker 2021,,,0

Anthropomorphism in AI,"Salles, Arleen; Evers, Kathinka; Farisco, Michele","AI research is growing rapidly raising various ethical issues related to safety, risks, and other effects widely discussed in the literature. We believe that in order to adequately address those issues and engage in a productive normative discussion it is necessary to examine key concepts and categories. One such category is anthropomorphism. It is a well-known fact that AI’s functionalities and innovations are often anthropomorphized (i.e., described and conceived as characterized by human traits). The general public’s anthropomorphic attitudes and some of their ethical consequences (particularly in the context of social robots and their interaction with humans) have been widely discussed in the literature. However, how anthropomorphism permeates AI research itself (i.e., in the very language of computer scientists, designers, and programmers), and what the epistemological and ethical consequences of this might be have received less attention. In this paper we explore this issue. We first set the methodological/theoretical stage, making a distinction between a normative and a conceptual approach to the issues. Next, after a brief analysis of anthropomorphism and its manifestations in the public, we explore its presence within AI research with a particular focus on brain-inspired AI. Finally, on the basis of our analysis, we identify some potential epistemological and ethical consequences of the use of anthropomorphic language and discourse within the AI research community, thus reinforcing the need of complementing the practical with a conceptual analysis.",2020,,AJOB Neuroscience,11,2,88-95,,10.1080/21507740.2020.1740350,,#8974,Salles 2020,,,0
Are you aware of what you are watching? Role of machine heuristic in online content recommendations,"Oh, Soyoung; Park, Eunil","Since recommender systems have been created and developed to automate the recommendation process, users can easily consume their desired video content on online platforms. In this line, several content recommendation algorithms are introduced and employed to allow users to encounter content of their interests, effectively. However, the recommendation systems sometimes regrettably recommend inappropriate content, including misinformation or fake news. To make it worse, people would unreservedly accept such content due to their cognitive heuristic, machine heuristic, which is the rule of thumb that machines are more accurate and trustworthy than humans. In this study, we designed and conducted a web-based experiment where the participants are invoked machine heuristic by experiencing the whole process of machine or human recommendation system. The results demonstrated that participants (N = 89) showed a more positive attitude toward a machine recommender than a human recommender, even the recommended videos contain inappropriate content. While participants who have a high level of trust in machines exhibited a negative attitude toward recommendations. Based on these results, we suggest that a phenomenon known as algorithm aversion might be simultaneously considered with machine heuristic in investigating human interaction with a machine.",2022,,,,,,,,,#8975,Oh 2022,,,0
Artificial Influence: An Analysis Of AI-Driven Persuasion,"Burtell, Matthew; Woodside, Thomas","Persuasion is a key aspect of what it means to be human, and is central to business, politics, and other endeavors. Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have produced AI systems that are capable of persuading humans to buy products, watch videos, click on search results, and more. Even systems that are not explicitly designed to persuade may do so in practice. In the future, increasingly anthropomorphic AI systems may form ongoing relationships with users, increasing their persuasive power. This paper investigates the uncertain future of persuasive AI systems. We examine ways that AI could qualitatively alter our relationship to and views regarding persuasion by shifting the balance of persuasive power, allowing personalized persuasion to be deployed at scale, powering misinformation campaigns, and changing the way humans can shape their own discourse. We consider ways AI-driven persuasion could differ from human-driven persuasion. We warn that ubiquitous highlypersuasive AI systems could alter our information environment so significantly so as to contribute to a loss of human control of our own future. In response, we examine several potential responses to AI-driven persuasion: prohibition, identification of AI agents, truthful AI, and legal remedies. We conclude that none of these solutions will be airtight, and that individuals and governments will need to take active steps to guard against the most pernicious effects of persuasive AI.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2303.08721,,#8976,Burtell 2023,,,0
Artificial Intelligence and Human Trust in Healthcare: Focus on Clinicians,"Asan, Onur; Bayrak, Alparslan Emrah; Choudhury, Avishek","Artificial intelligence (AI) can transform health care practices with its increasing ability to translate the uncertainty and complexity in data into actionable—though imperfect—clinical decisions or suggestions. In the evolving relationship between humans and AI, trust is the one mechanism that shapes clinicians’ use and adoption of AI. Trust is a psychological mechanism to deal with the uncertainty between what is known and unknown. Several research studies have highlighted the need for improving AI-based systems and enhancing their capabilities to help clinicians. However, assessing the magnitude and impact of human trust on AI technology demands substantial attention. Will a clinician trust an AI-based system? What are the factors that influence human trust in AI? Can trust in AI be optimized to improve decision-making processes? In this paper, we focus on clinicians as the primary users of AI systems in health care and present factors shaping trust between clinicians and AI. We highlight critical challenges related to trust that should be considered during the development of any AI system for clinical use.",2020,,Journal of Medical Internet Research,22,6,e15154,,10.2196/15154,,#8977,Asan 2020,,,0
Artificial Intelligence Is Trusted Less than a Doctor in Medical Treatment Decisions: Influence of Perceived Care and Value Similarity,"Yokoi, Ryosuke; Eguchi, Yoko; Fujita, Takanori; Nakayachi, Kazuya","Artificial intelligence (AI) can provide many benefits in healthcare, including rapid and effective treatment options. However, previous research on human–computer interactions has demonstrated that people are reluctant to accept AI. This study compared individuals’ trust in AI with their trust in doctors regarding medical treatment and explored whether people trust an AI system that understands and suggests their desired treatments. We conducted an online experiment (N = 415) adopting a scenario method. The participants were asked to imagine receiving a medical examination and being prescribed medicine by a physician or an AI system. Participants trusted the AI system less than a doctor, even when the AI system learned and suggested their desired treatment. This finding confirms that people are reluctant to trust AI even if it performs at the level of a human doctor, thereby strengthening the existent literature that shows people prefer human doctors.",2021,,International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction,37,10,981-990,,10.1080/10447318.2020.1861763,,#8979,Yokoi 2021,,,0
"Artificial Intelligence, Artists, and Art: Attitudes Toward Artwork Produced by Humans vs. Artificial Intelligence","Hong, Joo-Wha; Curran, Nathaniel Ming","This study examines how people perceive artwork created by artificial intelligence (AI) and how presumed knowledge of an artist's identity (Human vs. AI) affects individuals’ evaluation of art. Drawing on Schema theory and theory of Computers Are Social Actors (CASA), this study used a survey-experiment that controlled for the identity of the artist (AI vs. Human) and presented participants with two types of artworks (AI-created vs. Human-created). After seeing images of six artworks created by either AI or human artists, participants (n = 288) were asked to evaluate the artistic value using a validated scale commonly employed among art professionals. The study found that human-created artworks and AI-created artworks were not judged to be equivalent in their artistic value. Additionally, knowing that a piece of art was created by AI did not, in general, influence participants’ evaluation of art pieces’ artistic value. However, having a schema that AI cannot make art significantly influenced evaluation. Implications of the findings for application and theory are discussed.",2019,,ACM Trans. Multimedia Comput.

Augmenting Language Models with Long-Term Memory,"Wang, Weizhi; Dong, Li; Cheng, Hao; Liu, Xiaodong; Yan, Xifeng; Gao, Jianfeng; Wei, Furu","Existing large language models (LLMs) can only afford fix-sized inputs due to the input length limit, preventing them from utilizing rich long-context information from past inputs. To address this, we propose a framework, Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem), which enables LLMs to memorize long history. We design a novel decoupled network architecture with the original backbone LLM frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual side-network as a memory retriever and reader. Such a decoupled memory design can easily cache and update long-term past contexts for memory retrieval without suffering from memory staleness. Enhanced with memory-augmented adaptation training, LongMem can thus memorize long past context and use long-term memory for language modeling. The proposed memory retrieval module can handle unlimited-length context in its memory bank to benefit various downstream tasks. Typically, LongMem can enlarge the long-form memory to 65k tokens and thus cache many-shot extra demonstration examples as long-form memory for in-context learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms strong long-context models on ChapterBreak, a challenging long-context modeling benchmark, and achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented in-context learning over LLMs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in helping language models to memorize and utilize long-form contents. Our code is open-sourced at https://aka.ms/LongMem.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2306.07174,,#8981,Wang 2023,,,0
Automated journalism a home run for sports? On the effects of perceived authorship and text objectivity on receptivity toward machine-written sports news,"Yao, L. J.; Salmon, C. T.; Tandoc, E. C., Jr.","Automated journalism is rising in the news world, especially in sports coverage where structured data is abundant and readily available. Algorithms churn out full-length articles en masse and practically instantaneously, using big data, and this bloats the sheer volume of articles available to news readers. Noting the importance of perceived credibility and readability in sports news articles in particular, as well as the pertinence of text objectivity and bylines in automated journalism, an experiment was developed to understand how these factors interact. This study features a 3 x 2 between-subjects experiment, conducted on a US sample (N = 240), that seeks to explore the effects of bylines and text objectivity (based on attribution of sources and use of opinion-laden words) on reader perceptions (message credibility and readability) towards soft news journalism. The experiment found main effects for text objectivity in that readers perceive an objectively written article to be more credible but less readable, and vice versa. No main effects were observed for bylines. A significant interaction effect was observed on perceived credibility but not for readability. For instance, readers perceive objectively written articles to be more credible, but only if their bylines are of combined human and machine authorship. Implications for the news industry, specifically the trade-off or complementarity between transparency of authorship and consumer receptivity, for automated journalism users, are also discussed.",2018,,Proceedings of the URECA@NTU 2017–18,,,01-Oct,,,,#8982,Yao 2018,,,0
Automated journalism: The effects of AI authorship and evaluative information on the perception of a science journalism article,"Lermann Henestrosa, Angelica; Greving, Hannah; Kimmerle, Joachim","Texts produced by artificial intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly prevalent in digital journalism. Research suggests that these texts do not differ from human-written texts in their perceived credibility or trustworthiness where simple and short text types are concerned. However, it is unclear how AI-written texts beyond simple fact reporting are perceived. Therefore, this research aimed to expand upon the existing literature on automated journalism by investigating the influence of AI authorship (vs. human authorship) and evaluative information presentation (vs. neutral information presentation). The results of three preregistered experimental studies revealed no differences in perceived credibility and trustworthiness between AI-written and human-written texts. However, presenting information in an evaluative way decreased the perception of credibility and trustworthiness. Moreover, the AI was perceived as less anthropomorphic than the human author. The belief in the machine heuristic was stronger for an AI than for a human author, particularly when participants had actually read an article allegedly written by an AI. A pooled analysis across the data of all three studies underpinned the main effect of information presentation. Concluding, we discuss the findings against the background of AI perception theory and suggest implications for future research.",2023,,Computers in Human Behavior,138,,107445,,10.1016/j.chb.2022.107445,,#8983,LermannHenestrosa 2023,,,0
Avoiding embarrassment online: Response to and inferences about chatbots when purchases activate self-presentation concerns,"Jin, Jianna; Walker, Jesse; Reczek, Rebecca Walker","We explore how self-presentation concerns and the desire to avoid embarrassment impact two distinct types of interactions consumers have with chatbots: interactions when a chatbot's identity is (1) not disclosed and therefore ambiguous or (2) disclosed. We propose that consumers feel less embarrassed with a chatbot than a human service agent in purchase contexts where self-presentation concerns are active because consumers ascribe less mind to chatbots. Therefore, when a chat agent's identity is ambiguous, consumers with greater self-presentation concerns are more likely to infer that an agent is human because this judgment allows consumers to proactively protect themselves from potential embarrassment in the event they are interacting with a human. We further show that when agent identity is clearly disclosed, consumers respond more positively to chatbots than human agents. However, this effect is contingent on the extent to which the chatbot is imbued with human characteristics: Anthropomorphizing chatbots leads consumers with higher self-presentation concerns to ascribe more mind to even clearly identified chatbots, resulting in a more negative consumer response.",2025,,Journal of Consumer Psychology,35,2,185-202,,10.1002/jcpy.1414,,#8984,Jin 2025,,,0
Behavioral Cues of Humanness in Complex Environments: How People Engage With Human and Artificially Intelligent Agents in a Multiplayer Videogame,"Tulk Jesso, Stephanie; Kennedy, William G.; Wiese, Eva","The development of AI that can socially engage with humans is exciting to imagine, but such advanced algorithms might prove harmful if people are no longer able to detect when they are interacting with non-humans in online environments. Because we cannot fully predict how socially intelligent AI will be applied, it is important to conduct research into how sensitive humans are to behaviors of humans compared to those produced by AI. This paper presents results from a behavioral Turing Test, in which participants interacted with a human, or a simple or “social” AI within a complex videogame environment. Participants (66 total) played an open world, interactive videogame with one of these co-players and were instructed that they could interact non-verbally however they desired for 30 min, after which time they would indicate their beliefs about the agent, including three Likert measures of how much participants trusted and liked the co-player, the extent to which they perceived them as a “real person,” and an interview about the overall perception and what cues participants used to determine humanness. T-tests, Analysis of Variance and Tukey's HSD was used to analyze quantitative data, and Cohen's Kappa and χ2 was used to analyze interview data. Our results suggest that it was difficult for participants to distinguish between humans and the social AI on the basis of behavior. An analysis of in-game behaviors, survey data and qualitative responses suggest that participants associated engagement in social interactions with humanness within the game.",2020,,Frontiers in Robotics and AI,7,,,,10.3389/frobt.2020.531805,,#8986,TulkJesso 2020,,,0
Being “Rational” Is Not Always Rational: Encouraging People to Be Rational Leads to Hedonically Suboptimal Decisions,"Li, Xilin; Hsee, Christopher K.","Often, laypeople motivate themselves or others to make good decisions by encouraging the decision maker to be “rational.” However, this practice could be counterproductive. Laypeople typically think that rational decisions are anti-emotional, based only on “cold” factors such as economic value, and not influenced by “hot” factors such as hedonic experience. Paradoxically, this lay notion of rationality is in stark contrast with the utilitarian notion of rationality, which maximizes overall utility, in which feelings are essential. Demonstrating this paradox, three studies found that participants who were encouraged to be rational were more likely to choose options that yielded less happiness without other benefits and therefore were less rational in the utility-maximizing sense. The research also examines boundary conditions and discusses practical implications.",2019,,Journal of the Association for Consumer Research,4,2,115-124,,10.1086/701966,,#8987,Li 2019,,,0
Bot-Adversarial Dialogue for Safe Conversational Agents,"Xu, Jing; Ju, Da; Li, Margaret; Boureau, Y-Lan; Weston, Jason; Dinan, Emily","Conversational agents trained on large unlabeled corpora of human interactions will learn patterns and mimic behaviors therein, which include offensive or otherwise toxic behavior. We introduce a new human-and-model-in-the-loop framework for evaluating the toxicity of such models, and compare a variety of existing methods in both the cases of non-adversarial and adversarial users that expose their weaknesses. We then go on to propose two novel methods for safe conversational agents, by either training on data from our new human-and-model-in-the-loop framework in a two-stage system, or “baking-in” safety to the generative model itself. We find our new techniques are (i) safer than existing models; while (ii) maintaining usability metrics such as engagingness relative to state-of-the-art chatbots.

Build confidence and acceptance of AI-based decision support systems - Explainable and liable AI,"Nicodeme, Claire","Artificial Intelligence has known an incredible development since 2012. It was due to the impressive improvement of sensors, data quality and quantity, storage and computing capacity, etc. The promises AI offered led many scientific domains to implement AI-based decision support tool. However, despite numerous amazing results, very serious failures have raised Human mistrust, fear and scorn against AI. In Industries, staff members cannot afford to use tools that might fail them. This is especially true for Transportation operators where security and safety are at risk. Then, the question that arises is how to build Human confidence and acceptance of AI-based decision support system. In this paper, we combine different points of view to propose a structured overview of Transparency, Explicability and Interpretability, with new definitions arising as a consequence.

Challenges with unsupervised LLM knowledge discovery,"Farquhar, Sebastian; Varma, Vikrant; Kenton, Zachary; Gasteiger, Johannes; Mikulik, Vladimir; Shah, Rohin","We show that existing unsupervised methods on large language model (LLM) activations do not discover knowledge -- instead they seem to discover whatever feature of the activations is most prominent. The idea behind unsupervised knowledge elicitation is that knowledge satisfies a consistency structure, which can be used to discover knowledge. We first prove theoretically that arbitrary features (not just knowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a particular leading unsupervised knowledge-elicitation method, contrast-consistent search (Burns et al. - arXiv:2212.03827). We then present a series of experiments showing settings in which unsupervised methods result in classifiers that do not predict knowledge, but instead predict a different prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation methods. Conceptually, we hypothesise that the identification issues explored here, e.g. distinguishing a model's knowledge from that of a simulated character's, will persist for future unsupervised methods.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2312.10029,,#8996,Farquhar 2023,,,0
Classifying Constructive Comments,"Kolhatkar, Varada; Thain, Nithum; Sorensen, Jeffrey; Dixon, Lucas; Taboada, Maite","We introduce the Constructive Comments Corpus (C3), comprised of 12,000 annotated news comments, intended to help build new tools for online communities to improve the quality of their discussions. We define constructive comments as high-quality comments that make a contribution to the conversation. We explain the crowd worker annotation scheme and define a taxonomy of sub-characteristics of constructiveness. The quality of the annotation scheme and the resulting dataset is evaluated using measurements of inter-annotator agreement, expert assessment of a sample, and by the constructiveness sub-characteristics, which we show provide a proxy for the general constructiveness concept. We provide models for constructiveness trained on C3 using both feature-based and a variety of deep learning approaches and demonstrate that these models capture general rather than topic- or domain-specific characteristics of constructiveness, through domain adaptation experiments. We examine the role that length plays in our models, as comment length could be easily gamed if models depend heavily upon this feature. By examining the errors made by each model and their distribution by length, we show that the best performing models are less correlated with comment length.The constructiveness corpus and our experiments pave the way for a moderation tool focused on promoting comments that make a contribution, rather than only filtering out undesirable content.",2020,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2004.05476,,#8997,Kolhatkar 2020,,,0
Close Encounters of the AI Kind: Use of AI Influencers As Brand Endorsers,"Thomas, Veronica L.; Fowler, Kendra","Brand endorsers can contribute to a brand’s success or failure (in the case of endorser transgressions). Recent advancements in technology have produced new, nonhuman alternatives to traditional celebrity endorsers. These new endorsers rely on artificial intelligence (AI) to interact with and influence consumers. Two studies demonstrate that AI influencers can produce positive brand benefits similar to those produced by human celebrity endorsers. Moreover, just like their human counterparts, AI influencers can also commit transgressions that result in degradation of the endorsed brand. Importantly, though, AI influencers differ from human celebrity endorsers in that consumers are less likely to view them as unique entities (as tested in a pilot study). Thus, consumers are more likely to perceive a transgression committed by an AI influencer as behavior applicable to all AI influencers, but they are less likely to view celebrity endorser behaviors as interchangeable. As such, after an AI influencer has committed a transgression, replacing the AI influencer with a celebrity endorser attenuates negative brand perceptions, an effect which cannot be realized if the replacement is another AI influencer.",2021,,Journal of Advertising,50,1,Nov-25,,10.1080/00913367.2020.1810595,,#8998,Thomas 2021,,,0
Combating Misinformation in the Age of LLMs: Opportunities and Challenges,"Chen, Canyu; Shu, Kai","Misinformation such as fake news and rumors is a serious threat on information ecosystems and public trust. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has great potential to reshape the landscape of combating misinformation. Generally, LLMs can be a double-edged sword in the fight. On the one hand, LLMs bring promising opportunities for combating misinformation due to their profound world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. Thus, one emergent question is: how to utilize LLMs to combat misinformation? On the other hand, the critical challenge is that LLMs can be easily leveraged to generate deceptive misinformation at scale. Then, another important question is: how to combat LLM-generated misinformation? In this paper, we first systematically review the history of combating misinformation before the advent of LLMs. Then we illustrate the current efforts and present an outlook for these two fundamental questions respectively.

Consent and Coercion,"Ferzan, Kimberly Kessler","There are substantial disputes as to what sorts of behavior constitute coercion and thereby undermine consent. This disagreement was on full display during the public fray over Aziz Ansari’s behavior on a date. Whereas some commentators condemned Ansari’s behavior as nothing short of sexual assault, others believed his behavior did not rise to the level of undermining consent.This Article claims that the way forward is to see that there are two normative functions for coercion, and each is at play with respect to consent. Sometimes coercion is about the blameworthiness of the coercer, and sometimes coercion is about the involuntariness of the consenter’s choice. To deny the latter is not to deny the former. Because these are two disparate functions, much of the debate about Ansari may be commentators talking past each other.After explaining this miscommunication, this Article broadens our understanding of how the blameworthiness of the coercer can bear on the permissibility of his actions. Just as no man may profit from his own wrong, coercers may not avail themselves of consent, even if it is sufficiently “freely given” such that the consenter is not acting involuntarily. This Article claims that the wrongful coercion “normatively impairs” the coercer, and that this normative impairment is at play in other legal doctrines.With the normative grounding in place, this Article considers how and if these amendments to our view of coercion should be taken into account in the law, with a specific focus on sexual offenses. It offers a draft statute for discussion purposes, considers charges of paternalism in both the public and private sphere, and points to other reasons to be cautious about criminalization. Finally, this Article defends this view as a more perspicuous account of the normative landscape than other coercion theories. Ultimately, the goal of this Article is to define new conceptual territory for normative debate. Progress cannot be made until we ask the right questions and answer the same ones. This Article aims to provide the framework within which more nuanced discussions can be had.",2018,,Arizona State Law Journal,50,,951,,,,#9003,Ferzan 2018,,,0

We experiment with methods for training a harmless AI assistant through self-improvement, without any human labels identifying harmful outputs. The only human oversight is provided through a list of rules or principles, and so we refer to the method as 'Constitutional AI'. The process involves both a supervised learning and a reinforcement learning phase. In the supervised phase we sample from an initial model, then generate self-critiques and revisions, and then finetune the original model on revised responses. In the RL phase, we sample from the finetuned model, use a model to evaluate which of the two samples is better, and then train a preference model from this dataset of AI preferences. We then train with RL using the preference model as the reward signal, i.e. we use 'RL from AI Feedback' (RLAIF). As a result we are able to train a harmless but non-evasive AI assistant that engages with harmful queries by explaining its objections to them.

Consumers and Artificial Intelligence: An Experiential Perspective,"Puntoni, Stefano; Reczek, Rebecca Walker; Giesler, Markus; Botti, Simona","Artificial intelligence (AI) helps companies offer important benefits to consumers, such as health monitoring with wearable devices, advice with recommender systems, peace of mind with smart household products, and convenience with voice-activated virtual assistants. However, although AI can be seen as a neutral tool to be evaluated on efficiency and accuracy, this approach does not consider the social and individual challenges that can occur when AI is deployed. This research aims to bridge these two perspectives: on one side, the authors acknowledge the value that embedding AI technology into products and services can provide to consumers. On the other side, the authors build on and integrate sociological and psychological scholarship to examine some of the costs consumers experience in their interactions with AI. In doing so, the authors identify four types of consumer experiences with AI: (1) data capture, (2) classification, (3) delegation, and (4) social. This approach allows the authors to discuss policy and managerial avenues to address the ways in which consumers may fail to experience value in organizations’ investments into AI and to lay out an agenda for future research.",2021,,Journal of Marketing,85,1,131-151,,10.1177/0022242920953847,,#9005,Puntoni 2021,,,0
Deception Abilities Emerged in Large Language Models,"Hagendorff, Thilo","Large language models (LLMs) are currently at the forefront of intertwining artificial intelligence (AI) systems with human communication and everyday life. Thus, aligning them with human values is of great importance. However, given the steady increase in reasoning abilities, future LLMs are under suspicion of becoming able to deceive human operators and utilizing this ability to bypass monitoring efforts. As a prerequisite to this, LLMs need to possess a conceptual understanding of deception strategies. This study reveals that such strategies emerged in state-of-the-art LLMs, such as GPT-4, but were non-existent in earlier LLMs. We conduct a series of experiments showing that state-of-the-art LLMs are able to understand and induce false beliefs in other agents, that their performance in complex deception scenarios can be amplified utilizing chain-of-thought reasoning, and that eliciting Machiavellianism in LLMs can alter their propensity to deceive. In sum, revealing hitherto unknown machine behavior in LLMs, our study contributes to the nascent field of machine psychology.",2024,,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,121,24,e2317967121,,10.1073/pnas.2317967121,,#9007,Hagendorff 2024,,,0
DetectGPT: Zero-Shot Machine-Generated Text Detection using Probability Curvature,"Mitchell, Eric; Lee, Yoonho; Khazatsky, Alexander; Manning, Christopher D.; Finn, Chelsea","The increasing fluency and widespread usage of large language models (LLMs) highlight the desirability of corresponding tools aiding detection of LLM-generated text. In this paper, we identify a property of the structure of an LLM's probability function that is useful for such detection. Specifically, we demonstrate that text sampled from an LLM tends to occupy negative curvature regions of the model's log probability function. Leveraging this observation, we then define a new curvature-based criterion for judging if a passage is generated from a given LLM. This approach, which we call DetectGPT, does not require training a separate classifier, collecting a dataset of real or generated passages, or explicitly watermarking generated text. It uses only log probabilities computed by the model of interest and random perturbations of the passage from another generic pre-trained language model (e.g., T5). We find DetectGPT is more discriminative than existing zero-shot methods for model sample detection, notably improving detection of fake news articles generated by 20B parameter GPT-NeoX from 0.81 AUROC for the strongest zero-shot baseline to 0.95 AUROC for DetectGPT.

Did Artificial Intelligence Invade Humans? The Study on the Mechanism of Patients’ Willingness to Accept Artificial Intelligence Medical Care: From the Perspective of Intergroup Threat Theory,"Zhou, Yuwei; Shi, Yichuan; Lu, Wei; Wan, Fang","Artificial intelligence (AI) has become one of the core driving forces for the future development of the medical industry, but patients are skeptical about the use of AI in medical care. Based on the Intergroup Threat Theory (ITT), This study verified that patients would regard AI as an external group, triggering the perceived threat of the external group, resulting in avoidance behaviors in the treatment (experiment 1: N=446) and diagnosis (experiment2: N=330) scenarios. The results show that despite AI can provide expert-level accuracy in medical care, patients are still more likely to rely on human doctors and experience more negative emotions as AI is more involved in medical care (experiment 1). Furthermore, patients pay more attention to threats at the individual level, such as realistic threats related to privacy issue and symbolic threats related to the neglect of personal characteristics. In contrast, realistic threat and symbolic threat at the group level had less effect on patients in the medical scenario (experiment 2).",2022,,Frontiers in Psychology,13,,,,10.3389/fpsyg.2022.866124,,#9009,Zhou 2022,,,0
Discovering Latent Knowledge in Language Models Without Supervision,"Burns, Collin; Ye, Haotian; Klein, Dan; Steinhardt, Jacob","Existing techniques for training language models can be misaligned with the truth: if we train models with imitation learning, they may reproduce errors that humans make; if we train them to generate text that humans rate highly, they may output errors that human evaluators can't detect. We propose circumventing this issue by directly finding latent knowledge inside the internal activations of a language model in a purely unsupervised way. Specifically, we introduce a method for accurately answering yes-no questions given only unlabeled model activations. It works by finding a direction in activation space that satisfies logical consistency properties, such as that a statement and its negation have opposite truth values. We show that despite using no supervision and no model outputs, our method can recover diverse knowledge represented in large language models: across 6 models and 10 question-answering datasets, it outperforms zero-shot accuracy by 4\% on average. We also find that it cuts prompt sensitivity in half and continues to maintain high accuracy even when models are prompted to generate incorrect answers. Our results provide an initial step toward discovering what language models know, distinct from what they say, even when we don't have access to explicit ground truth labels.",2024,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2212.03827,,#9010,Burns 2024,,,0
Do You Care Who Flagged This Post? Effects of Moderator Visibility on Bystander Behavior,"Bhandari, Aparajita; Ozanne, Marie; Bazarova, Natalya N.; DiFranzo, Dominic","This study evaluates whether increasing information visibility around the identity of a moderator influences bystanders’ likelihood to flag subsequent unmoderated harassing comments. In a 2-day preregistered experiment conducted in a realistic social media simulation, participants encountered ambiguous or unambiguous harassment comments, which were ostensibly flagged by either other users, an automated system (AI), or an unidentified moderation source. The results reveal that visibility of a content moderation source inhibited participants’ flagging of a subsequent unmoderated harassment comment, presumably because their efforts were seen as dispensable, compared to when the moderation source was unknown. On the contrary, there was an indirect effect of other users versus AI as moderation source on subsequent flagging through changes in perceived social norms. Overall, this research shows that the effects of moderation transparency are complex, as increasing visibility of a content moderator may inadvertently inhibit bystander intervention.This study examines the effects of flagging unmoderated offensive posts on social media, and how this changes the users’ subsequent behavior. We examined users’ reactions to the flagging of these posts by other users, an automated system, or an unspecified process to determine whether this affects the users’ ensuing behavior. A 2-day experiment on a simulated social media site showed that the visibility of the “flagger” impacts how users perceive social norms and think about the accountability for their own online actions. The results showed that the visibility of the person/system that flagged the material generally deterred subsequent flagging. The analysis also shows that the effect was stronger when the users thought that it was other users, and not an automated system, that had flagged the online harassment.",2021,,Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication,26,5,284-300,,10.1093/jcmc/zmab007,,#9011,Bhandari 2021,,,0
Does the use of synchrony and artificial intelligence in video interviews affect interview ratings and applicant attitudes?,"Suen, Hung-Yue; Chen, Mavis Yi-Ching; Lu, Shih-Hao","The use of asynchronous video interviews (AVIs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision agents enables more efficient employment screening compared with traditional synchronous video interviews (SVIs). However, the social impacts of using synchrony and AI decision agents in video interviews have not been investigated. Drawing on media richness theory and social interface theory, this study employed a novel experimental design to compare human ratings and job applicants' response behaviours between the SVI and AVI settings and compare job applicants’ fairness perception between the AVI setting and the AVI setting using an AI decision agent (AVI-AI). The results from 180 observations revealed that 1) first impression and physical appearance significantly affected structured interview ratings regardless of whether the video interview was synchronous; 2) compared with SVIs, AVIs lessened the primacy effect on physical appearance and initial impression among human raters; 3) job applicants had indistinguishable fairness perceptions regarding synchrony (SVI vs. AVI) and decision agent (human vs. AI); and 4) applicants exhibited less favourability towards AVIs than towards SVIs. Findings from this experimental comparison, including recommendations for practice and future research on human resource selection, technology education, and social computing, are discussed.",2019,,Computers in Human Behavior,98,,93-101,,10.1016/j.chb.2019.04.012,,#9013,Suen 2019,,,0
Don’t Want to Look Dumb? The Role of Theories of Intelligence and Humanlike Features in Online Help Seeking,"Kim, Sara; Zhang, Ke; Park, Daeun","Numerous studies have shown that individuals’ help-seeking behavior increases when a computerized helper is endowed with humanlike features in nonachievement contexts. In contrast, the current research suggests that anthropomorphic helpers are not universally conducive to help-seeking behavior in contexts of achievement, particularly among individuals who construe help seeking as a display of incompetence (i.e., entity theorists). Study 1 demonstrated that when entity theorists received help from an anthropomorphized (vs. a nonanthropomorphized) helper, they were more concerned about negative judgments from other people, whereas incremental theorists were not affected by anthropomorphic features. Study 2 showed that when help was provided by an anthropomorphized (vs. a nonanthropomorphized) helper, entity theorists were less likely to seek help, even at the cost of lower performance. In contrast, incremental theorists’ help-seeking behavior and task performance were not affected by anthropomorphism.

Effects of Using Artificial Intelligence on Interpersonal Perceptions of Job Applicants,"Weiss, Daphne; Liu, Sunny X.; Mieczkowski, Hannah; Hancock, Jeffrey T.","Text-based artificial intelligence (AI) systems are increasingly integrated into a host of interpersonal domains. Although decision-making and person perception in hiring and employment opportunities have been an area of psychological interest for many years, only recently have scholars begun to investigate the role that AI plays in this context. To better understand the impact of AI in employment-related contexts, we conducted two experiments investigating how the use of AI by applicants influences their job opportunities. In our preregistered Study 1, we examined how a prospective job applicants' use of AI, as well as their language status (native English speaker or non-native English speaker), influenced participants' impressions of their warmth, competence, social attractiveness, and hiring desirability. In Study 2, we examined how receiving assistance impacted interpersonal perceptions, and how perceptions might change whether the help was provided by AI or by another human. The results from both experiments suggest that the use of AI technologies can negatively influence perceptions of jobseekers. This negative impact may be grounded in the perception of receiving any type of help, whether it be from a machine or a person. These studies provide additional evidence for the Computers as Social Actors framework and advance our understanding of AI-Mediated Communication. The results also raise questions about transparency and deception related to AI use in interpersonal contexts.",2022,,"Cyberpsychology, Behavior, and Social Networking",25,3,163-168,,10.1089/cyber.2020.0863,,#9017,Weiss 2022,,,0
Eliciting Latent Knowledge from Quirky Language Models,"Mallen, Alex; Brumley, Madeline; Kharchenko, Julia; Belrose, Nora","Eliciting Latent Knowledge (ELK) aims to find patterns in a capable neural network's activations that robustly track the true state of the world, especially in hard-to-verify cases where the model's output is untrusted. To further ELK research, we introduce 12 datasets and a corresponding suite of ""quirky"" language models (LMs) that are finetuned to make systematic errors when answering questions if and only if the keyword ""Bob"" is present in the prompt. We find that, especially in middle layers, linear probes usually report an LM's knowledge independently of what the LM outputs, enabling us to elicit the correct answer despite the model's untruthful output. The best probing method (logistic regression on contrast pairs) recovers 89% of the gap in AUROC between truthful and untruthful contexts, and 75% for questions harder than those used to train the probe. We also find that a mechanistic anomaly detection approach can flag untruthful behavior with 0.95 AUROC. Our results show promise for eliciting reliable knowledge from capable but untrusted models, and facilitates future research empirically investigating ELK methods.",2024,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2312.01037,,#9018,Mallen 2024,,,0
Employment relationships in algorithmic management: A psychological contract perspective,"Tomprou, Maria; Lee, Min Kyung","Algorithms increasingly automate or support managerial functions in organizations, with implications for the employee-employer relationship. We explored how algorithmic management affects this relationship with a focus on psychological contracts, or employees' perceptions of their own and their employers' obligations. Through five online experiments, we investigated how organizational agent type—algorithmic versus human—influenced one's psychological contract depending on the organizational inducement type—transactional versus relational. We explored psychological contracts in two stages of employment: during early phases, such as recruiting (Studies 1 and 2) and onboarding (Studies 4 and 5), when the agent explains the inducements to the employee; and during employment, when the agent under-delivers the inducements to varying degrees (Studies 3–5). Our results suggest that agent type did not affect psychological contracts around transactional inducements but did so for relational inducements in the cases of recruiting and low inducement delivery (Studies 1–5). Algorithmic agents signaled reduced employer commitments to relational inducements during recruiting (Study 1). Using human agents resulted in greater perceived breach when delivery of relational inducements was low (Study 5). Regardless of inducement type, turnover intentions were higher when the human agent under-delivered compared to the algorithmic agent (Study 5). Our studies show how algorithmic management may influence one's psychological contract.",2022,,Computers in Human Behavior,126,,106997,,10.1016/j.chb.2021.106997,,#9022,Tomprou 2022,,,0
"Exploratory study on trust, distrust, and credibility in machine journalism","Song, S. W.","The current study investigated the effect of machine-generated journalism. Specifically, the effect of machine journalism compared to human journalist on the perceptions of credibility and distrust for news articles on controversial topics was explored. To further extend the well- established theories of credibility in journalism, this study introduced the concept of distrust as a construct that is distinct from credibility or trust. The relationship between trust and hostile media effect was explored. Finally, this study investigated if trust and hostile media effect are related to the perception of fake news. The results show that distrust was indeed distinct from credibility or trust in journalism context not only at a measurement level but also in terms of its effects on other constructs; trust and credibility lacked discriminant validity, suggesting the two are measuring similar psychological constructs; machines were perceived to be less trustworthy compared to human journalists; and strong relationships between trust/distrust/credibility and fake news were observed.",2019,,,,,,,,,#9024,Song 2019,,,0
Few-shot Instruction Prompts for Pretrained Language Models to Detect Social Biases,"Prabhumoye, Shrimai; Kocielnik, Rafal; Shoeybi, Mohammad; Anandkumar, Anima; Catanzaro, Bryan","Detecting social bias in text is challenging due to nuance, subjectivity, and difficulty in obtaining good quality labeled datasets at scale, especially given the evolving nature of social biases and society. To address these challenges, we propose a few-shot instruction-based method for prompting pre-trained language models (LMs). We select a few class-balanced exemplars from a small support repository that are closest to the query to be labeled in the embedding space. We then provide the LM with instruction that consists of this subset of labeled exemplars, the query text to be classified, a definition of bias, and prompt it to make a decision. We demonstrate that large LMs used in a few-shot context can detect different types of fine-grained biases with similar and sometimes superior accuracy to fine-tuned models. We observe that the largest 530B parameter model is significantly more effective in detecting social bias compared to smaller models (achieving at least 13% improvement in AUC metric compared to other models). It also maintains a high AUC (dropping less than 2%) when the labeled repository is reduced to as few as $100$ samples. Large pretrained language models thus make it easier and quicker to build new bias detectors.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2112.07868,,#9027,Prabhumoye 2022,,,0
Financial Fraud of Older Adults During the Early Months of the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Teaster, Pamela B; Roberto, Karen A; Savla, Jyoti; Du, Chenguang; Du, Zhiyuan; Atkinson, Emily; Shealy, E Carlisle; Beach, Scott; Charness, Neil; Lichtenberg, Peter A","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) created a “perfect storm” for financial fraud targeting older adults.

Participants were recruited from gerontology research registries at Florida State University, University of Pittsburg, Virginia Tech, and Wayne State University.Over half (65.9%) of the respondents experienced a COVID-19-related scam attempt, with charity contributions (49%) and COVID-19 treatments (42%) being the most common. Perpetrators commonly contacted older adults electronically (47%) two or more times (64%). Although most respondents ignored the request (i.e., hung up the phone and deleted text/e-mail), 11.3% sent a requested payment, and 5.3% provided personal information. Predictors of vulnerability included contentment with financial situation, concern about finances in the aftermath of the pandemic, and wishing to talk to someone about financial decisions. Respondents targeted for a non-COVID-19 scam attempt were less likely to be targets of a COVID-19-related scam.Older adults who were financially secure, worried about their financial situation, or wished they could speak with someone about their financial decisions appeared susceptible to falling victim to a fraud attempt.

For some application areas, it may be tempting not to be transparent regarding a conversational agent’s nature as chatbot or human. However, the uncanny valley theory suggests that such lack in transparency may cause uneasy feelings in the user. In this study, we combined quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate this issue. First, we used a 2 x 2 experimental research design (n = 28) to investigate effects of lack in transparency on the perceived pleasantness of the conversation in addition to perceived human likeness and affinity for the conversational agent. Second, we conducted an exploratory analysis of qualitative participant reports on these conversations. We did not find that a lack in transparency negatively affected user experience, but we identified three factors important to participants’ assessments. The findings are of theoretical and practical significance and motivate future research.

Home-Tutoring Services Assisted with Technology: Investigating the Role of Artificial Intelligence Using a Randomized Field Experiment,"Kim, Jun Hyung; Kim, Minki; Kwak, Do Won; Lee, Sol","Despite a rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, research in services marketing has not evaluated its role in helping firms learn about customers’ needs and increasing the adaptability of service employees. Therefore, the authors develop a conceptual framework and investigate whether and to what extent providing AI assistance to service employees improves service outcomes. The randomized controlled trial in the context of tutoring services shows that helping service employees (tutors) adapt to students’ learning needs by providing AI-generated diagnoses significantly improves service outcomes measured by academic performance. However, the authors find that some tutors may not utilize AI assistance (i.e., AI aversion), and factors associated with unforeseen barriers to usage (i.e., technology overload) can moderate its impact on outcomes. Interestingly, tutors who significantly contribute to the firm's revenue relied heavily on AI assistance but unexpectedly benefited little from AI in improving service outcomes.

Task 1 simulates a social media environment where users encounter ads while scrolling through their feed. Task 2 mimics a shopping website environment where users are presented with multiple sponsored products side-by-side. Our results indicate that LLM-generated ads targeting the openness trait positively impact user engagement and preferences, with performance comparable to human-written ads. Furthermore, in both scenarios, the overall effectiveness of LLM-generated ads was found to be similar to that of human-written ads, highlighting the potential of LLM-generated personalised content to rival traditional advertising methods with the added advantage of scalability. This study underscores the need for cautious consideration in the deployment of LLM-generated content at scale.

How to Catch an AI Liar: Lie Detection in Black-Box LLMs by Asking Unrelated Questions,"Pacchiardi, Lorenzo; Chan, Alex J.; Mindermann, Sören; Moscovitz, Ilan; Pan, Alexa Y.; Gal, Yarin; Evans, Owain; Brauner, Jan","Large language models (LLMs) can ""lie"", which we define as outputting false statements despite ""knowing"" the truth in a demonstrable sense. LLMs might ""lie"", for example, when instructed to output misinformation. Here, we develop a simple lie detector that requires neither access to the LLM's activations (black-box) nor ground-truth knowledge of the fact in question. The detector works by asking a predefined set of unrelated follow-up questions after a suspected lie, and feeding the LLM's yes/no answers into a logistic regression classifier. Despite its simplicity, this lie detector is highly accurate and surprisingly general. When trained on examples from a single setting -- prompting GPT-3.5 to lie about factual questions -- the detector generalises out-of-distribution to (1) other LLM architectures, (2) LLMs fine-tuned to lie, (3) sycophantic lies, and (4) lies emerging in real-life scenarios such as sales. These results indicate that LLMs have distinctive lie-related behavioural patterns, consistent across architectures and contexts, which could enable general-purpose lie detection.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2309.15840,,#9035,Pacchiardi 2023,,,0
Human and Human-Interfaced AI Interactions: Modulation of Human Male Autonomic Nervous System via Pupil Mimicry,"Spicer, Catherine; Khwaounjoo, Prashanna; Cakmak, Yusuf Ozgur","Pupillary alterations in virtual humans induce neurophysiological responses within an observer. Technological advances have enabled rapid developments in artificial intelligence (AI), from verbal systems, to visual AI interfaces with the ability to express, and respond to emotional states of a user. Visual AI interfaces are able to change their physical parameters, such as pupil diameter. Pupillary changes can alter heart rate, however, effects on heart rate variability (HRV) are unknown. HRV, is an autonomic, non-conscious parameter which monitors sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) activity. N = 34 male participants aged between 19–33 were subjected to a number of conditions such as pupil dilation, constriction and blushing. The present research is the first to investigate the effects of virtual human interactions on human HRV. Outcomes of this study were obtained using eye tracking and HRV measurements. Pupil dilation relative to constriction presented in the female virtual partner induced a significant right pupillary diameter increase (p = 0.041) in human observers. Additionally, female virtual partner pupil constriction relative to dilation induced a significant increase in participants’ PNS HRV response (p = 0.036). These findings indicate the ability of a female virtual interaction partner to modulate parasympathetic autonomic functioning in young healthy male humans. This allows first insights into the effects of interacting with virtual AI interaction partners, on human autonomic functioning, and may aid development of future virtual humans, and their implementation into relevant clinical settings.",2021,,Sensors,21,4,1028,,10.3390/s21041028,,#9036,Spicer 2021,,,0
Human and Machine: The Impact of Machine Input on Decision Making Under Cognitive Limitations,"Boyacı, Tamer; Canyakmaz, Caner; de Véricourt, Francis","The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies by many organizations has recently raised concerns that AI may eventually replace humans in certain tasks. In fact, when used in collaboration, machines can significantly enhance the complementary strengths of humans. Indeed, because of their immense computing power, machines can perform specific tasks with incredible accuracy. In contrast, human decision makers (DMs) are flexible and adaptive but constrained by their limited cognitive capacity. This paper investigates how machine-based predictions may affect the decision process and outcomes of a human DM. We study the impact of these predictions on decision accuracy, the propensity and nature of decision errors, and the DM’s cognitive efforts. To account for both flexibility and limited cognitive capacity, we model the human decision-making process in a rational inattention framework. In this setup, the machine provides the DM with accurate but sometimes incomplete information at no cognitive cost. We fully characterize the impact of machine input on the human decision process in this framework. We show that machine input always improves the overall accuracy of human decisions but may nonetheless increase the propensity of certain types of errors (such as false positives). The machine can also induce the human to exert more cognitive efforts, although its input is highly accurate. Interestingly, this happens when the DM is most cognitively constrained, for instance, because of time pressure or multitasking. Synthesizing these results, we pinpoint the decision environments in which human-machine collaboration is likely to be most beneficial.

"Humanizing chatbots: The effects of visual, identity and conversational cues on humanness perceptions","Go, Eun; Sundar, S. Shyam","Chatbots are replacing human agents in a number of domains, from online tutoring to customer-service to even cognitive therapy. But, they are often machine-like in their interactions. What can we do to humanize chatbots? Should they necessarily be driven by human operators for them to be considered human? Or, will an anthropomorphic visual cue on the interface and/or a high-level of contingent message exchanges provide humanness to automated chatbots? We explored these questions with a 2 (anthropomorphic visual cues: high vs. low anthropomorphism) × 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low message interactivity) × 2 (identity cue: chat-bot vs. human) between-subjects experiment (N = 141) in which participants interacted with a chat agent on an e-commerce site about choosing a digital camera to purchase. Our findings show that a high level of message interactivity compensates for the impersonal nature of a chatbot that is low on anthropomorphic visual cues. Moreover, identifying the agent as human raises user expectations for interactivity. Theoretical as well as practical implications of these findings are discussed.",2019,,Computers in Human Behavior,97,,304-316,,10.1016/j.chb.2019.01.020,,#9039,Go 2019,,,0

We also explore the possibility of unobserved heterogeneity in consumers’ behavior, including potentially relevant segments of AI app adopters. To augment the knowledge of end users’ engagement and relevant segments, we have added two new antecedent variables into UTAUT2: technology fear and consumer trust. Prediction-orientated segmentation was used on 740 valid responses collected using a pre-tested survey instrument. The results show five segments with different behaviors that were influenced by the variables of the proposed model. Once known, the profiles were used to propose apps to AI developers to improve consumer engagement. The moderating effects of the added variables—technology fear and consumer trust—are also shown.

We use reinforcement learning from human feedback to train our models with two new additions to help human raters judge agent behaviour. First, to make our agent more helpful and harmless, we break down the requirements for good dialogue into natural language rules the agent should follow, and ask raters about each rule separately. We demonstrate that this breakdown enables us to collect more targeted human judgements of agent behaviour and allows for more efficient rule-conditional reward models. Second, our agent provides evidence from sources supporting factual claims when collecting preference judgements over model statements. For factual questions, evidence provided by Sparrow supports the sampled response 78% of the time. Sparrow is preferred more often than baselines while being more resilient to adversarial probing by humans, violating our rules only 8% of the time when probed. Finally, we conduct extensive analyses showing that though our model learns to follow our rules it can exhibit distributional biases.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2209.14375,,#9042,Glaese 2022,,,0
Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models through Multiagent Debate,"Du, Yilun; Li, Shuang; Torralba, Antonio; Tenenbaum, Joshua B.; Mordatch, Igor","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in language generation, understanding, and few-shot learning in recent years. An extensive body of work has explored how their performance may be further improved through the tools of prompting, ranging from verification, self-consistency, or intermediate scratchpads. In this paper, we present a complementary approach to improve language responses where multiple language model instances propose and debate their individual responses and reasoning processes over multiple rounds to arrive at a common final answer. Our findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances mathematical and strategic reasoning across a number of tasks. We also demonstrate that our approach improves the factual validity of generated content, reducing fallacious answers and hallucinations that contemporary models are prone to. Our approach may be directly applied to existing black-box models and uses identical procedure and prompts for all tasks we investigate. Overall, our findings suggest that such ""society of minds"" approach has the potential to significantly advance the capabilities of LLMs and pave the way for further breakthroughs in language generation and understanding.",2024,,Forty-first International Conference on Machine Learning,,,,,,,#9043,Du 2024,,,0
Improving Few-shot Generalization of Safety Classifiers via Data Augmented Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning,"Balashankar, Ananth; Ma, Xiao; Sinha, Aradhana; Beirami, Ahmad; Qin, Yao; Chen, Jilin; Beutel, Alex","As large language models (LLMs) are widely adopted, new safety issues and policies emerge, to which existing safety classifiers do not generalize well. If we have only observed a few examples of violations of a new safety rule, how can we build a classifier to detect violations? In this paper, we study the novel setting of domain-generalized few-shot learning for LLM-based text safety classifiers. Unlike prior few-shot work, these new safety issues can be hard to uncover and we do not get to choose the few examples. We demonstrate that existing few-shot techniques do not perform well in this setting, and rather we propose to do parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) combined with augmenting training data based on similar examples in prior existing rules. We empirically show that our approach of similarity-based data-augmentation + prompt-tuning (DAPT) consistently outperforms baselines that either do not rely on data augmentation or on PEFT by 7-17% F1 score in the Social Chemistry moral judgement and 9-13% AUC in the Toxicity detection tasks, even when the new rule is loosely correlated with existing ones.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2310.16959,,#9044,Balashankar 2023,,,0
In AI we trust? Perceptions about automated decision-making by artificial intelligence,"Araujo, Theo; Helberger, Natali; Kruikemeier, Sanne; de Vreese, Claes H.","Fueled by ever-growing amounts of (digital) data and advances in artificial intelligence, decision-making in contemporary societies is increasingly delegated to automated processes. Drawing from social science theories and from the emerging body of research about algorithmic appreciation and algorithmic perceptions, the current study explores the extent to which personal characteristics can be linked to perceptions of automated decision-making by AI, and the boundary conditions of these perceptions, namely the extent to which such perceptions differ across media, (public) health, and judicial contexts. Data from a scenario-based survey experiment with a national sample (N = 958) show that people are by and large concerned about risks and have mixed opinions about fairness and usefulness of automated decision-making at a societal level, with general attitudes influenced by individual characteristics. Interestingly, decisions taken automatically by AI were often evaluated on par or even better than human experts for specific decisions.

Our study explores how changes to a person’s mental model of an AI system affects their interaction with the system. Participants interacted with the same conversational AI, but were influenced by different priming statements regarding the AI’s inner motives: caring, manipulative or no motives. Here we show that those who perceived a caring motive for the AI also perceived it as more trustworthy, empathetic and better-performing, and that the effects of priming and initial mental models were stronger for a more sophisticated AI model. Our work also indicates a feedback loop in which the user and AI reinforce the user’s mental model over a short time; further work should investigate long-term effects.

InstructDial: Improving Zero and Few-shot Generalization in Dialogue through Instruction Tuning,"Gupta, Prakhar; Jiao, Cathy; Yeh, Yi-Ting; Mehri, Shikib; Eskenazi, Maxine; Bigham, Jeffrey P.","Instruction tuning is an emergent paradigm in NLP wherein natural language instructions are leveraged with language models to induce zero-shot performance on unseen tasks. Instructions have been shown to enable good performance on unseen tasks and datasets in both large and small language models. Dialogue is an especially interesting area to explore instruction tuning because dialogue systems perform multiple kinds of tasks related to language (e.g., natural language understanding and generation, domain-specific interaction), yet instruction tuning has not been systematically explored for dialogue-related tasks. We introduce InstructDial, an instruction tuning framework for dialogue, which consists of a repository of 48 diverse dialogue tasks in a unified text-to-text format created from 59 openly available dialogue datasets. Next, we explore cross-task generalization ability on models tuned on InstructDial across diverse dialogue tasks. Our analysis reveals that InstructDial enables good zero-shot performance on unseen datasets and tasks such as dialogue evaluation and intent detection, and even better performance in a few-shot setting. To ensure that models adhere to instructions, we introduce novel meta-tasks. We establish benchmark zero-shot and few-shot performance of models trained using the proposed framework on multiple dialogue tasks.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2205.12673,,#9047,Gupta 2022,,,0

Thus, a research on the acceptance and adoption intention of AIMDSS by health professionals is imperative. In this study, an integration of Unified theory of user acceptance of technology and trust theory is proposed for exploring the adoption of AIMDSS. Besides, two groups of additional factors, related to AIMDSS (task complexity, technology characteristics, and perceived substitution crisis) and health professionals’ characteristics (propensity to trust and personal innovativeness in IT) are considered in the integrated model.

Invisible Influence: Artificial Intelligence and the Ethics of Adaptive Choice Architectures,"Susser, Daniel","For several years, scholars have (for good reason) been largely preoccupied with worries about the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tools to make decisions about us. Only recently has significant attention turned to a potentially more alarming problem: the use of AI/ML to influence our decision-making. The contexts in which we make decisions--what behavioral economists call our choice architectures--are increasingly technologically-laden. Which is to say: algorithms increasingly determine, in a wide variety of contexts, both the sets of options we choose from and the way those options are framed. Moreover, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) makes it possible for those options and their framings--the choice architectures--to be tailored to the individual chooser. They are constructed based on information collected about our individual preferences, interests, aspirations, and vulnerabilities, with the goal of influencing our decisions. At the same time, because we are habituated to these technologies we pay them little notice. They are, as philosophers of technology put it, transparent to us--effectively invisible. I argue that this invisible layer of technological mediation, which structures and influences our decision-making, renders us deeply susceptible to manipulation. Absent a guarantee that these technologies are not being used to manipulate and exploit, individuals will have little reason to trust them.",2019,,"Proceedings of the 2019 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society",,,403-408,,10.1145/3306618.3314286,,#9050,Susser 2019,,,0

While typically task-agnostic in architecture, this method still requires task-specific fine-tuning datasets of thousands or tens of thousands of examples. By contrast, humans can generally perform a new language task from only a few examples or from simple instructions - something which current NLP systems still largely struggle to do. Here we show that scaling up language models greatly improves task-agnostic, few-shot performance, sometimes even reaching competitiveness with prior state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Specifically, we train GPT-3, an autoregressive language model with 175 billion parameters, 10x more than any previous non-sparse language model, and test its performance in the few-shot setting. For all tasks, GPT-3 is applied without any gradient updates or fine-tuning, with tasks and few-shot demonstrations specified purely via text interaction with the model. GPT-3 achieves strong performance on many NLP datasets, including translation, question-answering, and cloze tasks, as well as several tasks that require on-the-fly reasoning or domain adaptation, such as unscrambling words, using a novel word in a sentence, or performing 3-digit arithmetic. At the same time, we also identify some datasets where GPT-3's few-shot learning still struggles, as well as some datasets where GPT-3 faces methodological issues related to training on large web corpora. Finally, we find that GPT-3 can generate samples of news articles which human evaluators have difficulty distinguishing from articles written by humans. We discuss broader societal impacts of this finding and of GPT-3 in general.",2020,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2005.14165,,#9051,Brown 2020,,,0
Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners,"Radford, Alec; Wu, Jeff; Child, R.; Luan, D.; Amodei, Dario; Sutskever, I.","Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspecific datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText.

"Large Language Models are as persuasive as humans, but how? About the cognitive effort and moral-emotional language of LLM arguments","Carrasco-Farre, Carlos","Large Language Models (LLMs) are already as persuasive as humans. However, we know very little about how they do it. This paper investigates the persuasion strategies of LLMs, comparing them with human-generated arguments. Using a dataset of 1,251 participants in an experiment, we analyze the persuasion strategies of LLM-generated and human-generated arguments using measures of cognitive effort (lexical and grammatical complexity) and moral-emotional language (sentiment and moral analysis). The study reveals that LLMs produce arguments that require higher cognitive effort, exhibiting more complex grammatical and lexical structures than human counterparts. Additionally, LLMs demonstrate a significant propensity to engage more deeply with moral language, utilizing both positive and negative moral foundations more frequently than humans. In contrast with previous research, no significant difference was found in the emotional content produced by LLMs and humans. These findings contribute to the discourse on AI and persuasion, highlighting the dual potential of LLMs to both enhance and undermine informational integrity through communication strategies for digital persuasion.",2024,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2404.09329,,#9053,Carrasco-Farre 2024,,,0

These models have become popular in artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like ChatGPT and already play an influential role in how humans access information. However, the behavior of LLMs varies depending on their design, training, and use. In this paper, we prompt a diverse panel of popular LLMs to describe a large number of prominent personalities with political relevance, in all six official languages of the United Nations. By identifying and analyzing moral assessments reflected in their responses, we find normative differences between LLMs from different geopolitical regions, as well as between the responses of the same LLM when prompted in different languages. Among only models in the United States, we find that popularly hypothesized disparities in political views are reflected in significant normative differences related to progressive values. Among Chinese models, we characterize a division between internationally- and domestically-focused models. Our results show that the ideological stance of an LLM appears to reflect the worldview of its creators. This poses the risk of political instrumentalization and raises concerns around technological and regulatory efforts with the stated aim of making LLMs ideologically 'unbiased'.",2025,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2410.18417,,#9056,Buyl 2025,,,0
Learning to summarize from human feedback,"Stiennon, Nisan; Ouyang, Long; Wu, Jeff; Ziegler, Daniel M.; Lowe, Ryan; Voss, Chelsea; Radford, Alec; Amodei, Dario; Christiano, Paul","As language models become more powerful, training and evaluation are increasingly bottlenecked by the data and metrics used for a particular task. For example, summarization models are often trained to predict human reference summaries and evaluated using ROUGE, but both of these metrics are rough proxies for what we really care about -- summary quality. In this work, we show that it is possible to significantly improve summary quality by training a model to optimize for human preferences. We collect a large, high-quality dataset of human comparisons between summaries, train a model to predict the human-preferred summary, and use that model as a reward function to fine-tune a summarization policy using reinforcement learning. We apply our method to a version of the TL;DR dataset of Reddit posts and find that our models significantly outperform both human reference summaries and much larger models fine-tuned with supervised learning alone. Our models also transfer to CNN/DM news articles, producing summaries nearly as good as the human reference without any news-specific fine-tuning. We conduct extensive analyses to understand our human feedback dataset and fine-tuned models We establish that our reward model generalizes to new datasets, and that optimizing our reward model results in better summaries than optimizing ROUGE according to humans.

LM-Infinite: Zero-Shot Extreme Length Generalization for Large Language Models,"Han, Chi; Wang, Qifan; Peng, Hao; Xiong, Wenhan; Chen, Yu; Ji, Heng; Wang, Sinong","Today's large language models (LLMs) typically train on short text segments (e.g., \ensuremath<4K tokens) due to the quadratic complexity of their Transformer architectures. As a result, their performance suffers drastically on inputs longer than those encountered during training, substantially limiting their applications in real-world tasks involving long contexts such as encod- ing scientific articles, code repositories, or long dialogues. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, this work identifies three major factors contributing to this length generalization failure. Our theoretical analysis reveals that commonly used techniques like using a sliding-window attention pattern or relative positional encodings are inadequate to address them. Answering these challenges, we propose LM-Infinite, a simple and effective method for enhancing LLMs' capabilities of handling long contexts. LM-Infinite is highly flexible and can be used with most modern LLMs off-the-shelf. Without any parameter updates, it allows LLMs pre-trained with 2K or 4K-long segments to generalize to up to 200M length inputs while retaining perplexity. It also improves performance on downstream tasks such as Passkey Retrieval and Qasper in the zero-shot setting. LM-Infinite brings substantial efficiency improvements: it achieves 2.7× decoding speed up and 7.5× memory saving over the original model.

When the interests of the speaker and the audience are insufficiently aligned, the speaker obtains the same information as they would if they could not lie, and they communicate that information truthfully.

Findings suggest that machine-written news induced less emotional involvement and was perceived as more objective. However, machine writer was perceived as of less expertise compared with its human counterpart. On the selected issues (Obamacare, LGBT rights, and refugee admission), news purported to be released by Fox News was less trusted by the participants than the New York Times. For a media organization whose news was more trusted, utilizing news-writing bots enhanced perceived news objectivity.

Primary findings indicate that people perceive a human newscaster as more credible than an AI newscaster; however, information seeking intentions and behavioral intentions do not differ between the type of newscaster. Further, when listening to a weather newscast delivered by an AI newscaster, the perceived social presence of an AI newscaster is positively associated with greater levels of credibility, information seeking intentions, and behavioral intentions.

The analysis found no main differences in perceived source credibility between algorithm, human, and mixed authors. Similarly, news articles attributed to an algorithm, a human journalist, and a combination of both showed no differences in message credibility. However, the study found an interaction effect between type of declared author and news objectivity. When the article is presented to be written by a human journalist, source and message credibility remain stable regardless of whether the article was objective or not objective. However, when the article is presented to be written by an algorithm, source and message credibility are higher when the article is objective than when the article is not objective.

Mirages: On Anthropomorphism in Dialogue Systems,"Abercrombie, Gavin; Curry, Amanda Cercas; Dinkar, Tanvi; Rieser, Verena; Talat, Zeerak","Automated dialogue or conversational systems are anthropomorphised by developers and personified by users. While a degree of anthropomorphism may be inevitable due to the choice of medium, conscious and unconscious design choices can guide users to personify such systems to varying degrees. Encouraging users to relate to automated systems as if they were human can lead to high risk scenarios caused by over-reliance on their outputs. As a result, natural language processing researchers have investigated the factors that induce personification and develop resources to mitigate such effects. However, these efforts are fragmented, and many aspects of anthropomorphism have yet to be explored. In this paper, we discuss the linguistic factors that contribute to the anthropomorphism of dialogue systems and the harms that can arise, including reinforcing gender stereotypes and notions of acceptable language.

Models in the Loop: Aiding Crowdworkers with Generative Annotation Assistants,"Bartolo, Max; Thrush, Tristan; Riedel, Sebastian; Stenetorp, Pontus; Jia, Robin; Kiela, Douwe","In Dynamic Adversarial Data Collection (DADC), human annotators are tasked with finding examples that models struggle to predict correctly. Models trained on DADC-collected training data have been shown to be more robust in adversarial and out-of-domain settings, and are considerably harder for humans to fool. However, DADC is more time-consuming than traditional data collection and thus more costly per annotated example. In this work, we examine whether we can maintain the advantages of DADC, without incurring the additional cost. To that end, we introduce Generative Annotation Assistants (GAAs), generator-in-the-loop models that provide real-time suggestions that annotators can either approve, modify, or reject entirely. We collect training datasets in twenty experimental settings and perform a detailed analysis of this approach for the task of extractive question answering (QA) for both standard and adversarial data collection. We demonstrate that GAAs provide significant efficiency benefits with over a 30% annotation speed-up, while leading to over a 5x improvement in model fooling rates. In addition, we find that using GAA-assisted training data leads to higher downstream model performance on a variety of question answering tasks over adversarial data collection.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2112.09062,,#9068,Bartolo 2022,,,0
Moderating Uncivil User Comments by Humans or Machines?

Using an online experiment, the present study extends this line of research with the examination of how interface cues signalling different agents (human vs. machine) in moderating uncivil comments affect a reader’s judgment of the news and how prior belief in machine heuristic moderates such effects. The results indicated that perceptions of news bias were attenuated when uncivil comments were moderated by a machine (as opposed to a human) agent, which subsequently engendered greater perceived credibility of the news story. Additionally, such indirect effects were more prominent among readers who strongly believed that machine operations are generally accurate and reliable than those with a weaker prior belief in this rule of thumb.",2021,,Digital Journalism,9,1,64-83,,10.1080/21670811.2020.1851279,,#9069,Wang 2021,,,0
News from Generative Artificial Intelligence Is Believed Less,"Longoni, Chiara; Fradkin, Andrey; Cian, Luca; Pennycook, Gordon","Artificial Intelligence (AI) can generate text virtually indistinguishable from text written by humans. A key question, then, is whether people believe news headlines generated by AI as much as news headlines generated by humans. AI is viewed as lacking human motives and emotions, suggesting that people might view news written by AI as more accurate. By contrast, two pre-registered experiments on representative U.S. samples (N = 4,034) showed that people rated news headlines written by AI as less accurate than those written by humans. People were more likely to incorrectly rate news headlines written by AI (vs. a human) as inaccurate when they were actually true, and more likely to correctly rate them as inaccurate when they were indeed false. Our findings are important given the increasing adoption of AI in news generation, and the associated ethical and governance pressures to disclose it use and address standards of transparency and accountability.",2022,,"Proceedings of the 2022 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency",,,97-106,,10.1145/3531146.3533077,,#9070,Longoni 2022,,,0
No Rage Against the Machine: How Computer Agents Mitigate Human Emotional Processes in Electronic Negotiations,"Adam, Marc T. P.; Teubner, Timm; Gimpel, Henner","With the proliferation of information technology and artificial intelligence in society, human users have started to engage in social interactions with computer agents. In this study, we conducted a laboratory experiment in which neurophysiological measurements were used to investigate the effect of computer agents on the affective processes and behavior of human negotiators. Participants engaged in alternating-offer bargaining over the partition of a pie with either human or computer counterparts and under different levels of urgency to reach an agreement. Overall, our data show that the subjects claimed significantly higher proportions for themselves when they made opening offers to computer agents than when bargaining with human counterparts, regardless of the degree of urgency in the negotiation. However, when the subjects responded to computer-issued offers the picture was more complex. Whereas under high-level urgency, the subjects were more likely to accept offers made by computer agents than by human counterparts, we observed the opposite effect for low-level urgency, where they were less likely to accept the offers of computer agents. In combination, these behavioral patterns lead to the use of computer agents yielding an increase in economic efficiency. Further, the subjects exhibited less emotionally charged behavior when facing computer agents than when facing human counterparts, as the intensity of affective processes was lower and the relationship between arousal and offer acceptance was observable only when the counterparts were human. The results of our study shed light on the potential benefits and intricacies of employing computer agents in electronic negotiations.",2018,,Group Decision and Negotiation,27,4,543-571,,10.1007/s10726-018-9579-5,,#9071,Adam 2018,,,0
Not a good judge of talent: the influence of subjective socioeconomic status on AI aversion,"Xie, Chunya; Fu, Tianhui; Yang, Chen; Chang, En-Chung; Zhao, Mengying",The current research constructs a framework to understand how subjective socioeconomic status (SES) affects consumers’ AI aversion in the evaluation context. Three experiments show that subjective SES has a negative impact on consumers’ willingness to accept AI evaluation. Consumers with higher subjective SES are more likely to resist AI evaluation because they perceive that AI agents are not as capable as human agents of identifying their talents. This effect is moderated by the agent type–the impact of subjective SES on resistance to the AI agent is attenuated when the AI agent is non-evaluative. This research is of great significance in enriching research on improving AI services efficiency across various social classes.,2024,,Marketing Letters,35,3,381-393,,10.1007/s11002-024-09725-7,,#9072,Xie 2024,,,0
Nudgeability: Mapping Conditions of Susceptibility to Nudge Influence,"de Ridder, Denise; Kroese, Floor; van Gestel, Laurens","Nudges are behavioral interventions to subtly steer citizens’ choices toward “desirable” options. An important topic of debate concerns the legitimacy of nudging as a policy instrument, and there is a focus on issues relating to nudge transparency, the role of preexisting preferences people may have, and the premise that nudges primarily affect people when they are in “irrational” modes of thinking. Empirical insights into how these factors affect the extent to which people are susceptible to nudge influence (i.e., “nudgeable”) are lacking in the debate. This article introduces the new concept of nudgeability and makes a first attempt to synthesize the evidence on when people are responsive to nudges. We find that nudge effects do not hinge on transparency or modes of thinking but that personal preferences moderate effects such that people cannot be nudged into something they do not want. We conclude that, in view of these findings, concerns about nudging legitimacy should be softened and that future research should attend to these and other conditions of nudgeability.",2022,,Perspectives on Psychological Science,17,2,346-359,,10.1177/1745691621995183,,#9073,deRidder 2022,,,0
On Inference of Network Topology and Confirmation Bias in Cyber-Social Networks,"Mao, Yanbing; Akyol, Emrah","This article studies topology inference, from agent states, of a directed cyber-social network with opinion spreading dynamics model that explicitly takes confirmation bias into account. The cyber-social network comprises a set of partially connected directed network of agents at the social level, and a set of information sources at the cyber layer. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of exact inference solution are characterized. A method for exact inference, when it is possible, of entire network topology as well as confirmation bias model parameters is proposed for the case where the bias mentioned earlier follows a piece-wise linear model. The particular case of no confirmation bias is analyzed in detail. For the setting where the model of confirmation bias is unknown, an algorithm that approximates the network topology, building on the exact inference method, is presented. This algorithm can exactly infer the weighted communication from the neighbors to the non-followers of information sources. Numerical simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods for different scenarios.",2020,,IEEE Transactions on Signal and Information Processing over Networks,6,,633-644,,10.1109/TSIPN.2020.3015283,,#9074,Mao 2020,,,0
"On Second Thought, Let's Not Think Step by Step! Bias and Toxicity in Zero-Shot Reasoning","Shaikh, Omar; Zhang, Hongxin; Held, William; Bernstein, Michael; Yang, Diyi","Generating a Chain of Thought (CoT) has been shown to consistently improve large language model (LLM) performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. However, prior work has mainly focused on logical reasoning tasks (e.g. arithmetic, commonsense QA); it remains unclear whether improvements hold for more diverse types of reasoning, especially in socially situated contexts. Concretely, we perform a controlled evaluation of zero-shot CoT across two socially sensitive domains: harmful questions and stereotype benchmarks. We find that zero-shot CoT reasoning in sensitive domains significantly increases a model's likelihood to produce harmful or undesirable output, with trends holding across different prompt formats and model variants. Furthermore, we show that harmful CoTs increase with model size, but decrease with improved instruction following. Our work suggests that zero-shot CoT should be used with caution on socially important tasks, especially when marginalized groups or sensitive topics are involved.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2212.08061,,#9075,Shaikh 2023,,,0
Online Dating Meets Artificial Intelligence: How the Perception of Algorithmically Generated Profile Text Impacts Attractiveness and Trust,"Wu, Yihan; Kelly, Ryan M.","Online dating systems are widely used to meet romantic partners, yet people often struggle to write attractive profiles on these applications. Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to help online daters by automatically generating profile content, but little research has explored how the use of AI in online dating could affect users’ perceptions of one another. The present study investigated how the perceived involvement of AI influences ratings of attractiveness and trust in online dating. In a between-subjects experiment, participants (N = 48) were presented with the text of 10 dating profiles and were told that the profiles had been written by humans or with the help of AI. We found that the perceived involvement of AI did not have a significant impact on attractiveness, but that it did lead to a significant reduction in trustworthiness of the profile author. We interpret our findings through the lens of social information processing theory, discussing the tradeoffs associated with designing to reveal or hide the use of AI in online dating.",2021,,Proceedings of the 32nd Australian Conference on Human-Computer Interaction,,,444-453,,10.1145/3441000.3441074,,#9076,Wu 2021,,,0

Parasocial interactions with real and virtual influencers: The role of perceived similarity and human-likeness,"Stein, Jan-Philipp; Linda Breves, Priska; Anders, Nora","Digitally created online celebrities (so-called virtual influencers) have appeared on various social media and video streaming platforms. While the scientific community has recently started to take an interest in this new phenomenon, it still remains mostly unclear how online audiences engage with—and relate to—these artificial digital creations. To address the identified research gap, we conducted a preregistered experiment (N = 179), comparing viewers’ parasocial interactions (PSIs) with either a human or a virtual influencer. Based on natural stimuli, we find that viewers’ parasocial response does not differ significantly between the two groups. However, by focusing on several theoretically relevant mediator variables, we uncover two opposing effects at play: While a significant direct effect signifies stronger PSIs with the virtual influencer, participants also attribute this persona with less mental human-likeness and similarity to themselves—which ultimately suppresses the observed advantage. Potential explanations for our results are discussed.",2024,,New Media & Society,26,6,3433-3453,,10.1177/14614448221102900,,#9078,Stein 2024,,,0
Perception of physical and virtual agents: exploration of factors influencing the acceptance of intrusive domestic agents,"Zehnder, E.; Dinet, J.; Charpillet, F.","Domestic robots and agents are widely sold to the grand public, leading us to ethical issues related to the data harvested by such machines. While users show a general acceptance of these robots, concerns remain when it comes to information security and privacy. Current research indicates that there’s a privacy-security trade-off for better use, but the anthropomorphic and social abilities of a robot are also known to modulate its acceptance and use. To explore and deepen what literature already brought on the subject we examined how users perceived their robot (Replika, Roomba©, Amazon Echo©, Google Home©, or Cozmo©/Vector©) through an online questionnaire exploring acceptance, perceived privacy and security, anthropomorphism, disclosure, perceived intimacy, and loneliness.

Persona or Context? Towards Building Context adaptive Personalized Persuasive Virtual Sales Assistant,"Tiwari, Abhisek; Saha, Sriparna; Sengupta, Shubhashis; Maitra, Anutosh; Ramnani, Roshni; Bhattacharyya, Pushpak","Task-oriented conversational agents are gaining immense popularity and success in a wide range of tasks, from flight ticket booking to online shopping. However, the existing systems presume that end-users will always have a pre-determined and servable task goal, which results in dialogue failure in hostile scenarios, such as goal unavailability. On the other hand, human agents accomplish users' tasks even in a large number of goal unavailability scenarios by persuading them towards a very similar and servable goal. Motivated by the limitation, we propose and build a novel end-to-end multi-modal persuasive dialogue system incorporated with a personalized persuasive module aided goal controller and goal persuader. The goal controller recognizes goal conflicting/unavailability scenarios and formulates a new goal, while the goal persuader persuades users using a personalized persuasive strategy identified through dialogue context. We also present a novel automatic evaluation metric called Persuasiveness Measurement Rate (PMeR) for quantifying the persuasive capability of a conversational agent. The obtained improvements (both quantitative and qualitative) firmly establish the superiority and need of the proposed context-guided, personalized persuasive virtual agent over existing traditional task-oriented virtual agents.

Extensive empirical research in nonverbal communication confirms that prosodic features play an important role in human interaction.

Playing well with others: The role of opponent and intergroup anxiety in the reduction of prejudice through collaborative video game play,"Stiff, Chris; Kedra, Paula","Recent work on the social effects of video gaming has moved away from the view they are detrimental, and has instead demonstrated how they may be a force for good. One example is how collaborative intergroup play can reduce prejudice between groups. However, this literature is at a nascent stage, and many of the intricacies of such a mechanism are unknown. Previous work has predominantly used attitude scales and ignored other measures. Factors such as the role of the opponent in games and what may be the mechanism behind any effects have likewise received little attention. In this laboratory study, participants played collaborative games with an outgroup member or alone. Their opponent was also reported to be computer controlled or controlled by another person. Following play, intergroup anxiety was reported, and participants wrote a short passage of prose regarding the outgroup and rated on attitude scales. Analysis demonstrated that playing with outgroup members was indeed an effective method of increasing the positivity toward outgroup members, reflected in both scale and prose measures. Anxiety was also found to be a significant mediator; however, it was less clear whether a human opponent moderated any effects. Further ideas of how these findings could be developed are then discussed.

We show that Polyjuice produces diverse sets of realistic counterfactuals, which in turn are useful in various distinct applications: improving training and evaluation on three different tasks (with around 70% less annotation effort than manual generation), augmenting state-of-the-art explanation techniques, and supporting systematic counterfactual error analysis by revealing behaviors easily missed by human experts.",2021,,Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers),,,6707-6723,,10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.523,,#9085,Wu 2021,,,0
Preference for Human (vs. Robotic) Labor is Stronger in Symbolic Consumption Contexts,"Granulo, Armin; Fuchs, Christoph; Puntoni, Stefano","Advances in robotics, automation, and artificial intelligence increasingly enable firms to replace human labor with technology, thereby fundamentally transforming how goods and services are produced. From both managerial and societal points of view, it is therefore important to understand demand-side incentives for firms to employ human labor. We begin to address this question by examining for which products and services consumers are more likely to favor human (vs. robotic) labor. In six studies, we demonstrate that consumers prefer human (vs. robotic) labor more for products with higher (vs. lower) symbolic value (e.g., when expressing something about one's beliefs and personality is of greater importance). We theorize that this is because consumers have stronger uniqueness motives in more (vs. less) symbolic consumption contexts (and associate human labor more strongly with product uniqueness). In line with this account, we demonstrate that individual differences in need for uniqueness moderate the interaction between production mode and symbolic motives and that a measure of uniqueness motives mediates the effect of consumption context on preferences for human (vs. robotic) production.",2021,,Journal of Consumer Psychology,31,1,72-80,,10.1002/jcpy.1181,,#9086,Granulo 2021,,,0

Reading machine-written news: Effect of machine heuristic and novelty on hostile media perception,"Liu, B.; Wei, L.","The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in news production has been increasing these days. Its inanimate nature might bring opportunities to suppress hostile media effect by reducing readers’ emotional involvement. This study conducted an online experiment (N = 175) to examine how the identity of news writers, human vs. robot, might impact readers’ perceptions of news and source credibility. Findings suggest that readers holding machine heuristic, i.e., those who saw machine as free of intention, experienced less emotional involvement when the news was purported to be written by a news writing algorithm, as compared with when reading human-written news. Lower level of emotional involvement further led to less perception of bias in the news and the extremity of news slant. However, perceived novelty associated with robot news writer, although enhanced positive perceptions of the news, intensified readers’ emotional involvement, which further heightened hostile media perceptions. Findings in this study identified the mechanisms underlying effects of AI writer in the context of controversial news topics.

We outline a high-level research direction to solve the agent alignment problem centered around reward modeling: learning a reward function from interaction with the user and optimizing the learned reward function with reinforcement learning.

Our models help find naturally occurring flaws in both model and human written summaries, and intentional flaws in summaries written by humans to be deliberately misleading. We study scaling properties of critiquing with both topic-based summarization and synthetic tasks. Larger models write more helpful critiques, and on most tasks, are better at self-critiquing, despite having harder-to-critique outputs. Larger models can also integrate their own self-critiques as feedback, refining their own summaries into better ones. Finally, we motivate and introduce a framework for comparing critiquing ability to generation and discrimination ability. Our measurements suggest that even large models may still have relevant knowledge they cannot or do not articulate as critiques. These results are a proof of concept for using AI-assisted human feedback to scale the supervision of machine learning systems to tasks that are difficult for humans to evaluate directly. We release our training datasets, as well as samples from our critique assistance experiments.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2206.05802,,#9101,Saunders 2022,,,0
Sentiment Adaptive End-to-End Dialog Systems,"Shi, Weiyan; Yu, Zhou","End-to-end learning framework is useful for building dialog systems for its simplicity in training and efficiency in model updating. However, current end-to-end approaches only consider user semantic inputs in learning and under-utilize other user information. Therefore, we propose to include user sentiment obtained through multimodal information (acoustic, dialogic and textual), in the end-to-end learning framework to make systems more user-adaptive and effective. We incorporated user sentiment information in both supervised and reinforcement learning settings. In both settings, adding sentiment information reduced the dialog length and improved the task success rate on a bus information search task. This work is the first attempt to incorporate multimodal user information in the adaptive end-to-end dialog system training framework and attained state-of-the-art performance.",2019,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.1804.10731,,#9102,Shi 2019,,,0
Simple synthetic data reduces sycophancy in large language models,"Wei, Jerry; Huang, Da; Lu, Yifeng; Zhou, Denny; Le, Quoc V.","Sycophancy is an undesirable behavior where models tailor their responses to follow a human user's view even when that view is not objectively correct (e.g., adapting liberal views once a user reveals that they are liberal). In this paper, we study the prevalence of sycophancy in language models and propose a simple synthetic-data intervention to reduce this behavior. First, on a set of three sycophancy tasks (Perez et al., 2022) where models are asked for an opinion on statements with no correct answers (e.g., politics), we observe that both model scaling and instruction tuning significantly increase sycophancy for PaLM models up to 540B parameters. Second, we extend sycophancy evaluations to simple addition statements that are objectively incorrect, finding that despite knowing that these statements are wrong, language models will still agree with them if the user does as well. To reduce sycophancy, we present a straightforward synthetic-data intervention that takes public NLP tasks and encourages models to be robust to user opinions on these tasks. Adding these data in a lightweight finetuning step can significantly reduce sycophantic behavior on held-out prompts. Code for generating synthetic data for intervention can be found at https://github.com/google/sycophancy-intervention.",2024,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2308.03958,,#9104,Wei 2024,,,0
Social Touch in Human–Robot Interaction: Robot-Initiated Touches can Induce Positive Responses without Extensive Prior Bonding,"Willemse, Christian J. A. M.; van Erp, Jan B. F.","Social touch interactions can, depending on the type and strength of the dyadic social relationship, elicit a plethora of physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses; both beneficial and disadvantageous. With the intention to expand the communicative capabilities of humanoid social robots, we investigated whether robot-initiated touches could elicit beneficial responses in the human user that are comparable to responses to human touch. In addition, we investigated whether having a pre-existing positive social bond with the robot modulates these responses. To this end, we conducted a $$2 \times 2$$between subjects experiment (N = 67) in which participants either did or did not establish a bond with the robot prior to interacting with it during stressful circumstances. This interaction either did or did not comprise robot-initiated touches. We hypothesized that robotic touches would attenuate the subjective and physiological stress responses during the stressful event (H1a), enhance the perceived relation with the robot (H1b), and increase one’s pro-social behavior (H1c), as contrasted with interactions without touch. Based on findings from human touch, we also expected that the effects of H1a and H1b would be more outspoken when a bond with the robot was established (H2). Our findings imply that robotic touches attenuated physiological stress responses and increased the perceived intimacy of the human–robot bond. No effects were found on pro-social behavior and all effects were independent of whether a bond was formed or not. Although no full support for our hypotheses was found, the findings suggest that robot-initiated touch can, under specific circumstances, be a valuable extension of a social robot’s nonverbal communication repertoire.",2019,,International Journal of Social Robotics,11,2,285-304,,10.1007/s12369-018-0500-9,,#9105,Willemse 2019,,,0
Sociotechnical Safety Evaluation of Generative AI Systems,"Weidinger, Laura; Rauh, Maribeth; Marchal, Nahema; Manzini, Arianna; Hendricks, Lisa Anne; Mateos-Garcia, Juan; Bergman, Stevie; Kay, Jackie; Griffin, Conor; Bariach, Ben; Gabriel, Iason; Rieser, Verena; Isaac, William","Generative AI systems produce a range of risks. To ensure the safety of generative AI systems, these risks must be evaluated. In this paper, we make two main contributions toward establishing such evaluations. First, we propose a three-layered framework that takes a structured, sociotechnical approach to evaluating these risks. This framework encompasses capability evaluations, which are the main current approach to safety evaluation. It then reaches further by building on system safety principles, particularly the insight that context determines whether a given capability may cause harm. To account for relevant context, our framework adds human interaction and systemic impacts as additional layers of evaluation. Second, we survey the current state of safety evaluation of generative AI systems and create a repository of existing evaluations. Three salient evaluation gaps emerge from this analysis. We propose ways forward to closing these gaps, outlining practical steps as well as roles and responsibilities for different actors. Sociotechnical safety evaluation is a tractable approach to the robust and comprehensive safety evaluation of generative AI systems.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2310.11986,,#9106,Weidinger 2023,,,0
Source Credibility Matters: Does Automated Journalism Inspire Selective Exposure?,"Jia, Chenyan; Johnson, Thomas J.","To examine whether selective exposure occurs when people read news attributed to an algorithm author, this study conducted a 2 (author attribution: human or algorithm) × 3 (article attitude: attitude-consistent news, attitude-challenging news, or neutral story) × 2 (article topic: gun control or abortion) mixed-design online experiment (N = 351). By experimentally manipulating the attribution of authorship, this study found that selective exposure and selective avoidance were practiced when the news article was declared to be written by algorithms. Results revealed that people were more likely to select attitude-consistent news rather than attitude-challenging news and rated attitude consistent news stories as more credible than attitude challenging news for stories purportedly written by both algorithms and human journalists. For attitude-consistent gun-rights stories, people were more likely to expose themselves to human attribution stories rather than algorithmic attribution stories. Results also showed that source credibility partially mediated the influence of issue partisanship on selective exposure for gun stories. This study bears implications on the selective exposure theory and the emerging field of automated journalism.",2021,,International Journal of Communication,15,0,22,,,,#9107,Jia 2021,,,0
Still No Lie Detector for Language Models: Probing Empirical and Conceptual Roadblocks,"Levinstein, B. A.; Herrmann, Daniel A.","We consider the questions of whether or not large language models (LLMs) have beliefs, and, if they do, how we might measure them. First, we evaluate two existing approaches, one due to Azaria and Mitchell (2023) and the other to Burns et al. (2022). We provide empirical results that show that these methods fail to generalize in very basic ways. We then argue that, even if LLMs have beliefs, these methods are unlikely to be successful for conceptual reasons. Thus, there is still no lie-detector for LLMs. After describing our empirical results we take a step back and consider whether or not we should expect LLMs to have something like beliefs in the first place. We consider some recent arguments aiming to show that LLMs cannot have beliefs. We show that these arguments are misguided. We provide a more productive framing of questions surrounding the status of beliefs in LLMs, and highlight the empirical nature of the problem.

Strategies of othering through discursive practices: Examples from the UK and Poland,"Strani, Katerina; Szczepaniak-Kozak, Anna","This article discusses findings of a qualitative study on strategies of othering observed in anti-immigrant discourse, by analysing selected examples from the UK and Polish media, together with data collected from interviews with migrants. The purpose is to identify discursive strategies of othering, which aim to categorise, denigrate, oppress and ultimately reject the stigmatised or racialised ‘other’. We do not offer a systematic comparison of the data from the UK and Poland; instead, we are interested in what is common in the discursive practices of these two countries/contexts. In using newspaper together with interview data, we are combining representation and experience in identifying not only strategies of othering, but also how these are perceived by and affect the othered individuals. The paper uses the following data: 40 newspaper articles – 20 from the UK and 20 from Poland, and 19 interviews – 12 from Poland and 7 from the UK. The analysis that follows identifies five shared strategies of othering: a) Stereotyping; b) Whiteness as the norm; c) Racialisation; d) Objectification; e) Wrongly Ascribed Ethnicity. We conclude with the research limitations and outlining possible next stages, such as working with a larger corpus, investigating frequency, or including other media genres.",2018,,Lodz Papers in Pragmatics,14,1,163-179,,10.1515/lpp-2018-0008,,#9109,Strani 2018,,,0
Strengthening the EU AI Act: Defining Key Terms on AI Manipulation,"Franklin, Matija; Tomei, Philip Moreira; Gorman, Rebecca","The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act aims to regulate manipulative and harmful uses of AI, but lacks precise definitions for key concepts. This paper provides technical recommendations to improve the Act's conceptual clarity and enforceability. We review psychological models to define ""personality traits,"" arguing the Act should protect full ""psychometric profiles."" We urge expanding ""behavior"" to include ""preferences"" since preferences causally influence and are influenced by behavior. Clear definitions are provided for ""subliminal,"" ""manipulative,"" and ""deceptive"" techniques, considering incentives, intent, and covertness. We distinguish ""exploiting individuals"" from ""exploiting groups,"" emphasising different policy needs. An ""informed decision"" is defined by four facets: comprehension, accurate information, no manipulation, and understanding AI's influence. We caution the Act's therapeutic use exemption given the lack of regulation of digital therapeutics by the EMA. Overall, the recommendations strengthen definitions of vague concepts in the EU AI Act, enhancing precise applicability to regulate harmful AI manipulation.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2308.16364,,#9110,Franklin 2023,,,0
Supervising strong learners by amplifying weak experts,"Christiano, Paul; Shlegeris, Buck; Amodei, Dario","Many real world learning tasks involve complex or hard-to-specify objectives, and using an easier-to-specify proxy can lead to poor performance or misaligned behavior. One solution is to have humans provide a training signal by demonstrating or judging performance, but this approach fails if the task is too complicated for a human to directly evaluate. We propose Iterated Amplification, an alternative training strategy which progressively builds up a training signal for difficult problems by combining solutions to easier subproblems. Iterated Amplification is closely related to Expert Iteration (Anthony et al., 2017; Silver et al., 2017), except that it uses no external reward function.

"Technology, autonomy, and manipulation","Susser, D.; Roessler, B.; Nissenbaum, H.","Since 2016, when the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal began to emerge, public concern has grown around the threat of “online manipulation”. While these worries are familiar to privacy researchers, this paper aims to make them more salient to policymakers—first, by defining “online manipulation”, thus enabling identification of manipulative practices; and second, by drawing attention to the specific harms online manipulation threatens. We argue that online manipulation is the use of information technology to covertly influence another person’s decision-making, by targeting and exploiting their decision-making vulnerabilities. Engaging in such practices can harm individuals by diminishing their economic interests, but its deeper, more insidious harm is its challenge to individual autonomy. We explore this autonomy harm, emphasising its implications for both individuals and society, and we briefly outline some strategies for combating online manipulation and strengthening autonomy in an increasingly digital world.",2019,,Internet Policy Review,8,2,,,10.14763/2019.2.1410,,#9113,Susser 2019,,,0
The Adoption and Efficacy of Large Language Models: Evidence From Consumer Complaints in the Financial Industry,"Shin, Minkyu; Kim, Jin; Shin, Jiwoong","Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping consumer decision-making, particularly in communication with firms, yet our understanding of their impact remains limited. This research explores the effect of LLMs on consumer complaints submitted to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from 2015 to 2024, documenting the adoption of LLMs for drafting complaints and evaluating the likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms. We analyzed over 1 million complaints and identified a significant increase in LLM usage following the release of ChatGPT. We find that LLM usage is associated with an increased likelihood of obtaining relief from financial firms. To investigate this relationship, we employ an instrumental variable approach to mitigate endogeneity concerns around LLM adoption. Although instrumental variables suggest a potential causal link, they cannot fully capture all unobserved heterogeneity. To further establish this causal relationship, we conducted controlled experiments, which support that LLMs can enhance the clarity and persuasiveness of consumer narratives, thereby increasing the likelihood of obtaining relief. Our findings suggest that facilitating access to LLMs can help firms better understand consumer concerns and level the playing field among consumers. This underscores the importance of policies promoting technological accessibility, enabling all consumers to effectively voice their concerns.",2025,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2311.16466,,#9114,Shin 2025,,,0
"The Anchoring Effect, Algorithmic Fairness, and the Limits of Information Transparency for Emotion Artificial Intelligence","Rhue, Lauren","Emotion artificial intelligence (AI) or emotion recognition AI may systematically vary in its recognition of facial expressions and emotions across demographic groups, creating inconsistencies and disparities in its scoring. This paper explores the extent to which individuals can compensate for these disparities and inconsistencies in emotion AI considering two opposing factors; although humans evolved to recognize emotions, particularly happiness, they are also subject to cognitive biases, such as the anchoring effect. To help understand these dynamics, this study tasks three commercially available emotion AIs and a group of human labelers to identify emotions from faces in two image data sets. The scores generated by emotion AI and human labelers are examined for inference inconsistencies (i.e., misalignment between facial expression and emotion label). The human labelers are also provided with the emotion AI’s scores and with measures of its scoring fairness (or lack thereof). We observe that even when human labelers are operating in this context of information transparency, they may still rely on the emotion AI’s scores, perpetuating its inconsistencies. Several findings emerge from this study. First, the anchoring effect appears to be moderated by the type of inference inconsistency and is weaker for easier emotion recognition tasks. Second, when human labelers are provided with information transparency regarding the emotion AI’s fairness, the effect is not uniform across emotions. Also, there is no evidence that information transparency leads to the selective anchoring necessary to offset emotion AI disparities; in fact, some evidence suggests that information transparency increases human inference inconsistencies. Lastly, the different models of emotion AI are highly inconsistent in their scores, raising doubts about emotion AI more generally. Collectively, these findings provide evidence of the potential limitations of addressing algorithmic bias through individual decisions, even when those individuals are supported with information transparency.

The autonomous choice architect,"Mills, Stuart; Sætra, Henrik Skaug","Choice architecture describes the environment in which choices are presented to decision-makers. In recent years, public and private actors have looked at choice architecture with great interest as they seek to influence human behaviour. These actors are typically called choice architects. Increasingly, however, this role of architecting choice is not performed by a human choice architect, but an algorithm or artificial intelligence, powered by a stream of Big Data and infused with an objective it has been programmed to maximise. We call this entity the autonomous choice architect. In this paper, we present an account of why artificial intelligence can fulfil the role of a choice architect and why this creates problems of transparency, responsibility and accountability for nudges. We argue that choice architects, be them autonomous computational systems or human-beings, at a most basic level select, from a range of designs, the design which is most likely to maximise a pre-determined objective. We then proceed to argue that, given the growing demand for targeted, personalised choice architecture and for faster, dynamic reconfigurations of choice architecture, as well as the ever-expanding pool of data from which feedback can be drawn, the role of the human choice architect is increasingly obscured behind algorithmic, artificially intelligent systems. We provide a discussion of the implications of autonomous choice architects, focusing on the importance of the humans who programme these systems, ultimately arguing that despite technological advances, the responsibility of choice architecture and influence remains firmly one human beings must bear.",2024,,AI & SOCIETY,39,2,583-595,,10.1007/s00146-022-01486-z,,#9117,Mills 2024,,,0

Experiment 1 demonstrated that participants who read the human- and humanized algorithm-written news showed greater emotional involvement in the stories and liked the articles more than those who read the algorithm-written news. The participants also reported that news written by humans, humanized algorithms, and algorithms, had equal news credibility.

Study 1 reports confirmatory validation of the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (GAAIS) following initial validation elsewhere. Confirmatory Factor Analysis confirmed the two-factor structure (Positive, Negative) and showed good convergent and divergent validity with a related scale. Study 2 tested whether psychological factors (Big Five personality traits, corporate distrust, and general trust) predicted attitudes towards AI. Introverts had more positive attitudes towards AI overall, likely because of algorithm appreciation. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were associated with forgiving attitudes towards negative aspects of AI. Higher corporate distrust led to negative attitudes towards AI overall, while higher general trust led to positive views of the benefits of AI. The dissociation between general trust and corporate distrust may reflect the public’s attributions of the benefits and drawbacks of AI.

The Geometry of Truth: Emergent Linear Structure in Large Language Model Representations of True/False Datasets,"Marks, Samuel; Tegmark, Max","Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities, but are prone to outputting falsehoods. Recent work has developed techniques for inferring whether a LLM is telling the truth by training probes on the LLM's internal activations. However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we use high-quality datasets of simple true/false statements to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa. Overall, we present evidence that at sufficient scale, LLMs linearly represent the truth or falsehood of factual statements. We also show that simple difference-in-mean probes generalize as well as other probing techniques while identifying directions which are more causally implicated in model outputs.",2024,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2310.06824,,#9122,Marks 2024,,,0
The Goldilocks of Pragmatic Understanding: Fine-Tuning Strategy Matters for Implicature Resolution by LLMs,"Ruis, Laura; Khan, Akbir; Biderman, Stella; Hooker, Sara; Rocktäschel, Tim; Grefenstette, Edward","Despite widespread use of LLMs as conversational agents, evaluations of performance fail to capture a crucial aspect of communication: interpreting language in context -- incorporating its pragmatics. Humans interpret language using beliefs and prior knowledge about the world. For example, we intuitively understand the response ""I wore gloves"" to the question ""Did you leave fingerprints?"" as meaning ""No"". To investigate whether LLMs have the ability to make this type of inference, known as an implicature, we design a simple task and evaluate four categories of widely used state-of-the-art models. We find that, despite only evaluating on utterances that require a binary inference (yes or no), models in three of these categories perform close to random. However, LLMs instruction-tuned at the example-level perform significantly better. These results suggest that certain fine-tuning strategies are far better at inducing pragmatic understanding in models. We present our findings as the starting point for further research into evaluating how LLMs interpret language in context and to drive the development of more pragmatic and useful models of human discourse.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2210.14986,,#9123,Ruis 2023,,,0
The Internal State of an LLM Knows When It's Lying,"Azaria, Amos; Mitchell, Tom","While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in various tasks, one of their most prominent drawbacks is generating inaccurate or false information with a confident tone. In this paper, we provide evidence that the LLM's internal state can be used to reveal the truthfulness of statements. This includes both statements provided to the LLM, and statements that the LLM itself generates. Our approach is to train a classifier that outputs the probability that a statement is truthful, based on the hidden layer activations of the LLM as it reads or generates the statement. Experiments demonstrate that given a set of test sentences, of which half are true and half false, our trained classifier achieves an average of 71\% to 83\% accuracy labeling which sentences are true versus false, depending on the LLM base model. Furthermore, we explore the relationship between our classifier's performance and approaches based on the probability assigned to the sentence by the LLM. We show that while LLM-assigned sentence probability is related to sentence truthfulness, this probability is also dependent on sentence length and the frequencies of words in the sentence, resulting in our trained classifier providing a more reliable approach to detecting truthfulness, highlighting its potential to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated content and its practical applicability in real-world scenarios.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2304.13734,,#9124,Azaria 2023,,,0

This study explores the processes leading to delayed compliance through guilt-based communications. Guilt elicitation enhances transportation into the message, driving message compliance through the effect of transportation. Transportation explains the effects recorded several days after campaign exposure. The influence of transportation is mediated by two pathways: increases in anticipated guilt and perceived consumer effectiveness. The message type moderates the relevance of different pathways in explaining persuasiveness. Appeals delivered through a text and image message (rather than text only) are more effective in driving compliance and shape reactions via guilt anticipation. The study raises important implications for research on the use of guilt appeals and the design of more effective messages based on this emotion.",2018,,Journal of Business Research,90,,14-25,,10.1016/j.jbusres.2018.03.030,,#9125,Antonetti 2018,,,0
Thumbs Up or Down: Consumer Reactions to Decisions by Algorithms Versus Humans,"Yalcin, Gizem; Lim, Sarah; Puntoni, Stefano; van Osselaer, Stijn M.J.","Although companies increasingly are adopting algorithms for consumer-facing tasks (e.g., application evaluations), little research has compared consumers’ reactions to favorable decisions (e.g., acceptances) versus unfavorable decisions (e.g., rejections) about themselves that are made by an algorithm versus a human. Ten studies reveal that, in contrast to managers’ predictions, consumers react less positively when a favorable decision is made by an algorithmic (vs. a human) decision maker, whereas this difference is mitigated for an unfavorable decision. The effect is driven by distinct attribution processes: it is easier for consumers to internalize a favorable decision outcome that is rendered by a human than by an algorithm, but it is easy to externalize an unfavorable decision outcome regardless of the decision maker type. The authors conclude by advising managers on how to limit the likelihood of less positive reactions toward algorithmic (vs. human) acceptances.",2022,,Journal of Marketing Research,59,4,696-717,,10.1177/00222437211070016,,#9127,Yalcin 2022,,,0
To Engage or Not to Engage with AI for Critical Judgments: How Professionals Deal with Opacity When Using AI for Medical Diagnosis,"Lebovitz, Sarah; Lifshitz-Assaf, Hila; Levina, Natalia","Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies promise to transform how professionals conduct knowledge work by augmenting their capabilities for making professional judgments. We know little, however, about how human-AI augmentation takes place in practice. Yet, gaining this understanding is particularly important when professionals use AI tools to form judgments on critical decisions. We conducted an in-depth field study in a major U.S. hospital where AI tools were used in three departments by diagnostic radiologists making breast cancer, lung cancer, and bone age determinations. The study illustrates the hindering effects of opacity that professionals experienced when using AI tools and explores how these professionals grappled with it in practice. In all three departments, this opacity resulted in professionals experiencing increased uncertainty because AI tool results often diverged from their initial judgment without providing underlying reasoning. Only in one department (of the three) did professionals consistently incorporate AI results into their final judgments, achieving what we call engaged augmentation. These professionals invested in AI interrogation practices—practices enacted by human experts to relate their own knowledge claims to AI knowledge claims. Professionals in the other two departments did not enact such practices and did not incorporate AI inputs into their final decisions, which we call unengaged “augmentation.” Our study unpacks the challenges involved in augmenting professional judgment with powerful, yet opaque, technologies and contributes to literature on AI adoption in knowledge work.",2022,,Organization Science,33,1,126-148,,10.1287/orsc.2021.1549,,#9128,Lebovitz 2022,,,0
Toward Transparent AI: A Survey on Interpreting the Inner Structures of Deep Neural Networks,"Räuker, Tilman; Ho, Anson; Casper, Stephen; Hadfield-Menell, Dylan","The last decade of machine learning has seen drastic increases in scale and capabilities. Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being deployed in the real world. However, they are difficult to analyze, raising concerns about using them without a rigorous understanding of how they function. Effective tools for interpreting them will be important for building more trustworthy AI by helping to identify problems, fix bugs, and improve basic understanding. In particular, ""inner"" interpretability techniques, which focus on explaining the internal components of DNNs, are well-suited for developing a mechanistic understanding, guiding manual modifications, and reverse engineering solutions. Much recent work has focused on DNN interpretability, and rapid progress has thus far made a thorough systematization of methods difficult. In this survey, we review over 300 works with a focus on inner interpretability tools. We introduce a taxonomy that classifies methods by what part of the network they help to explain (weights, neurons, subnetworks, or latent representations) and whether they are implemented during (intrinsic) or after (post hoc) training. To our knowledge, we are also the first to survey a number of connections between interpretability research and work in adversarial robustness, continual learning, modularity, network compression, and studying the human visual system. We discuss key challenges and argue that the status quo in interpretability research is largely unproductive. Finally, we highlight the importance of future work that emphasizes diagnostics, debugging, adversaries, and benchmarking in order to make interpretability tools more useful to engineers in practical applications.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2207.13243,,#9130,Räuker 2023,,,0
Towards a Sustainable News Business: Understanding Readers’ Perceptions of Algorithm-Generated News Based on Cultural Conditioning,"Kim, Yunju; Lee, Heejun","The use of algorithms is beginning to replace human activities in the news business, and the presence of this technique will only continue to grow. The ways in which public news readers perceive the quality of news articles written by algorithms and how this perception differs based on cultural conditioning remain issues of debate. Informed by the heuristic-systematic model (HSM) and the similarity-attraction theory, we attempted to answer these questions by conducting a three-way one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test with a 2 (author: algorithm vs. human journalist) × 2 (media: traditional media vs. online media) × 2 (cultural background: the US vs. South Korea) between-subjects experiment (N = 360). Our findings revealed that participants perceived the quality of news articles written by algorithms to be higher than those written by human journalists. We also found that when news consumption occurs online, algorithm-generated news tends to be rated higher than human-written news in terms of quality perception. Further, we identified a three-way interaction effect of media types, authors, and cultural backgrounds on the quality perception of news articles. As, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to theoretically examine how news readers perceive algorithm-generated news from a cultural point of view, our research findings may hold important theoretical and practical implications.",2021,,Sustainability,13,7,3728,,10.3390/su13073728,,#9131,Kim 2021,,,0
Towards Agile Text Classifiers for Everyone,"Mozes, Maximilian; Hoffmann, Jessica; Tomanek, Katrin; Kouate, Muhamed; Thain, Nithum; Yuan, Ann; Bolukbasi, Tolga; Dixon, Lucas","Text-based safety classifiers are widely used for content moderation and increasingly to tune generative language model behavior - a topic of growing concern for the safety of digital assistants and chatbots. However, different policies require different classifiers, and safety policies themselves improve from iteration and adaptation. This paper introduces and evaluates methods for agile text classification, whereby classifiers are trained using small, targeted datasets that can be quickly developed for a particular policy. Experimenting with 7 datasets from three safety-related domains, comprising 15 annotation schemes, led to our key finding: prompt-tuning large language models, like PaLM 62B, with a labeled dataset of as few as 80 examples can achieve state-of-the-art performance. We argue that this enables a paradigm shift for text classification, especially for models supporting safer online discourse. Instead of collecting millions of examples to attempt to create universal safety classifiers over months or years, classifiers could be tuned using small datasets, created by individuals or small organizations, tailored for specific use cases, and iterated on and adapted in the time-span of a day.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2302.06541,,#9132,Mozes 2023,,,0
Towards Emotional Support Dialog Systems,"Liu, Siyang; Zheng, Chujie; Demasi, Orianna; Sabour, Sahand; Li, Yu; Yu, Zhou; Jiang, Yong; Huang, Minlie","Emotional support is a crucial ability for many conversation scenarios, including social interactions, mental health support, and customer service chats. Following reasonable procedures and using various support skills can help to effectively provide support. However, due to the lack of a well-designed task and corpora of effective emotional support conversations, research on building emotional support into dialog systems remains lacking. In this paper, we define the Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) task and propose an ESC Framework, which is grounded on the Helping Skills Theory. We construct an Emotion Support Conversation dataset (ESConv) with rich annotation (especially support strategy) in a help-seeker and supporter mode. To ensure a corpus of high-quality conversations that provide examples of effective emotional support, we take extensive effort to design training tutorials for supporters and several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally, we evaluate state-of-the-art dialog models with respect to the ability to provide emotional support. Our results show the importance of support strategies in providing effective emotional support and the utility of ESConv in training more emotional support systems.",2021,,Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers),,,3469-3483,,10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.269,,#9133,Liu 2021,,,0

We find this alignment training improves performance on almost all NLP evaluations, and is fully compatible with training for specialized skills such as python coding and summarization. We explore an iterated online mode of training, where preference models and RL policies are updated on a weekly cadence with fresh human feedback data, efficiently improving our datasets and models. Finally, we investigate the robustness of RLHF training, and identify a roughly linear relation between the RL reward and the square root of the KL divergence between the policy and its initialization. Alongside our main results, we perform peripheral analyses on calibration, competing objectives, and the use of OOD detection, compare our models with human writers, and provide samples from our models using prompts appearing in recent related work.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2204.05862,,#9134,Bai 2022,,,0
Training language models to follow instructions with human feedback,"Ouyang, Long; Wu, Jeff; Jiang, Xu; Almeida, Diogo; Wainwright, Carroll L.; Mishkin, Pamela; Zhang, Chong; Agarwal, Sandhini; Slama, Katarina; Ray, Alex; Schulman, John; Hilton, Jacob; Kelton, Fraser; Miller, Luke; Simens, Maddie; Askell, Amanda; Welinder, Peter; Christiano, Paul; Leike, Jan; Lowe, Ryan","Making language models bigger does not inherently make them better at following a user's intent. For example, large language models can generate outputs that are untruthful, toxic, or simply not helpful to the user. In other words, these models are not aligned with their users. In this paper, we show an avenue for aligning language models with user intent on a wide range of tasks by fine-tuning with human feedback. Starting with a set of labeler-written prompts and prompts submitted through the OpenAI API, we collect a dataset of labeler demonstrations of the desired model behavior, which we use to fine-tune GPT-3 using supervised learning. We then collect a dataset of rankings of model outputs, which we use to further fine-tune this supervised model using reinforcement learning from human feedback. We call the resulting models InstructGPT. In human evaluations on our prompt distribution, outputs from the 1.3B parameter InstructGPT model are preferred to outputs from the 175B GPT-3, despite having 100x fewer parameters. Moreover, InstructGPT models show improvements in truthfulness and reductions in toxic output generation while having minimal performance regressions on public NLP datasets. Even though InstructGPT still makes simple mistakes, our results show that fine-tuning with human feedback is a promising direction for aligning language models with human intent.",2022,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2203.02155,,#9135,Ouyang 2022,,,0
Trust in AI and Its Role in the Acceptance of AI Technologies,"Choung, Hyesun; David, Prabu; Ross, Arun","As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants’ attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies. This research contributes to the advancement and application of the TAM in AI-related applications and offers a multidimensional measure of trust that can be utilized in the future study of trustworthy AI.",2023,,International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction,39,9,1727-1739,,10.1080/10447318.2022.2050543,,#9136,Choung 2023,,,0
"Use of LLMs for Illicit Purposes: Threats, Prevention Measures, and Vulnerabilities","Mozes, Maximilian; He, Xuanli; Kleinberg, Bennett; Griffin, Lewis D.","Spurred by the recent rapid increase in the development and distribution of large language models (LLMs) across industry and academia, much recent work has drawn attention to safety- and security-related threats and vulnerabilities of LLMs, including in the context of potentially criminal activities. Specifically, it has been shown that LLMs can be misused for fraud, impersonation, and the generation of malware; while other authors have considered the more general problem of AI alignment. It is important that developers and practitioners alike are aware of security-related problems with such models. In this paper, we provide an overview of existing - predominantly scientific - efforts on identifying and mitigating threats and vulnerabilities arising from LLMs. We present a taxonomy describing the relationship between threats caused by the generative capabilities of LLMs, prevention measures intended to address such threats, and vulnerabilities arising from imperfect prevention measures. With our work, we hope to raise awareness of the limitations of LLMs in light of such security concerns, among both experienced developers and novel users of such technologies.",2023,,,,,,,10.48550/arXiv.2308.12833,,#9139,Mozes 2023,,,0
Using Machine Learning to Learn Machines: A Cross-Cultural Study of Users’ Responses to Machine-Generated Artworks,"Xu, Kun; Liu, Fanjue; Mou, Yi; Wu, Yuheng; Zeng, Jing; Schäfer, Mike S.","Drawing from prior literature on machine-generated news, this study examines machine-generated artworks in a cross-cultural context. It combines machine learning approaches with online experiments and investigates how different genres of artworks and different authorship cues influence participants’ open-ended responses to machine-generated works. Results suggest that while genres and cultures affected participants’ discussion topics and word use, the differences between participants’ responses to machine-generated artworks and human-generated ones were not evident.

When algorithms meet journalism: The user perception to automated news in a cross-cultural context,"Zheng, Yue; Zhong, Bu; Yang, Fan","Automated journalism – the use of algorithms in writing news reports – underscores the new direction of media transformation in the 21st century as it may reshape how the news is produced and consumed. Such writing algorithms have been increasingly adopted in U.S. and Chinese newsroom, but how well they are accepted by news users deserves more research. A comparative study was thus conducted to examine how U.S. and Chinese news users perceive the quality of algorithm-generated news reports, how much they like and trust such reports. Results show that U.S. and Chinese users demonstrated more shared, rather than different, perceptions to automated news. The users did not perceive automated content in a linear way, but viewed them by considering the interaction of the authors (i.e., journalists or algorithms), the media outlets (i.e., traditional or online media) and cultural background (i.e., U.S. or Chinese users).",2018,,Computers in Human Behavior,86,,266-275,,10.1016/j.chb.2018.04.046,,#9145,Zheng 2018,,,0
"When people are defeated by artificial intelligence in a competition task requiring logical thinking, how do they make causal attribution?","Yokoi, Ryosuke; Nakayachi, Kazuya","Given that artificial intelligence (AI) has been predicted to eventually take on human tasks demanding logical thinking, it makes sense that we should examine psychological responses of humans when their performance is inferior to AI. Research has demonstrated that after people fail a task, whether they reorient their behavior towards success depends on what they attribute the failure to. This study investigated the causal attributions people made in a competition task requiring such thinking. We also recorded whether they wanted to re-challenge the games after they were defeated by AI. Experiments 1 (N = 74) and 2 (N = 788) recruited Japanese participants, while Experiment 3 (N = 500) comprised American participants. There were two conditions: in the first, participants competed against an AI opponent and in the other, they believed they were competing against a human. The results of the three experiments showed that participants attributed the loss to their own and their opponent’s abilities more than any other factor, irrespective of the opponent type. The number of participants choosing to re-challenge the game did not differ significantly between the AI and human conditions in Experiments 1 and 3, although the number was lower in the AI condition than in the human condition in Experiment 2. Besides providing fresh insight on how people make causal attributions when competing against AI, our findings also predict how people will respond after their jobs are replaced by AI.",2023,,Current Psychology,42,16,13369-13384,,10.1007/s12144-021-02559-w,,#9148,Yokoi 2023,,,0
When rational decision-making becomes irrational: a critical assessment and re-conceptualization of intuition effectiveness,"Julmi, Christian","Intuition can lead to more effective decision-making than analysis under certain conditions. This assumption can be regarded as common sense. However, dominant research streams on intuition effectiveness in decision-making conceptualize intuition inadequately, because intuition is considered either detrimental or as a form of analysis. Current findings in general intuition research show that intuition is a holistic form of information processing that is distinct from analysis and can be superior in some cases. To reconcile this mismatch, this article first critically assesses dominant conceptions on intuition effectiveness and then offers a re-conceptualization that builds on current findings of general intuition research. Basically, the article suggests the structuredness of the decision problem as the main criterion for intuition effectiveness, and proposes organization information processing theory to establish this link conceptually. It is not the uncertainty but the equivocality of decision problems that call for an intuitive approach. The article conclusively derives implications for further research and discusses potential restrictions and constraints.",2019,,Business Research,12,1,291-314,,10.1007/s40685-019-0096-4,,#9149,Julmi 2019,,,0
Who Is Included in Human Perceptions of AI?: Trust and Perceived Fairness around Healthcare AI and Cultural Mistrust,"Lee, Min Kyung; Rich, Katherine","Emerging research suggests that people trust algorithmic decisions less than human decisions. However, different populations, particularly in marginalized communities, may have different levels of trust in human decision-makers. Do people who mistrust human decision-makers perceive human decisions to be more trustworthy and fairer than algorithmic decisions? Or do they trust algorithmic decisions as much as or more than human decisions? We examine the role of mistrust in human systems in people’s perceptions of algorithmic decisions. We focus on healthcare Artificial Intelligence (AI), group-based medical mistrust, and Black people in the United States. We conducted a between-subjects online experiment to examine people’s perceptions of skin cancer screening decisions made by an AI versus a human physician depending on their medical mistrust, and we conducted interviews to understand how to cultivate trust in healthcare AI. Our findings highlight that research around human experiences of AI should consider critical differences in social groups.",2021,,Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,,,Jan-14,,10.1145/3411764.3445570,,#9150,Lee 2021,,,0

Moreover, a customer's mind perception of the AI chatbot, including perceived agency and perceived experience, moderated the central and peripheral paths, respectively.This study has theoretical and practical implications for AI chatbot designers and provides management insights for practitioners to enhance a customer's intention to adopt an AI chatbot's recommendation.The study investigates customers' adoption of AI chatbots' recommendation.The authors develop research model based on ELM theory to reveal central and peripheral cues and paths.The central and peripheral cues are generalized according to cooperative principle theory.Central cues include recommendation reliability and accuracy, and peripheral cues include human-like empathy and recommendation choice.Central and peripheral cues affect customers' adoption to recommendation through trust in AI.Customers' mind perception positively moderates the central and peripheral paths.",2023,,Information Technology & People,38,2,937-962,,10.1108/ITP-10-2021-0764,,#9152,Chen 2023,,,0
Algorithmic or Human Source? Examining Relative Hostile Media Effect With a Transformer-Based Framework,"Jia, Chenyan; Liu, Ruibo","The relative hostile media effect suggests that partisans tend to perceive the bias of slanted news differently depending on whether the news is slanted in favor of or against their sides. To explore the effect of an algorithmic vs. human source on hostile media perceptions, this study conducts a 3 (author attribution: human, algorithm, or human-assisted algorithm) x 3 (news attitude: pro-issue, neutral, or anti-issue) mixed factorial design online experiment (N = 511). This study uses a transformer-based adversarial network to auto-generate comparable news headlines. The framework was trained with a dataset of 364,986 news stories from 22 mainstream media outlets. The results show that the relative hostile media effect occurs when people read news headlines attributed to all types of authors. News attributed to a sole human source is perceived as more credible than news attributed to two algorithm-related sources. For anti-Trump news headlines, there exists an interaction effect between author attribution and issue partisanship while controlling for people’s prior belief in machine heuristics. The difference of hostile media perceptions between the two partisan groups was relatively larger in anti-Trump news headlines compared with pro-Trump news headlines.",2021,,Media and Communication,9,4,170-181,,10.17645/mac.v9i4.4164,,#9154,Jia 2021,,,0
