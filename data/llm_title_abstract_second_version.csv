This can be considered a deliberate attempt to persuade or shape attitudes, as it aims to understand how different factors influence user decisions.",Yes,"The study explicitly mentions the use of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system as a recommender, which aligns with the criterion of using an LLM or LLM-based conversational agent to deliver persuasive messages.",Yes,"The article reports on an empirical study, specifically a between-subjects online experiment, which meets the criterion of being an empirical study reporting on primary data.",Yes,"Although the study involves recommendations for business profiles, its primary goal is to understand the influence of AI systems on user judgments, rather than promoting a commercial product or service. Therefore, it does not meet the exclusion criterion of having a primary persuasive goal that is commercial.",No
#9147,Exclude,"The study involves human participants who performed cognitive tasks and received feedback, thus meeting the criterion of involving human participants and reporting on data collected from them.",Yes,"The study does not explicitly investigate a deliberate attempt to persuade or shape attitudes, beliefs, or behaviors using messages. Instead, it focuses on the effects of negative feedback on performance and subjective state, which does not align with the persuasion intent required by this criterion.",No,"The study does involve the use of a computer to deliver negative feedback, which can be considered as a form of message delivery. However, it does not explicitly state the use of an LLM or an LLM-based conversational agent for this purpose, which is a requirement for meeting this criterion.",No,"The article reports on two experiments, which are empirical studies collecting primary data. This meets the requirement for the study type.",Yes,"The primary persuasive goal of the study is not commercial, as it focuses on the effects of negative feedback in a work-related setting rather than marketing, advertising, or sales.",No
