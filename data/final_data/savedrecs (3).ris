TI  - LC-LLM: Explainable lane-change intention and trajectory predictions with Large Language Models
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS IN TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH
AB  - To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a Lane Change-Large Language Model (LC-LLM), an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for understanding driving behavior.

TI  - Empowering Calibrated (Dis-)Trust in Conversational Agents: A User Study on the Persuasive Power of Limitation Disclaimers vs. Authoritative Style
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYTEMS, CHI 2024
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Sytems (CHI)
AB  - While conversational agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can drive progress in many domains, they are prone to generating faulty information. To ensure an efficient, safe, and satisfactory user experience maximizing benefits of these systems, users must be empowered to judge the reliability of system outputs. In this, both disclaimers and agents' communicative style are pivotal design instances. In an online study with 594 participants, we investigated how these affect users' trust and a mock-up agent's persuasiveness, based on an established framework from social psychology. While prior information on potential inaccuracies or faulty information did not affect trust, an authoritative communicative style elicited more trust. Also, a trusted agent was more persuasive resulting in more positive attitudes regarding the subject of the conversation. Results imply that disclaimers on agents' limitations fail to effectively alter users' trust but can be supported by appropriate communicative style during interaction.

TI  - Adaptive System Architecture for Health Behavior Change: Harnessing the Power of Large Language Models
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 57TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
CP  - 57th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
AB  - In this paper, we present a novel adaptive system architecture for positive health behavior change. Leveraging an advanced large language model as a knowledgebase, the system automatically generates personalized behavior change plans based on individual needs. It utilizes established health behavior change theories to provide timely, context-specific interventions and nudges. We outline the system's key components and functionality, demonstrating its adaptability through a structured walkthrough of "Achieve healthy weight" and "Manage Job-Related Stress" scenarios. We demonstrate that system dynamically adapts its recommendations based on users' evolving behaviors, intentions, circumstances, and stage in the behavior change process, ensuring ongoing relevance and effectiveness. The paper highlights the potential of a large language model to serve as a knowledge base in health behavior change support systems.

TI  - On LLM Wizards: Identifying Large Language Models' Behaviors for Wizard of Oz Experiments
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 24TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2024
CP  - 24th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents
AB  - The Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method is a widely adopted research approach where a human Wizard "role-plays" a not readily available technology and interacts with participants to elicit user behaviors and probe the design space. With the growing ability for modern large language models (LLMs) to role-play, one can apply LLMs as Wizards in WoZ experiments with better scalability and lower cost than the traditional approach. However, methodological guidance on responsibly applying LLMs in WoZ experiments and a systematic evaluation of LLMs' role-playing ability are lacking. Through two LLM-powered WoZ studies, we take the first step towards identifying an experiment lifecycle for researchers to safely integrate LLMs into WoZ experiments and interpret data generated from settings that involve Wizards role-played by LLMs. We also contribute a heuristic-based evaluation framework that allows the estimation of LLMs' role-playing ability in WoZ experiments and reveals LLMs' behavior patterns at scale.

TI  - The Mixed Blessing of Leaders' Artificial Intelligence (AI)-oriented Change Behavior: Implications for Employee Job Performance and Unethical Behavior
T2  - APPLIED RESEARCH IN QUALITY OF LIFE
AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has led many companies to embrace AI-oriented changes; leaders' AI-oriented change behaviors have therefore become increasingly prevalent in contemporary organizations. However, knowledge on the effects of such behavior remains limited. Additionally, literature on change-oriented behavior (e.g., taking charge, change-oriented citizenship) has uniformly demonstrated that it is beneficial for employees, teams, and organizations. We challenge this consensus by revealing that leaders' AI-oriented change behavior has mixed effects on employee outcomes. In Study 1, we developed a scale for leaders' AI-oriented change behavior and assessed its psychometric properties using samples from the United States. In Study 2, we tested our full model with a three-wave, multi-source field study in China. The results show that leaders' AI-oriented change behavior is positively associated with employee performance orientation, in turn increasing both employee job performance and unethical behaviors. Furthermore, employee trait competitiveness moderates the positive effect of leaders' AI-oriented change behavior on employee job performance and unethical behavior via employee performance orientation. By revealing the perils and benefits of leaders' AI-oriented change behavior, our research contributes to the literature on change-oriented behavior and performance orientation.

TI  - Virtual Agents for Alcohol Use Counseling: Exploring LLM-Powered Motivational Interviewing
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 24TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2024
CP  - 24th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents
AB  - We introduce a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in developing a virtual counselor capable of conducting motivational interviewing (MI) for alcohol use counseling. Access to effective counseling remains limited, particularly for substance abuse, and virtual agents offer a promising solution by leveraging LLM capabilities to simulate nuanced communication techniques inherent in MI. Our approach combines prompt engineering and integration into a user-friendly virtual platform to facilitate realistic, empathetic interactions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our virtual agent through a series of studies focusing on replicating MI techniques and human counselor dialog. Initial findings suggest that our LLM-powered virtual agent matches human counselors' empathetic and adaptive conversational skills, presenting a significant step forward in virtual health counseling and providing insights into the design and implementation of LLM-based therapeutic interactions.

TI  - Changes in attitudes toward meat consumption after chatting with a large language model
T2  - SOCIAL INFLUENCE
AB  - Researchers have started to explore the persuasive power of large language models (LLMs) and initial results suggest that LLMs can be as persuasive as humans, even for controversial and moralized topics. We conducted a preregistered proof-of-concept study to test how a brief conversation with ChatGPT-4o influences attitudes and beliefs about meat consumption. We found that participants (n = 101) reported weaker commitment to eating meat and weaker beliefs that eating meat is necessary and natural, but not weaker beliefs that eating meat is normal or nice, after their conversation (vs. before). Our study provides preliminary evidence and can act as a blueprint for future explorations of how conversations with LLMs can change attitudes on meat consumption and related topics.

TI  - Context-Aware Behavioral Tips to Improve Sleep Quality via Machine Learning and Large Language Models
T2  - FUTURE INTERNET
AB  - As several studies demonstrate, good sleep quality is essential for individuals' well-being, as a lack of restoring sleep may disrupt different physical, mental, and social dimensions of health. For this reason, there is increasing interest in tools for the monitoring of sleep based on personal sensors. However, there are currently few context-aware methods to help individuals to improve their sleep quality through behavior change tips. In order to tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a system that couples machine learning algorithms and large language models to forecast the next night's sleep quality, and to provide context-aware behavior change tips to improve sleep. In order to encourage adherence and to increase trust, our system includes the use of large language models to describe the conditions that the machine learning algorithm finds harmful to sleep health, and to explain why the behavior change tips are generated as a consequence. We develop a prototype of our system, including a smartphone application, and perform experiments with a set of users. Results show that our system's forecast is correlated to the actual sleep quality. Moreover, a preliminary user study suggests that the use of large language models in our system is useful in increasing trust and engagement.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs within a business context. Specifically, we employ LLMs to devise a sales strategy geared towards maximizing customer values (benefits and satisfaction). This sales plan encompasses five iterative stages: market landscape survey, customer profiling, product usage analysis, sales strategy formulation, and crafting persuasive pitches and materials. We leverage LLMs to supplement the limited data available to the company, aiming to enhance the efficacy of each stage and optimize KPIs, including the value-oriented sales conversion and profitability. Due to confidentiality and trade secret concerns, we blend artificial data with genuine data to ensure customer anonymity and protect sales playbooks. Despite these precautions, we effectively demonstrate our methodology of harnessing LLMs to refine the sales planning procedure.

TI  - The potential and limitations of large language models in identification of the states of motivations for facilitating health behavior change
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL INFORMATICS ASSOCIATION
AB  - Importance The study highlights the potential and limitations of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in recognizing different states of motivation to provide appropriate information for behavior change. Following the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), we identified the major gap of LLMs in responding to certain states of motivation through validated scenario studies, suggesting future directions of LLMs research for health promotion.Objectives The LLMs-based generative conversational agents (GAs) have shown success in identifying user intents semantically. Little is known about its capabilities to identify motivation states and provide appropriate information to facilitate behavior change progression.Materials and Methods We evaluated 3 GAs, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Llama 2 in identifying motivation states following the TTM stages of change. GAs were evaluated using 25 validated scenarios with 5 health topics across 5 TTM stages. The relevance and completeness of the responses to cover the TTM processes to proceed to the next stage of change were assessed.Results 3 GAs identified the motivation states in the preparation stage providing sufficient information to proceed to the action stage. The responses to the motivation states in the action and maintenance stages were good enough covering partial processes for individuals to initiate and maintain their changes in behavior. However, the GAs were not able to identify users' motivation states in the precontemplation and contemplation stages providing irrelevant information, covering about 20%-30% of the processes.Discussion GAs are able to identify users' motivation states and provide relevant information when individuals have established goals and commitments to take and maintain an action. However, individuals who are hesitant or ambivalent about behavior change are unlikely to receive sufficient and relevant guidance to proceed to the next stage of change.Conclusion The current GAs effectively identify motivation states of individuals with established goals but may lack support for those ambivalent towards behavior change.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYTEMS, CHI 2024
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Sytems (CHI)
AB  - Creating intervention messages for smoking cessation is a labor-intensive process. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for automated message generation. Two critical questions remain: 1) How to optimize LLMs to mimic human expert writing, and 2) Do LLM-generated messages meet clinical standards? We systematically examined the message generation and evaluation processes through three studies investigating prompt engineering (Study 1), decoding optimization (Study 2), and expert review (Study 3). We employed computational linguistic analysis in LLM assessment and established a comprehensive evaluation framework, incorporating automated metrics, linguistic attributes, and expert evaluations. Certified tobacco treatment specialists assessed the quality, accuracy, credibility, and persuasiveness of LLM-generated messages, using expert-written messages as the benchmark. Results indicate that larger LLMs, including ChatGPT, OPT-13B, and OPT-30B, can effectively emulate expert writing to generate well-written, accurate, and persuasive messages, thereby demonstrating the capability of LLMs in augmenting clinical practices of smoking cessation interventions.

TI  - The benefits and dangers of anthropomorphic conversational agents
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - A growing body of research suggests that the recent generation of large language model (LLMs) excel, and in many cases outpace humans, at writing persuasively and empathetically, at inferring user traits from text, and at mimicking human-like conversation believably and effectively-without possessing any true empathy or social understanding. We refer to these systems as "anthropomorphic conversational agents" to aptly conceptualize the ability of LLM-based systems to mimic human communication so convincingly that they become increasingly indistinguishable from human interlocutors. This ability challenges the many efforts that caution against "anthropomorphizing" LLMs, attaching human-like qualities to nonhuman entities. When the systems themselves exhibit human-like qualities, calls to resist anthropomorphism will increasingly fall flat. While the AI industry directs much effort into improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs-with mixed results-the progress in communicative abilities remains underappreciated. In this perspective, we aim to raise awareness for both the benefits and dangers of anthropomorphic agents. We ask: should we lean into the human-like abilities, or should we aim to dehumanize LLM-based systems, given concerns over anthropomorphic seduction? When users cannot tell the difference between human interlocutors and AI systems, threats emerge of deception, manipulation, and disinformation at scale. We suggest that we must engage with anthropomorphic agents across design and development, deployment and use, and regulation and policy-making. We outline in detail implications and associated research questions.

T2  - 2024 IEEE/CVF CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER VISION AND PATTERN RECOGNITION (CVPR)
CP  - IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR)
AB  - Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-Of-Context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which are essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle cross-modal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on Instruct-BLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages OOC-specific instruction data generated by language-only GPT-4 to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.

TI  - Evaluating the persuasive influence of political microtargeting with large language models
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised the prospect of scalable, automated, and fine- grained political microtargeting on a scale previously unseen; however, the persuasive influence of microtargeting with LLMs remains unclear. Here, we build a custom web application capable of integrating self- reported demographic and political data into GPT- 4 prompts in real- time, facilitating the live creation of unique messages tailored to persuade individual users on four political issues. We then deploy this application in a preregistered randomized control experiment (n = 8,587) to investigate the extent to which access to individual- level data increases the persuasive influence of GPT- 4. Our approach yields two key findings. First, messages generated by GPT- 4 were broadly persuasive, in some cases increasing support for an issue stance by up to 12 percentage points. Second, in aggregate, the persuasive impact of microtargeted messages was not statistically different from that of non- microtargeted messages (4.83 vs. 6.20 percentage points, respectively, P = 0.226). These trends hold even when manipulating the type and number of attributes used to tailor the message. These findings suggest- contrary to widespread speculation-that the influence of current LLMs may reside not in their ability to tailor messages to individuals but rather in the persuasiveness of their generic, nontargeted messages. We release our experimental dataset, GPTarget2024, as an empirical baseline for future research.

We developed a custom classification head designed to be applied atop of a Large Language Model, reconstructing hierarchical relationships through multiple fully connected layers. This approach incorporates the decisions of foundational layers in subsequent, more fine-grained layers. To improve performance, we conducted a small hyperparameter search across various models and explored strategies for addressing uneven label distributions including weighted loss and thresholding methods. Furthermore, we extended our preprocessing to compete in the multilingual setup of the task by translating all documents into English. Finally, our system achieved third place on the English dataset and first place on the Bulgarian, North Macedonian and Arabic test datasets.

TI  - Credit scoring model for fintech lending: An integration of large language models and FocalPoly loss
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
AB  - Fintech lending experiences high credit risk and needs an efficient credit scoring model, but it also faces limited data sources and severe class imbalance. We develop a novel two-stage credit scoring model (called LLM-FP-CatBoost) by solving the two issues simultaneously. Large language models (LLMs) initially extract narrative data as a supplementary credit dataset. A new FocalPoly loss is then incorporated with CatBoost to handle the class imbalance problem. Extensive comparisons demonstrate that the proposed LLM-FP-CatBoost significantly outperforms the benchmarks in most circumstances. When making pairwise comparisons between LLMs on the fintech lending dataset, we found that the Chinese-specific LLM, i.e., ERNIE 4.0, achieves the best overall performance, followed by GPT-4 and BERT-based models. The performance decomposition reveals that the superiority is mainly attributed to the new data source extracted by the LLMs. The SHAP algorithm further ensures the interpretability of LLM-FP-CatBoost. The superiority of the proposed LLM-FP-CatBoost model remains robust to hyperparameters of the loss function, specific LLMs, and other extraction methods of narrative data. Finally, we discuss some managerial implications concerning credit scoring in fintech lending. (c) 2024 International Institute of Forecasters. Published by Elsevier B.V.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH CONFERENCE ON ACM CONVERSATIONAL USER INTERFACES, CUI 2024
CP  - 6th ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)
AB  - Searching through conversational interactions has been emphasized as the next frontier. Nowadays, conversational agents can generate natural language responses, transforming how we search for information. A key challenge in conversational information-seeking is how these agents present information: should they only reflect facts, cater to human cognitive preferences, or strike a balance between them? These challenges raise questions about aligning conversational agents with human cognitive processes. Our position paper emphasizes the role of narrative in addressing these questions. We explore how narratives influence human comprehension and propose a framework for optimal conversational narratives. These narratives aim to enhance interaction between humans and conversational agents in explanatory information-seeking scenarios.

TI  - Disinformation Detection: An Evolving Challenge in the Age of LLMs
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 SIAM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA MINING, SDM
CP  - SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM)
AB  - The advent of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has catalyzed transformative advancements across multiple domains. However, alongside these advancements, they have also introduced potential threats. One critical concern is the misuse of LLMs by disinformation spreaders, leveraging these models to generate highly persuasive yet misleading content that challenges the disinformation detection system. This work aims to address this issue by answering three research questions: (1) To what extent can the current disinformation detection technique reliably detect LLM-generated disinformation? (2) If traditional techniques prove less effective, can LLMs themself be exploited to serve as a robust defense against advanced disinformation? and, (3) Should both these strategies falter, what novel approaches can be proposed to counter this burgeoning threat effectively? A holistic exploration for the formation and detection of disinformation is conducted to foster this line of research.

TI  - How persuasive is AI-generated propaganda?
T2  - PNAS NEXUS
AB  - Can large language models, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), generate persuasive propaganda? We conducted a preregistered survey experiment of US respondents to investigate the persuasiveness of news articles written by foreign propagandists compared to content generated by GPT-3 davinci (a large language model). We found that GPT-3 can create highly persuasive text as measured by participants' agreement with propaganda theses. We further investigated whether a person fluent in English could improve propaganda persuasiveness. Editing the prompt fed to GPT-3 and/or curating GPT-3's output made GPT-3 even more persuasive, and, under certain conditions, as persuasive as the original propaganda. Our findings suggest that propagandists could use AI to create convincing content with limited effort.

TI  - Infusing behavior science into large language models for activity coaching
T2  - PLOS DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for task-oriented dialogue across a range of domains. The use of LLMs in health and fitness coaching is under-explored. Behavior science frameworks such as COM-B, which conceptualizes behavior change in terms of capability (C), Opportunity (O) and Motivation (M), can be used to architect coaching interventions in a way that promotes sustained change. Here we aim to incorporate behavior science principles into an LLM using two knowledge infusion techniques: coach message priming (where exemplar coach responses are provided as context to the LLM), and dialogue re-ranking (where the COM-B category of the LLM output is matched to the inferred user need). Simulated conversations were conducted between the primed or unprimed LLM and a member of the research team, and then evaluated by 8 human raters. Ratings for the primed conversations were significantly higher in terms of empathy and actionability. The same raters also compared a single response generated by the unprimed, primed and reranked models, finding a significant uplift in actionability and empathy from the re-ranking technique. This is a proof of concept of how behavior science frameworks can be infused into automated conversational agents for a more principled coaching experience.

TI  - MindShif: Leveraging Large Language Models for Mental-States-Based Problematic Smartphone Use Intervention
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYTEMS (CHI 2024)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Sytems (CHI)
AB  - Problematic smartphone use negatively affects physical and mental health. Despite the wide range of prior research, existing persuasive techniques are not flexible enough to provide dynamic persuasion content based on users' physical contexts and mental states. We first conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=12) and an interview study (N=10) to summarize the mental states behind problematic smartphone use: boredom, stress, and inertia. This informs our design of four persuasion strategies: understanding, comforting, evoking, and scaffolding habits. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) to enable the automatic and dynamic generation of effective persuasion content. We developed MindShift, a novel LLM-powered problematic smartphone use intervention technique. MindShift takes users' in-the-moment app usage behaviors, physical contexts, mental states, goals & habits as input, and generates personalized and dynamic persuasive content with appropriate persuasion strategies. We conducted a 5-week field experiment (N=25) to compare MindShift with its simplified version (remove mental states) and baseline techniques (fixed reminder). The results show that MindShift improves intervention acceptance rates by 4.7-22.5% and reduces smartphone usage duration by 7.4-9.8%. Moreover, users have a significant drop in smartphone addiction scale scores and a rise in self-efficacy scale scores. Our study sheds light on the potential of leveraging LLMs for context-aware persuasion in other behavior change domains.

TI  - Kernels of selfhood: GPT-4o shows humanlike patterns of cognitive dissonance moderated by free choice
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) show emergent patterns that mimic human cognition. We explore whether they also mirror other, less deliberative human psychological processes. Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies tested whether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive or negative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitude change mimicking cognitive dissonance effects in humans. Even more remarkably, the degree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice about which essay (positive or negative) to write, suggesting that GPT-4o manifests a functional analog of humanlike selfhood. The exact mechanisms by which the model mimics human attitude change and self-referential processing remain to be understood.

TI  - Designing a Large Language Model-Based Coaching Intervention for Lifestyle Behavior Change
T2  - DESIGN SCIENCE RESEARCH FOR A RESILIENT FUTURE, DESRIST 2024
CP  - 19th International Conference on Design Science Research in Information Systems and Technology (DESRIST) - Design Science Research for a Resilient Future
AB  - Adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regular exercise and balanced nutrition remain challenging despite their well-documented benefits for preventing chronic diseases and promoting overall well-being. Motivational Interviewing (MI) has emerged as a promising technique to address ambivalence and facilitate behavior change. However, traditional face-to-face delivery of MI interventions is limited by scalability and accessibility issues. Leveraging recent advancements in LLMs, this paper proposes an innovative approach to deliver MI-based coaching for lifestyle behavior change digitally. Following a problem-centered DSR approach, we created an initial prototype based on MI theory and qualitative user interviews using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5). We evaluated our prototype in a qualitative study. Our research outcomes include five design principles and thirteen system requirements. This research enhances the design knowledge base in LLM-based health coaching. It marks an essential first step towards designing LLM-based MI interventions, contributing valuable insights for future research in this emerging field.

TI  - Negotiating with LLMs: Prompt Hacks, Skill Gaps, and Reasoning Deficits
T2  - COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION RESEARCH AND APPLICATIONS, CHIRA 2024, PT II
CP  - 8th International Conference on Computer-Human Interaction Research and Applications-CHIRA-Annual
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have reached the 100 million users' barrier in record time and might increasingly enter all areas of our life leading to a diverse set of interactions between those Artificial Intelligence models and humans. While many studies have discussed governance and regulations deductively from first order principles, few studies provide an inductive, data-driven lens based on observing dialogues between humans and LLMs - especially, when it comes to non-collaborative, competitive situations that have the potential to pose a serious threat for people. In this work, we conduct a user study engaging 41 individuals across all age groups in price negotiations with an LLM. We explore how people interact with an LLM, investigating differences in negotiation outcomes and strategies. Furthermore, we highlight shortcomings of LLMs with respect to their reasoning capabilities and, in turn, susceptiveness to prompt hacking, which intends to manipulate the LLM to make agreements that are against its instructions or beyond any rationality. We also show that the negotiated prices humans manage to achieve span a broad range, which points to a literacy gap in effectively interacting with LLMs.

TI  - Persuading across Diverse Domains: A Dataset and Persuasion Large Language Model
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - Persuasive dialogue requires multi-turn following and planning abilities to achieve the goal of persuading users, which is still challenging even for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Previous works focus on retrieval-based models or generative models in a specific domain due to a lack of data across multiple domains. In this paper, we leverage GPT-4 to create the first multi-domain persuasive dialogue dataset DailyPersuasion. Then we propose a general method named PersuGPT to learn a persuasion model based on LLMs through intent-to-strategy reasoning, which summarizes the intent of user's utterance and reasons next strategy to respond. Moreover, we design a simulation-based preference optimization, which utilizes a learned user model and our model to simulate next turns and estimate their rewards more accurately. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms all baselines in terms of automatic evaluation metric Win-Rate and human evaluation. The code and data are available at https://persugpt.github.io.

TI  - Toward the Adoption of Explainable Pre-Trained Large Language Models for Classifying Human-Written and AI-Generated Sentences
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, including understanding, writing, and performing many tasks in natural language. Moreover, with time and improvements in training and text generation techniques, these models are proving efficient at generating increasingly human-like content. However, they can also be modified to generate persuasive, contextual content weaponized for malicious purposes, including disinformation and novel social engineering attacks. In this paper, we present a study on identifying human- and AI-generated content using different models. Precisely, we fine-tune different models belonging to the BERT family, an open-source version of the GPT model, ELECTRA, and XLNet, and then perform a text classification task using two different labeled datasets-the first one consisting of 25,000 sentences generated by both AI and humans and the second comprising 22,929 abstracts that are ChatGPT-generated and written by humans. Furthermore, we perform an additional phase where we submit 20 sentences generated by ChatGPT and 20 sentences randomly extracted from Wikipedia to our fine-tuned models to verify the efficiency and robustness of the latter. In order to understand the prediction of the models, we performed an explainability phase using two sentences: one generated by the AI and one written by a human. We leveraged the integrated gradients and token importance techniques, analyzing the words and subwords of the two sentences. As a result of the first experiment, we achieved an average accuracy of 99%, precision of 98%, recall of 99%, and F1-score of 99%. For the second experiment, we reached an average accuracy of 51%, precision of 50%, recall of 52%, and F1-score of 51%.

TI  - Combining the Strengths of LLMs and Persuasive Technology to Combat Cyberhate
T2  - COMPUTERS
AB  - Cyberhate presents a multifaceted, context-sensitive challenge that existing detection methods often struggle to tackle effectively. Large language models (LLMs) exhibit considerable potential for improving cyberhate detection due to their advanced contextual understanding. However, detection alone is insufficient; it is crucial for software to also promote healthier user behaviors and empower individuals to actively confront the spread of cyberhate. This study investigates whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with persuasive technology (PT) can effectively detect cyberhate and encourage prosocial user behavior in digital spaces. Through an empirical study, we examine users' perceptions of a self-monitoring persuasive strategy designed to reduce cyberhate. Specifically, the study introduces the Comment Analysis Feature to limit cyberhate spread, utilizing a prompt-based fine-tuning approach combined with LLMs. By framing users' comments within the relevant context of cyberhate, the feature classifies input as either cyberhate or non-cyberhate and generates context-aware alternative statements when necessary to encourage more positive communication. A case study evaluated its real-world performance, examining user comments, detection accuracy, and the impact of alternative statements on user engagement and perception. The findings indicate that while most of the users (83%) found the suggestions clear and helpful, some resisted them, either because they felt the changes were irrelevant or misaligned with their intended expression (15%) or because they perceived them as a form of censorship (36%). However, a substantial number of users (40%) believed the interventions enhanced their language and overall commenting tone, with 68% suggesting they could have a positive long-term impact on reducing cyberhate. These insights highlight the potential of combining LLMs and PT to promote healthier online discourse while underscoring the need to address user concerns regarding relevance, intent, and freedom of expression.

TI  - Controllable Mixed-Initiative Dialogue Generation through Prompting
T2  - 61ST CONFERENCE OF THE THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, ACL 2023, VOL 2
CP  - 61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)
AB  - Mixed-initiative dialogue tasks involve repeated exchanges of information and conversational control. Conversational agents gain control by generating responses that follow particular dialogue intents or strategies, prescribed by a policy planner. The standard approach has been fine-tuning pre-trained language models to perform generation conditioned on these intents. However, these supervised generation models are limited by the cost and quality of data annotation. We instead prompt large language models as a drop-in replacement to fine-tuning on conditional generation. We formalize prompt construction for controllable mixed-initiative dialogue. Our findings show improvements over fine-tuning and ground truth responses according to human evaluation and automatic metrics for two tasks: PersuasionForGood and Emotional Support Conversations.

CP  - CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
AB  - Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human-like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work frst examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found signifcant linguistic diferences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a signifcant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation.

T2  - 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP 2023)
CP  - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
AB  - The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has shown great potential to develop more powerful conversational recommender systems (CRSs), which rely on natural language conversations to satisfy user needs. In this paper, we embark on an investigation into the utilization of ChatGPT for CRSs, revealing the inadequacy of the existing evaluation protocol. It might overemphasize the matching with ground-truth items annotated by humans while neglecting the interactive nature of CRSs.
   To overcome the limitation, we further propose an interactive Evaluation approach based on LLMs, named iEvaLM, which harnesses LLM-based user simulators. Our evaluation approach can simulate various system-user interaction scenarios. Through the experiments on two public CRS datasets, we demonstrate notable improvements compared to the prevailing evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we emphasize the evaluation of explainability, and ChatGPT showcases persuasive explanation generation for its recommendations. Our study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the untapped potential of LLMs for CRSs and provides a more flexible and realistic evaluation approach for future research about LLMbased CRSs. The code is available at https: //github.com/RUCAIBox/iEvaLM-CRS.

T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: ACL 2024
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - Psychological inoculation, a strategy to build resistance against persuasive misinformation, has been shown to reduce its spread and adverse effects. Although these inoculations are effective, the design and optimization of them typically require substantial financial and human resources. To address these challenges, this work introduces Simulated Misinformation Susceptibility Test (SMIST), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate participant responses in misinformation studies. SMIST employs a life experience-driven simulation methodology, which accounts for various aspects of participants' backgrounds, to mitigate common issues of caricatures and stereotypes in LLM simulations and enhance response diversity. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that SMIST, utilizing GPT4 as the backend model, yields results that align closely with those obtained from human-subject studies in misinformation susceptibility. This alignment suggests that LLMs can effectively serve as proxies in evaluating the impact of psychological inoculations. Further, SMIST can be applied to emerging and anticipated misinformation scenarios without harming human participants, thereby expanding the scope of misinformation research.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - We investigate intention detection in persuasive multi-turn dialogues employing the largest available Large Language Models (LLMs). Much of the prior research measures the intention detection capability of machine learning models without considering the conversational history. To evaluate LLMs' intention detection capability in conversation, we modified the existing datasets of persuasive conversation and created datasets using a multiple-choice paradigm.(1) It is crucial to consider others' perspectives through their utterances when engaging in a persuasive conversation, especially when making a request or reply that is inconvenient for others. This feature makes the persuasive dialogue suitable for the dataset of measuring intention detection capability. We incorporate the concept of face acts, which categorize how utterances affect mental states. This approach enables us to measure intention detection capability by focusing on crucial intentions and to conduct comprehensible analysis according to intention types.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2024 29TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES, IUI 2024
CP  - 29th ACM Annual International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI)
AB  - The adoption of recommender systems (RSs) in various domains has become increasingly popular, but concerns have been raised about their lack of transparency and interpretability. While significant advancements have been made in creating explainable RSs, there is still a shortage of automated approaches that can deliver meaningful and contextual human-centered explanations. Numerous researchers have evaluated explanations based on human-generated recommendations and explanations to address this gap. However, such approaches do not scale for real-world systems. Building on recent research that exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) for RSs, we propose leveraging the conversational capabilities of ChatGPT to provide users with personalized, human-like, and meaningful explanations for recommended items. Our paper presents one of the first user studies that measure users' perceptions of ChatGPT-generated explanations while acting as an RS. Regarding recommendations, we assess whether users prefer ChatGPT over random (but popular) recommendations. Concerning explanations, we assess users' perceptions of personalization, effectiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings reveal that users tend to prefer ChatGPT-generated recommendations over popular ones. Additionally, personalized rather than generic explanations prove to be more effective when the recommended item is unfamiliar.

TI  - A large language model-based platform for real-time building monitoring and occupant interaction
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUILDING ENGINEERING
AB  - Effective management of indoor environments requires a comprehensive evaluation of health, energy consumption, and thermal comfort. However, real-time assessment of these factors is challenging due to the lack of integrated applications that combine IoT technology, real-time simulation, and user-friendly interfaces for communication. To address these challenges, this research introduces a novel platform specifically designed to manage health, energy consumption, and thermal comfort in smart buildings, leveraging IoT-based building information modeling (BIM), cloud computing, and an AI-powered conversational suggestion system based on the large language model (GPT). The platform integrates real-time monitoring, simulation, alerting, and persuasion capabilities to manage health, energy consumption, and thermal comfort, enabling responsive building environment controls by assessing tradeoffs among these dimensions and providing timely recommendations. Additionally, it employs persuasive techniques to encourage occupants to adopt environmentally-friendly practices. A case study in a university building demonstrated the platform's functionality and visualization capability. A survey assessing the persuasive system revealed high adoption rates-95.59 % for switching rooms to improve indoor air quality and health, and 79.90 % for adjusting clothing to enhance thermal comfort-indicating strong participant willingness to adopt sustainable practices through the platform's strategies. The key contribution of this research is the development of a comprehensive, real-time platform that enhances indoor environmental quality and sustainability through advanced monitoring, analysis, and social interaction.

TI  - Generative propaganda: Evidence of AI's impact from a state-backed disinformation campaign
T2  - PNAS NEXUS
AB  - Can AI bolster state-backed propaganda campaigns, in practice? Growing use of AI and large language models has drawn attention to the potential for accompanying tools to be used by malevolent actors. Though recent laboratory and experimental evidence has substantiated these concerns in principle, the usefulness of AI tools in the production of propaganda campaigns has remained difficult to ascertain. Drawing on the adoption of generative-AI techniques by a state-affiliated propaganda site with ties to Russia, we test whether AI adoption enabled the website to amplify and enhance its production of disinformation. First, we find that the use of generative-AI tools facilitated the outlet's generation of larger quantities of disinformation. Second, we find that use of generative-AI coincided with shifts in the volume and breadth of published content. Finally, drawing on a survey experiment comparing perceptions of articles produced prior to and following the adoption of AI tools, we show that the AI-assisted articles maintained their persuasiveness in the postadoption period. Our results illustrate how generative-AI tools have already begun to alter the size and scope of state-backed propaganda campaigns.

TI  - Can Large Language Models Transform Computational Social Science?
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers' gold references. We conclude that the performance of today's LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans.

TI  - Harnessing Large Language Models for Automatic Evaluation of Mobile Health Applications Based on Persuasive System Design Principles and Mobile Application Rating Scale
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2024
CP  - 19th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - Mobile applications have seen a growing prevalence in the healthcare sector, yet the absence of comprehensive regulations and preliminary assessments can lead to significant frustration and time loss for users. To address this, Persuasive System Design (PSD) principles and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) have emerged as popular tools for gauging application quality and user engagement. However, their manual assessment requirements hinder scalability, especially given the high volume of mobile health applications in the market. This study introduces a novel automatic evaluation approach designed to enhance the assessment of mobile health applications, leveraging PSD and MARS. The proposed method mainly relies on large language models to filter user reviews and generate sentence embeddings for classifying the PSD principles implemented in these applications. The results, calculated using performance metrics that compare the model's predictions with expert evaluations, demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the application's implementation of PSD principles based on user reviews while also highlighting the limitations of using application descriptions alone for successful prediction. Furthermore, the study augments the predicted classification probabilities of PSD principles with supplementary descriptive data, such as installation counts and user ratings, to predict MARS scores. Regression models, trained using these techniques, consistently outperform basic models, with feature importance scores showing the significant contribution of predicted classification probabilities of PSD principles to the models. In summary, this study suggests that automatic evaluation techniques can effectively assess the quality and user engagement of mobile health applications, offering a viable alternative to manual assessments.

TI  - BookGPT: A General Framework for Book Recommendation Empowered by Large Language Model
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - With the continuous development and change exhibited by large language model (LLM) technology, represented by generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), many classic scenarios in various fields have re-emerged with new opportunities. This paper takes ChatGPT as the modeling object, incorporates LLM technology into the typical book resource understanding and recommendation scenario for the first time, and puts it into practice. By building a ChatGPT-like book recommendation system (BookGPT) framework based on ChatGPT, this paper attempts to apply ChatGPT to recommendation modeling for three typical tasks: book rating recommendation, user rating recommendation, and the book summary recommendation; it also explores the feasibility of LLM technology in book recommendation scenarios. At the same time, based on different evaluation schemes for book recommendation tasks and the existing classic recommendation models, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the BookGPT in book recommendation scenarios and analyzes the opportunities and improvement directions for subsequent LLMs in these scenarios. The experimental research shows the following: (1) The BookGPT can achieve good recommendation results in existing classic book recommendation tasks. Especially in cases containing less information about the target object to be recommended, such as zero-shot or one-shot learning tasks, the performance of the BookGPT is close to or even better than that of the current classic book recommendation algorithms, and this method has great potential for improvement. (2) In text generation tasks such as book summary recommendation, the recommendation effect of the BookGPT model is better than that of the manual editing process of Douban Reading, and it can even perform personalized interpretable content recommendations based on readers' attribute and identity information, making it more persuasive than interpretable one-size-fits-all recommendation models. Finally, we have open-sourced the relevant datasets and experimental codes, hoping that the exploratory program proposed in this paper can inspire the development of more LLMs to expand their applications and theoretical research prospects in the field of book recommendation and general recommendation tasks.

TI  - Long-Horizon Dialogue Understanding for Role Identification in the Game of Avalon with Large Language Models
T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (EMNLP 2023)
CP  - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
AB  - Deception and persuasion play a critical role in long-horizon dialogues between multiple parties, especially when the interests, goals, and motivations of the participants are not aligned. Such complex tasks pose challenges for current Large Language Models (LLM) as deception and persuasion can easily mislead them, especially in long-horizon multi-party dialogues. To this end, we explore the game of Avalon: The Resistance, a social deduction game in which players must determine each other's hidden identities to complete their team's objective. We introduce an online testbed and a dataset containing 20 carefully collected and labeled games among human players that exhibit long-horizon deception in a cooperativecompetitive setting. We discuss the capabilities of LLMs to utilize deceptive long-horizon conversations between six human players to determine each player's goal and motivation. Particularly, we discuss the multimodal integration of the chat between the players and the game's state that grounds the conversation, providing further insights into the true player identities. We find that even current stateof-the-art LLMs do not reach human performance, making our dataset a compelling benchmark to investigate the decision-making and language-processing capabilities of LLMs. Our dataset and online testbed can be found at our project website: https://sstepput.github. io/Avalon-NLU/

TI  - Practices of Using Chatbots with Artificial Intelligence by Russian Teenagers
T2  - SOCIOLOGIA NAUKI I TEHNOLOGIJ-SOCIOLOGY OF SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The use of generative artificial intelligence is becoming widespread. Generative artificial intelligence is developing very quickly and unpredictably, so the level of risks for users is increasing. Users face algorithmic discrimination, bias, misinformation and nudges to change behavior. Teenagers are one of the most vulnerable groups who use neural network technologies in everyday life. They do not always understand the level of risks associated with new technologies, but at the same time they are often the pioneers and the most active users who are not afraid of experiment. An urgent scientific task is to study how teenagers use neural network technologies that can communicate with a person in natural language. Also of interest are adolescents' motives for using such technologies and how they evaluate possible risks. The research method is a survey of schoolchildren in grades 8-11 from two Russian regions - the Republic of Mordovia and the Donetsk People's Republic (n = 600). The study was carried out at the end of 2023 and the beginning of 2024. It is revealed that teenagers, regardless of their region of residence, generally know what chatbots with artificial intelligence are. However, those who have experience using such chatbots are mainly young men with high academic achievements, studying in grades 10-11. Neural network technologies are perceived in a utilitarian way, as assistants or advanced Internet search engines. Based on the uses and gratifications theory, it is proved that there are four main motives in the structure of teenagers using chatbots motivation. The most common motive is cognitive, and delegating, communicative and gaming motives are not so common. It is found that the benefits of using technology "here and now" outweigh the possible risks of nudging towards certain behavior. Therefore, there is a need to control how adolescents use such technologies and teach them basic user skills.

TI  - A Smartphone-Based Health Care Chatbot to Promote Self-Management of Chronic Pain (SELMA): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Ongoing pain is one of the most common diseases and has major physical, psychological, social, and economic impacts. A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC.
   Objective: The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated.
   Methods: Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data.
   Results: From May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4%) and men (14/102, 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants' comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients' own comments.
   Conclusions: SELMA is feasible, as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example, the participants' intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg, with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA.

TI  - Scaling language model size yields diminishing returns for single-message political persuasion
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Large language models can now generate political messages as persuasive as those written by humans, raising concerns about how far this persuasiveness may continue to increase with model size. Here, we generate 720 persuasive messages on 10 US political issues from 24 language models spanning several orders of magnitude in size. We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment (N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models' persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.

AB  - This paper examines the use of text message (SMS) interventions for health-related behavioral support. It first outlines thehistorical progress in SMS intervention research publications and the variety of funds from US government agencies. A narrativereview follows, highlighting the effectiveness of SMS interventions in key health areas, such as physical activity, diet and weightloss, mental health, and substance use, based on published meta-analyses. It then outlines advantages of text messaging comparedto other digital modalities, including the real-time capability to collect information and deliver microdoses of intervention support.Crucial design elements are proposed to optimize effectiveness and longitudinal engagement across communication strategies,psychological foundations, and behavior change tactics. We then discuss advanced functionalities, such as the potential forgenerative artificial intelligence to improve user interaction. Finally, major challenges to implementation are highlighted, includingthe absence of a dedicated commercial platform, privacy and security concerns with SMS technology, difficulties integratingSMS interventions with medical informatics systems, and concerns about user engagement. Proposed solutions aim to facilitatethe broader application and effectiveness of SMS interventions. Our hope is that these insights can assist researchers and practitionersin using SMS interventions to improve health outcomes and reducing disparities.

TI  - Testing theories of political persuasion using AI
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Despite its importance to society and many decades of research, key questions about the social and psychological processes of political persuasion remain unanswered, often due to data limitations. We propose that AI tools, specifically generative large language models (LLMs), can be used to address these limitations, offering important advantages in the study of political persuasion. In two preregistered online survey experiments, we demonstrate the potential of generative AI as a tool to study persuasion and provide important insights about the psychological and communicative processes that lead to increased persuasion. Specifically, we test the effects of four AI-generated counterattitudinal persuasive strategies, designed to test the effectiveness of messages that include customization (writing messages based on a receiver's personal traits and beliefs), and elaboration (increased psychological engagement with the argument through interaction). We find that all four types of persuasive AI produce significant attitude change relative to the control and shift vote support for candidates espousing views consistent with the treatments. However, we do not find evidence that message customization via microtargeting or cognitive elaboration through interaction with the AI have much more persuasive effect than a single generic message. These findings have implications for different theories of persuasion, which we discuss. Finally, we find that although persuasive messages are able to moderate some people's attitudes, they have inconsistent and weaker effects on the democratic reciprocity people grant to their political opponents. This suggests that attitude moderation (ideological depolarization) does not necessarily lead to increased democratic tolerance or decreased affective polarization.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYTEMS (CHI 2024)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Sytems (CHI)
AB  - Exposure to diverse perspectives is helpful for bursting the filter bubble in online public video platforms. The recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) illuminates the potential of creating a debate chatbot that prompts users to critically examine their stances on a topic formed by watching videos. However, whether the viewer is influenced by the chatbot may depend on its persona. In this paper, we investigated the effect of two relevant persona attributes - social identity and rhetorical styles - on critical thinking. In a mixed-methods study (n=36), we found that chatbots with outgroup (vs. ingroup) identity (t(33)=-2.33, p=0.03) and persuasive (vs. eristic) rhetoric (t(44)=1.98, p=0.05) induced critical thinking most effectively, making participants re-examine their arguments. However, participants' stances remain largely unaffected, likely due to the chatbot's lack of contextual knowledge and human touch. Our paper provides empirical groundwork for designing chatbot persona for remedying filter bubbles in online communities.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH CONFERENCE ON ACM CONVERSATIONAL USER INTERFACES, CUI 2024
CP  - 6th ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)
AB  - Regular physical activity is crucial for reducing the risk of non-communicable disease (NCD). With NCDs on the rise globally, there is an urgent need for effective health interventions, with chatbots emerging as a viable and cost-effective option because of limited healthcare accessibility. Although health professionals often utilize behavior change techniques (BCTs) to boost physical activity levels and enhance client engagement and motivation by affiliative humor, the efficacy of humor in chatbot-delivered interventions is not well-understood. This study conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the generative humorous communication style in a 10-day chatbot-delivered intervention for physical activity. It further investigated whether user engagement and motivation act as mediators between the communication style and changes in physical activity levels. 66 participants engaged with the chatbots across three groups (humorous, non-humorous, and no-intervention) and responded to daily ecological momentary assessment questionnaires assessing engagement, motivation, and physical activity levels. Multilevel time series analyses revealed that an affiliative humorous communication style positively impacted physical activity levels over time, with user engagement acting as a mediator in this relationship, whereas motivation did not. These findings clarify the role of humorous communication style in chatbot-delivered interventions for physical activity, offering valuable insights for future development of intelligent conversational agents incorporating humor.

TI  - The critical need for expert oversight of ChatGPT: Prompt engineering for safeguarding child healthcare information
T2  - JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Objective ChatGPT and other large language models have the potential to transform the health information landscape online. However, lack of domain-specific expertise and known errors in large language models raise concerns about the widespread adoption of content generated by these tools for parents making healthcare decisions for their children. The aim of this study is to determine if health-related text generated by ChatGPT under the supervision of an expert is comparable to that generated by an expert regarding persuasiveness and credibility from the perspective of a parent.Methods In a cross-sectional study 116 parents aged 18-65 years (M = 45.02, SD = 10.92) were asked to complete a baseline assessment of their behavioral intentions regarding pediatric healthcare topics. Subsequently, participants were asked to rate text generated by either an expert or by ChatGPT under supervision of an expert.Results Results indicate that prompt engineered ChatGPT is capable of impacting behavioral intentions for medication, sleep, and diet decision-making. Additionally, there was little distinction between prompt engineered ChatGPT and content experts on perceived morality, trustworthiness, expertise, accuracy, and reliance. Notably, when differences were present, prompt engineered ChatGPT was rated as higher in trustworthiness and accuracy, and participants indicated they would be more likely to rely on the information presented by prompt engineered ChatGPT compared to the expert.Discussion Given that parents will trust and rely on information generated by ChatGPT, it is critically important that human domain-specific expertise be applied to healthcare information that will ultimately be presented to consumers (e.g., parents).

TI  - Using Large Language Models to Enhance Exercise Recommendations and Physical Activity in Clinical and Healthy Populations: Scoping Review
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Regular exercise recommendations (ERs) and physical activity (PA) are crucial for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. However, creating effective exercise programs demand substantial time and specialized expertise from both medical and sports professionals. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising solution by helping create personalized ERs. While LLMs show potential, their use in exercise planning remains in its early stages and requires further exploration. Objectives: This study aims to systematically review and classify the applications of LLMs in ERs and PA. It also seeks to identify existing gaps and provide insights into future research directions for optimizing LLM integration in personalized health interventions. Methods: A scoping review methodology was used to identify studies related to LLM applications in ERs and PA. Literature searches were conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE, and arXiv for English language papers published up to March 21, 2024. Keywords included LLMs, chatbots, ERs, PA, fitness plan, and related terms. Two independent reviewers (XL and CH) screened and selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize findings, which were presented narratively. Results: An initial search identified 598 papers, of which 1.8% (11/598) of studies were included after screening and applying selection criteria. Of these, ChatGPT-based models were used in 55% (6/11) of the studies. In addition, 73% (8/11) of the studies used expert evaluations and user feedback to assess model usability, and 45% (5/11) of the studies used experimental designs to evaluate LLM interventions in ERs and PA. Key findings indicated that LLMs can generate tailored ERs, save time in clinical practice, and enhance safety by incorporating patient-specific data. They also increased engagement and supported behavior change. This made PA guidance more accessible, especially in remote or underserved communities. Conclusions: This review highlights the promising applications of LLMs in ERs and PA but emphasizes that they remain a supplement to human expertise. Expert validation is essential to ensure safety and mitigate risks. Future research should prioritize pilot testing, clinician training programs, and large-scale clinical trials to enhance feasibility, transparency, and ethical integration.

TI  - Analysis of Chinese Typical Lane Change Behavior in Car-Truck Heterogeneous Traffic Flow from UAV View
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Chinese driver behavior in heterogeneous traffic is commonly available, but it is difficult to acquire due to view limitations and sensor limitations. In this study, Chinese typical lane change behavior in car-truck heterogeneous traffic flow was collected and analyzed using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). The velocity of ego vehicle, relative velocity and distance of ego and surrounding vehicles, time to collision (TTC), time headway (THW) at the lane change moment, and brake and accelerate reaction time during lane changes were investigated. Results showed that large differences existed in various car follow types and lane change types. Cars drove more aggressively than trucks with shorter reaction times, and cars would change lanes at a longer distance when facing trucks. Smaller TTC and THW were found for trucks when facing cars. Chinese drivers showed more frequent lane-change maneuvers and shorter reaction times compared to other countries. The driver characteristic in China provided data support for the training of artificial intelligence-based decision algorithms, the development of a localized system, and the design of roads.

Current clinical practice guidelines recommend that providers augment the longitudinal care of people living with obesity with consistent support for the development of self-efficacy and motivation to modify their lifestyle behaviors. Lifestyle behavior change aligns with the goals of motivational interviewing (MI), a client-centered yet directive counseling modality. However, training health care providers to be proficient in MI is expensive and time-consuming, resulting in a lack of trained counselors and limiting the widespread adoption of MI in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) counselors accessible via the internet can help circumvent these barriers. Objective: The primary objective is to explore the feasibility of conducting unscripted MI-consistent counseling using Neural Agent for Obesity Motivational Interviewing (NAOMI), a large language model (LLM)-based web app for weight loss counseling. The secondary objectives are to test the acceptability and usability of NAOMI's counseling and examine its ability to shift motivational precursors in a sample of patients with overweight and obesity recruited from primary care clinics. Methods: NAOMI will be developed based on recent advances in deep learning in four stages. In stages 1 and 2, NAOMI will be implemented using an open-source foundation LLM and (1) few-shot learning based on a prompt with task-specific instructions and (2) domain adaptation strategy based on fine-tuning LLM using a large corpus of general psychotherapy and MI treatment transcripts. In stages 3 and 4, we will refine the best of these 2 approaches. Each NAOMI version will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach in which 10 adults (18-65 years) meeting the criteria for overweight or obesity (25.0 >= BMI <= 39.9) interact with NAOMI and provide feedback. NAOMI's fidelity to the MI framework will be assessed using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity scale. Participants' general perceptions of AI conversational agents and NAOMI specifically will be assessed via Pre- and Post-Interaction Questionnaires. Motivational precursors, such as participants' confidence, importance, and readiness for changing lifestyle behaviors (eg, diet and activity), will be measured before and after the interaction, and 1 week later. A qualitative analysis of changes in the measures of perceptions of AI agents and counselors and motivational precursors will be performed. Participants will rate NAOMI's usability and empathic skills post interaction via questionnaire-based assessments along with providing feedback about their experience with NAOMI via a qualitative interview. Results: NAOMI (version 1.0) has been developed. Participant recruitment will commence in September 2024. Data collection activities are expected to conclude in May 2025. Conclusions: If proven effective, LLM-based counseling agents can become a cost-effective approach for addressing the obesity epidemic at a public health level. They can also have a broad, transformative impact on the delivery of MI and other psychotherapeutic treatment modalities extending their reach and broadening access.

TI  - Can LLMs Reason Like Humans? Assessing Theory of Mind Reasoning in LLMs for Open-Ended Questions
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 33RD ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, CIKM 2024
CP  - 33rd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)
AB  - Theory of mind (ToM) reasoning involves understanding that others have intentions, emotions, and thoughts, which is crucial for regulating one's reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation, they still face challenges with ToM reasoning, especially in open-ended questions. Despite advancements, the extent to which LLMs truly understand ToM reasoning and how closely it aligns with human ToM reasoning remains inadequately explored in openended scenarios. Motivated by this gap, we assess the abilities of LLMs to perceive and integrate human intentions and emotions into their ToM reasoning processes within open-ended questions. Our study utilizes posts from Reddit's ChangeMyView platform, which demands nuanced social reasoning to craft persuasive responses. Our analysis, comparing semantic similarity and lexical overlap metrics between responses generated by humans and LLMs, reveals clear disparities in ToM reasoning capabilities in open-ended questions, with even the most advanced models showing notable limitations. To enhance LLM capabilities, we implement a prompt tuning method that incorporates human intentions and emotions, resulting in improvements in ToM reasoning performance. However, despite these improvements, the enhancement still falls short of fully achieving human-like reasoning. This research highlights the deficiencies in LLMs' social reasoning and demonstrates how integrating human intentions and emotions can boost their effectiveness.

TI  - Laypeople's Use of and Attitudes Toward Large Language Models and Search Engines for Health Queries: Survey Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Laypeople have easy access to health information through large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and search engines, such as Google. Search engines transformed health information access, and LLMs offer a new avenuefor answering laypeople's questions. Objective: We aimed to comparethefrequency of use and attitudes toward LLMsand search engines as well as their comparative relevance, usefulness, ease of use, and trustworthiness in responding to health queries. Methods: We conducted a screening survey to comparethe demographics of LLM users and nonusers seeking health information, analyzing results with logistic regression. LLM users from the screening survey were invited to a follow-up survey to report the types of health information they sought. We compared the frequency of use of LLMs and search engines using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. Lastly, paired-sample Wilcoxon tests compared LLMsand search engines on perceived usefulness, ease of use, trustworthiness, feelings, bias, and anthropomorphism. Results: In total, 2002 US participants recruited on Prolific participated in the screening survey about the use of LLMs and search engines. Of them, 52% (n=1045) of the participants were female, with a mean age of 39 (SD 13) years. Participants were 9.7% (n=194) Asian, 12.1% (n=242) Black, 73.3% (n=1467) White, 1.1% (n=22) Hispanic, and 3.8% (n=77) were of other races and ethnicities. Further, 1913 (95.6%) used search engines to look up health queriesversus 642 (32.6%) for LLMs. Men had higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.34-1.99; P<.001) of using LLMsfor health questionsthan women. Black (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.42-2.54; P<.001) and Asian (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.19-2.30; P<.01) individuals had higher odds than White individuals. Those with excellent perceived health (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1-1.93; P=.01) were more likely to use LLMs than those with good health. Higher technical proficiency increased the likelihood of LLM use (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.39; P<.001). In a follow-up survey of 281 LLM users for health, most participants used search engines first (n=174, 62%) to answer health questions, but the second most common first source consulted was LLMs (n=39, 14%). LLMs were perceived as less useful (P<.01) and less relevant (P=.07), but elicited fewer negative feelings (P<.001), appeared more human (LLM: n=160, vs search: n=32), and were seen as less biased (P<.001). Trust (P=.56) and easeof use (P=.27) showed no differences. Conclusions: Search engines are the primary source of health information; yet, positive perceptions of LLMs suggest growing use. Future work could explore whether LLM trust and usefulness are enhanced by supplementing answers with external references and limiting persuasive language to curb overreliance. Collaboration with health organizations can help improve the quality of LLMs' health output.

TI  - Coaching Copilot: Blended Form of an LLM-Powered Chatbot and a Human Coach to Effectively Support Self-Reflection for Leadership Growth
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH CONFERENCE ON ACM CONVERSATIONAL USER INTERFACES, CUI 2024
CP  - 6th ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)
AB  - Chatbots' role in fostering self-reflection is now widely recognized, especially in inducing users' behavior change. While the benefits of 24/7 availability, scalability, and consistent responses have been demonstrated in contexts such as healthcare and tutoring to help one form a new habit, their utilization in coaching necessitating deeper introspective dialogue to induce leadership growth remains unexplored. This paper explores the potential of such a chatbot powered by recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaboration with professional coaches in the field of executive coaching. Through a design workshop with them and two weeks of user study involving ten coach-client pairs, we explored the feasibility and nuances of integrating chatbots to complement human coaches. Our findings highlight the benefits of chatbots' ubiquity and reasoning capabilities enabled by LLMs while identifying their limitations and design necessities for effective collaboration between human coaches and chatbots. By doing so, thiswork contributes to the foundation for augmenting one's self-reflective process with prevalent conversational agents through the human-in-the-loop approach.

TI  - Conceptualizing generative AI as style engines: Application archetypes and implications
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB  - The rise of generative AI has brought with it a surprising paradox: systems that excel at tasks once thought to be uniquely human, like fluent conversation or persuasive writing, while simultaneously failing to meet traditional expectations of computing, in terms of reliability, accuracy, and veracity (e.g., given the various issues with socalled 'hallucinations'). We argue that, when generative AI is seen through a traditional computing lens, its development focuses on optimizing for traditional computing traits that remain in principle unattainable. This risks backgrounding what is most novel and defining about it. As probabilistic technologies, generative AIs do not store, in any traditional sense, any data or content. Rather, essential features of training data become encoded in deep neural networks as patterns, that become practically available as styles. We discuss what happens when the distinction between objects and their appearance dissolves and all aspects of images or text become understood as styles, accessible for exploration and creative combination and generation. For example, defining visual qualities of entities like 'chair' or 'cat' become available as 'chair-ness' or 'cat-ness' for creative image generation. We argue that, when understood as style engines, unique generative AI capabilities become conceptualized as complementing traditional computing ones. This will aid both computing practitioners and information systems researchers in reconciling and integrating generative AI into the traditional IS landscape. Our conceptualization leads us to propose four archetypes of generative AI application and use, and to highlight future avenues for information systems research made visible by this conceptualization, as well as implications for practice and policymaking.

TI  - Rethinking Environmental Disclosure
T2  - CALIFORNIA LAW REVIEW
AB  - Twenty years ago, legal scholars and regulators alike were convinced that information-forcing regulations heralded a new era in environmental law. Coming off the success of the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI), which seemed to decrease toxic chemical pollution solely by forcing industry to disclose if they released certain chemicals, many called information regulation the third wave of environmental law. New information disclosure policies were enacted and old policies reinvigorated, leading to a plethora of informationbased regulations throughout environmental law. Now, twenty years later, the emergence of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to environmental analysis have only further increased the belief in the benefits of information-forcing approaches. In this time, the central premise that information regulation works to change behavior and improve environmental outcomes has been largely unquestioned. Despite the widespread enthusiasm, after decades of implementation it is increasingly clear that information regulation largely fails to achieve its environmental goals. This Article makes two main contributions. By drawing on quantitative and qualitative case studies of information-forcing regulations, it first answers the question of whether this approach to environmental regulation is effective. It evaluates the success of information-forcing policies, finding that these policies often fail both to change behavior towards improving environmental conditions and to achieve other stated goals. This Article then analyzes the mechanisms behind information forcing in conjunction with these case studies to propose characteristics that determine the success, or failure, of information regulation. It finds that contrary to popular belief, persuasive and economic mechanisms not drive environmental behavior change. Instead, information- forcing regulations with legal mechanisms of action show the most promise and efficacy. Moving beyond sweeping promises of efficiency and transparency to understand the specific characteristics that make these programs successful is essential moving forward into an era of big environmental data.

TI  - 11th Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems (IntRS'24)
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE EIGHTEENTH ACM CONFERENCE ON RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS, RECSYS 2024
CP  - 18h ACM Conference on Recommender Systems (RecSys)
AB  - The primary goal of Recommender Systems is to suggest the most suitable items to a user, aligning them with the user's interests and needs. RSs are essential for modern e-commerce, helping users discover content and products by predicting suitable items based on their past behavior. However, their success isn't just about advanced algorithms. The design of the user interface and a good integration with the human decision-making process are equally crucial. A well-designed interface enhances the user experience and makes recommendations more effective, while a poor interface can lead to frustration. Recognizing this limitation, recent trends in Recommender Systems (RSs) are increasingly focusing on integrating Symbiotic Human-Machine Decision-Making models. These models aim to offer users a dynamic and persuasive interface that helps them better understand and engage with recommendations. This shift is a crucial step toward developing recommender systems that truly connect with users and offer a more enjoyable, trustworthy, explainable, and user-friendly experience. Although early efforts concentrated on creating systems that could proactively predict user preferences and needs, modern RSs also emphasize the importance of providing users with control and transparency over their recommendations. Finding the right balance between proactivity and user control is essential to ensure that the system supports users without being too intrusive, thus improving their overall satisfaction. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into recommender systems, the importance of user-centric interfaces and a deep understanding of decision-making becomes even more critical. Effective integration of LLMs requires interfaces that are both visually and cognitively engaging.
   These aspects are the main discussion topics of the Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems at RecSys'24. In this summary, we introduce the motivation and perspective of the workshop, review its history, and discuss the most critical issues that deserve attention for future research directions.

TI  - Leveraging LLMs for LLM-Generated Fake News Detection: Insights from COVID-19 Misinformation
T2  - 2024 IEEE 16TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS, CICN
CP  - 16th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Communication Networks
AB  - The rapid spread of misinformation on social media, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, underscores the urgent need for effective detection systems. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for combating misinformation due to their extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. However, LLMs also present challenges to misinformation detection systems, as they can be misused to generate highly persuasive disinformation. This study investigates the dual role of LLMs as both generators and evaluators of fake news, focusing on four models: GPT-3.5, GPT4, Gemini, and Claude. We evaluate their ability to detect fake news within mixed datasets of real and fake news, generated by LLMs. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of modern LLMs in identifying misinformation in short-form contexts, offering valuable insights into mitigating the spread of fake news.

TI  - Imitation of Real Lane-Change Decisions Using Reinforcement Learning
T2  - IFAC PAPERSONLINE
CP  - 16th IFAC Symposium on Control in Transportation Systems (CTS)
AB  - Microscopic modeling of human driving consists generally in combining both carfollowing and lane-change models. While the human car-following process has been extensively developed and well modeled, the lane-change behavior is more complex to understand and still remains to be explored. Classical lane-change models are usually rule-based and handcrafted, that tend to exhibit limited performance. Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) ones, provide an alternative approach and have recently achieved high success in modeling difficult decision-making processes in many fields. We propose in this article a reinforcement learning based model for the human lane-change behavior, with an online calibration of real lane-change decisions, extracted from the NGSIM data-set. In addition, we use the traffic vehicular simulator SUMO ("Simulation of Urban MObility") to create a numerical simulation environment. The utilization of numerical traffic simulation allows us enriching the data-set, for training the agent to find an optimal policy for lane change. Thus, about 13% additional traffic situations, not present in the real data, are created by the traffic simulation environment. The trained agent is collision-free and human-like who is satisfactory to real data and also to the additional simulated data. Moreover, our RL model can perform up to 95.37% of the real decisions observed in the data-set. Copyright (C) 2021 The Authors.

TI  - Behavioral Nudging With Generative AI for Content Development in SMS Health Care Interventions: Case Study
T2  - JMIR AI
AB  - Background: Brief message interventions have demonstrated immense promise in health care, yet the development of these messages has suffered from a dearth of transparency and a scarcity of publicly accessible data sets. Moreover, the researcher-driven content creation process has raised resource allocation issues, necessitating a more efficient and transparent approach to content development. Objective: This research sets out to address the challenges of content development for SMS interventions by showcasing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for content creation, transparently explaining the prompt design and content generation process, and providing the largest publicly available data set of brief messages and source code for future replication of our process. Methods: Leveraging the pretrained large language model GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), we generate a collection of messages in the context of medication adherencefor individuals with type 2 diabetes using evidence-derived behavior changetechniques identified in a prior systematic review. We create an attributed prompt designed to adhere to content (readability and tone) and SMS (character count and encoder type) standards while encouraging message variability to reflect differences in behavior change techniques. Results: We deliver the most extensive repository of brief messages for a singular health care intervention and the first library of messages crafted with generative AI. In total, our method yields a data set comprising 1150 messages, with 89.91% (n=1034) meeting character length requirements and 80.7% (n=928) meeting readability requirements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that all messages exhibit diversity comparable to an existing publicly available data set created under the same theoretical framework for a similar setting. Conclusions: This research provides a novel approach to content creation for health care interventions using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. Future research is needed to assess the generated content for ethical, safety, and research standards, as well as to determine whether the intervention is successful in improving the target behaviors.

TI  - Predicting reward-based crowdfunding success with multimodal data: A theory-guided framework
T2  - INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT
AB  - There is a growing need to investigate the impact of multimodal data, which are becoming increasingly prevalent on crowdfunding platforms, on prediction of fundraising outcomes. However, a prediction framework drawing upon rational theoretical foundations to leverage multimodal data in crowdfunding is still lacking. Guided by relevant theories, we explore the ideational, interpersonal, and textual metafunctions of multimodal data geared toward fundraising success prediction. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates superior predictive utilities of various metafunction-based multimodal features over purely data-driven ones. Our results also reveal that the multiple data modalities interact complementarily and synergistically to improve the prediction performance. Specifically, combining metafunctions improved prediction performance by 2-15 % over a single metafunction, while multimodality outperformed single data modality by 7-18 % within each metafunction.

TI  - The impact of selfish driving behavior of autonomous vehicles on mixed traffic flow
T2  - PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS
AB  - With the development of automatic control and artificial intelligence technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming more and more intelligent. However, this individual intelligence means that the driving behavior of AVs can be more aggressive and selfish. To investigate the impact of the selfish driving behavior of AVs on the characteristics of mixed traffic flow, this paper proposes a cellular automata model that considers the selfish driving behavior of AVs. First, we analyze the vehicle types in the current mixed traffic flow and develop a universal safety distance model. Then, based on this, a cellular automata model is proposed. This model can not only describe the longitudinal car-following and lateral lane-changing behavior of human-driven vehicles and AVs, but also characterize the selfish degree in the driving behavior of AVs. Finally, simulation experiments are designed to analyze the impact of the selfish driving behavior of AVs on the performance indicators of mixed traffic flow. The results show that: (1) The increase in the penetration rate of AVs has a positive effect on the average velocity, traffic stability, and throughput of mixed traffic flow; (2) On the whole, the selfish lane-changing behavior of AVs has a relatively small impact on the average velocity of mixed traffic flow. The impact becomes smaller with the increase in traffic density. (3) In most scenarios, the selfish car-following behavior of AVs has an improving effect on the average velocity and throughput of mixed traffic flow. In summary, the relevant research results can provide theoretical support for the design of micro-behavioral control schemes for AVs.

T2  - COMPANION PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2025 CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES, IUI 2025
CP  - 30th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces-IUI
AB  - Group decision-making often benefits from diverse perspectives, yet power imbalances and social influence can stifle minority opinions and compromise outcomes. This prequel introduces an AI-mediated communication system that leverages the Large Language Model to serve as a devil's advocate, representing underrepresented viewpoints without exposing minority members' identities. Rooted in persuasive communication strategies and anonymity, the system aims to improve psychological safety and foster more inclusive decision-making. Our multi-agent architecture, which consists of a summary agent, conversation agent, AI duplicate checker, and paraphrase agent, encourages the group's critical thinking while reducing repetitive outputs. We acknowledge that reliance on text-based communication and fixed intervention timings may limit adaptability, indicating pathways for refinement. By focusing on the representation of minority viewpoints anonymously in power-imbalanced settings, this approach highlights how AI-driven methods can evolve to support more divergent and inclusive group decision-making.

TI  - LMEME at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Teacher Student Fusion - Integrating CLIP with LLMs for Enhanced Persuasion Detection
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC EVALUATION, SEMEVAL-2024
CP  - 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)
AB  - This paper describes our system used in the SemEval-2024 Task 4 Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Memes. Our team proposes a detection system that employs a Teacher Student Fusion framework. Initially, a Large Language Model serves as the teacher, engaging in abductive reasoning on multimodal inputs to generate background knowledge on persuasion techniques, assisting in the training of a smaller downstream model. The student model adopts CLIP as an encoder for text and image features, and we incorporate an attention mechanism for modality alignment. Ultimately, our proposed system achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.8103, ranking 1st out of 20 on the leaderboard of Subtask 2b in English. In Bulgarian, Macedonian and Arabic, our detection capabilities are ranked 1/15, 3/15 and 14/15.

TI  - The Earth is Flat because...: Investigating LLMs' Belief towards Misinformation via Persuasive Conversation Ethical Disclaimer: May Contain Misinformation in the Following Content
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one. Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies.

TI  - Unlocking the power of multimodal online reviews: A multisensory perspective
T2  - TOURISM MANAGEMENT
AB  - Multimodal online reviews have been an essential marketing tool for dominating consumer perception. However, the precise impact of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory cues in multimodal content on consumers' perceived review usefulness remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how text and image contents affect review usefulness from a multisensory perspective. To this end, we proposed a framework that combined machine learning and multimodal large language models to quantify the multisensory elements conveyed through review text and images. Based on the Poisson regression model, the estimation results show that while multisensory elements in text and images have a generally consistent impact on consumer perception, each sensory element carries distinct value. Furthermore, the sensory discrepancy in text and images has a negative effect on the perceived review usefulness. Our findings contribute theoretically to enhancing review persuasion effect and sensory marketing literature.

TI  - Decomposing Argumentative Essay Generation via Dialectical Planning of Complex Reasoning
T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: ACL 2024
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - Argumentative Essay Generation (AEG) is a challenging task in computational argumentation, where detailed logical reasoning and effective rhetorical skills are essential. Previous methods on argument generation typically involve planning prior to generation. However, the planning strategies in these methods overlook the exploration of the logical reasoning process. Inspired by argument structure-related theories, we propose an argumentative planning strategy for prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality essays. This strategy comprises two stages: (1) Sketch planning, which creates a rough outline of the essay, and (2) Dialectical planning, which refines the outline through critical self-reflection. Such a planning strategy enables LLMs to write argumentative essays that are more logical, diverse, and persuasive. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of existing AEG datasets, we construct three new datasets. These datasets are from two domains: exam essays and news editorials, covering both Chinese and English. Automatic and manual evaluation on four datasets show that our method can generate more dialectical and persuasive essays with higher diversity compared to several strong baselines1.

TI  - Confronting Core Issues: A Critical Assessment of Attitude Polarization Using Tailored Experiments
T2  - AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
AB  - A long-standing debate in political psychology considers whether individuals update their beliefs and attitudes in the direction of evidence or grow more confident in their convictions when confronted with counter-attitudinal arguments. Though recent studies have shown that instances of the latter tendency, which scholars have termed attitude polarization and "belief backfire," are rarely observed in settings involving hot-button issues or viral misinformation, we know surprisingly little about how participants respond to information targeting deeply held attitudes, a key condition for triggering attitude polarization. We develop a tailored experimental design that measures participants' core issue positions and exposes them to personalized counter-attitudinal information using the large language model GPT-3. We find credible evidence of attitude polarization, but only when arguments are contentious and vitriolic. For lower valence counter-attitudinal arguments, attitude polarization is not detected. We conclude by discussing implications for the study of political cognition and the measurement of attitudes.

TI  - The persuasive effects of political microtargeting in the age of generative artificial intelligence
T2  - PNAS NEXUS
AB  - The increasing availability of microtargeted advertising and the accessibility of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have raised concerns about the potential misuse of large language models in scaling microtargeting efforts for political purposes. Recent technological advancements, involving generative AI and personality inference from consumed text, can potentially create a highly scalable "manipulation machine" that targets individuals based on their unique vulnerabilities without requiring human input. This paper presents four studies examining the effectiveness of this putative "manipulation machine." The results demonstrate that personalized political ads tailored to individuals' personalities are more effective than nonpersonalized ads (studies 1a and 1b). Additionally, we showcase the feasibility of automatically generating and validating these personalized ads on a large scale (studies 2a and 2b). These findings highlight the potential risks of utilizing AI and microtargeting to craft political messages that resonate with individuals based on their personality traits. This should be an area of concern to ethicists and policy makers.

T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Public health messaging is crucial for promoting beneficial health outcomes, and the latest advancements in artificial intelligence offer new opportunities in this field. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4 in generating pro-vaccine messages on different topics for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination.Methods In this study (N = 60), we examined the persuasive effect of pro-vaccine messages generated by GPT-4 and humans, which were constructed based on 17 factors impacting HPV vaccination. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare the persuasiveness of these messages.Results GPT-generated messages were reported as more persuasive than human-generated messages on some influencing factors (e.g., untoward effect, stigmatized perception). Human-generated messages performed better on the message regarding convenience of vaccination.Discussion This study provides evidence for the viability of ChatGPT, in generating persuasive pro-vaccine messages to influence people's vaccine attitudes. It is indicated that the feasibility and efficiency of using AI for public health communication.

T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Early work has found that large language models (LLMs) can generate persuasive content. However, evidence on whether they can also personalize arguments to individual attributes remains limited, despite being crucial for assessing misuse. This preregistered study examines AI-driven persuasion in a controlled setting, where participants engaged in short multiround debates. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 conditions in a 2 x 2 x 3 design: (1) human or GPT-4 debate opponent; (2) opponent with or without access to sociodemographic participant data; (3) debate topic of low, medium or high opinion strength. In debate pairs where AI and humans were not equally persuasive, GPT-4 with personalization was more persuasive 64.4% of the time (81.2% relative increase in odds of higher post-debate agreement; 95% confidence interval [+26.0%, +160.7%], P < 0.01; N = 900). Our findings highlight the power of LLM-based persuasion and have implications for the governance and design of online platforms.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 36TH ANNUAL ACM SYMPOSIUM ON USER INTERFACE SOFTWARE AND TECHNOLOGY, UIST 2023
CP  - 36th Annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology (UIST)
AB  - In argumentative writing, writers must brainstorm hierarchical writing goals, ensure the persuasiveness of their arguments, and revise and organize their plans through drafting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping. A controlled lab study confrmed the usability and efectiveness of VISAR in facilitating the argumentative writing planning process.

T2  - 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, EMNLP 2023
CP  - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
AB  - Planning for goal-oriented dialogue often requires simulating future dialogue interactions and estimating task progress. Many approaches thus consider training neural networks to perform look-ahead search algorithms such as A* search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, this training often requires abundant annotated data, which creates challenges when faced with noisy annotations or low-resource settings. We introduce GDP- ZERO, an approach using Open-Loop MCTS to perform goal-oriented dialogue policy planning without any model training. GDP-ZERO prompts a large language model to act as a policy prior, value function, user simulator, and system model during the tree search. We evaluate GDP- ZERO on the goal-oriented task PersuasionForGood, and find that its responses are preferred over ChatGPT up to 59.32% of the time, and are rated more persuasive than Chat-GPT during interactive evaluations(1).

TI  - Does ChatGPT Write Like a Student? Engagement Markers in Argumentative Essays
T2  - WRITTEN COMMUNICATION
AB  - ChatGPT has created considerable anxiety among teachers concerned that students might turn to large language models (LLMs) to write their assignments. Many of these models are able to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts, thus potentially enabling cheating and undermining literacy and critical thinking skills. This study seeks to explore the extent LLMs can mimic human-produced texts by comparing essays by ChatGPT and student writers. By analyzing 145 essays from each group, we focus on the way writers relate to their readers with respect to the positions they advance in their texts by examining the frequency and types of engagement markers. The findings reveal that student essays are significantly richer in the quantity and variety of engagement features, producing a more interactive and persuasive discourse. The ChatGPT-generated essays exhibited fewer engagement markers, particularly questions and personal asides, indicating its limitations in building interactional arguments. We attribute the patterns in ChatGPT's output to the language data used to train the model and its underlying statistical algorithms. The study suggests a number of pedagogical implications for incorporating ChatGPT in writing instruction.

TI  - Which AI doctor would you like to see? Emulating healthcare provider-patient communication models with GPT-4: proof-of-concept and ethical exploration
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ETHICS
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in enhancing various aspects of healthcare, including health provider-patient communication. However, some have raised the concern that such communication may adopt implicit communication norms that deviate from what patients want or need from talking with their healthcare provider. This paper explores the possibility of using LLMs to enable patients to choose their preferred communication style when discussing their medical cases. By providing a proof-of-concept demonstration using ChatGPT-4, we suggest LLMs can emulate different healthcare provider-patient communication approaches (building on Emanuel and Emanuel's four models: paternalistic, informative, interpretive and deliberative). This allows patients to engage in a communication style that aligns with their individual needs and preferences. We also highlight potential risks associated with using LLMs in healthcare communication, such as reinforcing patients' biases and the persuasive capabilities of LLMs that may lead to unintended manipulation.

CP  - 32nd ACM Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization (ACM UMAP)
AB  - News media framing can shape public perception and potentially polarize views. Emotional language can exacerbate these framing effects, as a user's emotional state can be an important contextual factor to use in news recommendation. Our research explores the relation between emotional framing techniques and the emotional states of readers, as well as readers' perceived trust in specific news articles. Users (N = 200) had to read three economic news articles from the Washington Post. We used ChatGPT-4 to reframe news articles with specific emotional languages (Anger, Fear, Hope), compared to a neutral baseline reframed by a human journalist. Our results revealed that negative framing (Anger, Fear) elicited stronger negative emotional states among users than the neutral baseline, while Hope led to little changes overall. In contrast, perceived trust levels varied little across the different conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings and how emotional framing could affect societal polarization issues.

T2  - 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (EMNLP 2023)
CP  - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
AB  - Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. There is a dearth of large annotated training datasets in the multimedia domain hindering the development of supervised learning models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. On the other hand, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question-answering, and topic classification. To leverage such advanced techniques to bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing long videos to generate their descriptions in natural language, followed by performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on fifteen video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised baselines for video understanding. Furthermore, to alleviate a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science on persuasion strategy identification.

TI  - Enrichment of Turkish question answering systems using knowledge graphs
T2  - TURKISH JOURNAL OF ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCES
AB  - Recent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have transformed many tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including question answering. The state-of-the-art systems do an excellent job of responding in a relevant, persuasive way but cannot guarantee factuality. Knowledge graphs, representing facts as triplets, can be valuable for avoiding errors and inconsistencies with real-world facts. This work introduces a knowledge graph-based approach to Turkish question answering. The proposed approach aims to develop a methodology capable of drawing inferences from a knowledge graph to answer complex multihop questions. We construct the Beyazperde Movie Knowledge Graph (BPMovieKG) and the Turkish Movie Question Answering dataset (TRMQA) to answer questions in the movie domain. We evaluate our proposed question answering pipeline against a baseline study. Furthermore, we compare it with a question answering system built upon GPT-3.5 Turbo to answer the 1-hop questions from TRMQA. The experimental results confirm that link prediction on a knowledge graph is quite effective in answering questions that require reasoning paths. Finally, we provide insights into the pros and cons of the provided solution through a qualitative study.

TI  - Perceiving AI intervention does not compromise the persuasive effect of fact-checking
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB  - Efforts to scale up fact-checking through technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly being suggested and tested. This study examines whether previously observed effects of reading fact-checks remain constant when readers are aware of AI's involvement in the fact-checking process. We conducted three online experiments (N = 3,978), exposing participants to fact-checks identified as either human-generated or AI-assisted, simulating cases where AI fully generates the fact-check or automatically retrieves human fact-checks. Our findings indicate that the persuasive effect of fact-checking, specifically in increasing truth discernment, persists even among participants without a positive prior attitude toward AI. Additionally, in some cases, awareness of AI's role reduced perceived political bias in fact-checks among Republicans. Finally, neither AI-generated nor human fact-checks significantly affected participants' feelings toward or their perceptions of the competence of the targeted politicians.

AB  - Amidst the increasingly prevalent smartphone addiction, we introduce StayFocused, a mobile app to help people focus on their tasks at hand by reducing compulsive smartphone use. Besides guiding people to set focus sessions for non-screen time, we incorporated reflective prompts probing individuals' phone-checking intentions whenever they check their phones and a chatbot to deliver these prompts. To examine the effects of the refective prompts and the chatbot support, we designed three versions of StayFocused: baseline, reflection, and reflection-chatbot, and conducted a stage-based between-subjects study with 36 college students over five weeks. We found that participants who received the reflective prompts were able to focus longer and resist distractions, and those with chatbot support seemed to better maintain their smartphone use reduction. By highlighting how participants reflected on their focus session activities and their preferences for the chatbot, we discuss the implications of designing persuasive conversational interfaces to reduce unintended behaviors.

TI  - Using Health Chatbots for Behavior Change: A Mapping Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB  - This study conducts a mapping study to survey the landscape of health chatbots along three research questions: What illnesses are chatbots tackling? What patient competences are chatbots aimed at? Which chatbot technical enablers are of most interest in the health domain? We identify 30 articles related to health chatbots from 2014 to 2018. We analyze the selected articles qualitatively and extract a triplet <technicalEnablers, competence, illness> for each of them. This data serves to provide a first overview of chatbot-mediated behavior change on the health domain. Main insights include: nutritional disorders and neurological disorders as the main illness areas being tackled; affect as the human competence most pursued by chatbots to attain change behavior; and personalization and consumability as the most appreciated technical enablers. On the other hand, main limitations include lack of adherence to good practices to case-study reporting, and a deeper look at the broader sociological implications brought by this technology.

TI  - Evaluating GPT-3 Generated Explanations for Hateful Content Moderation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE THIRTY-SECOND INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, IJCAI 2023
CP  - 32nd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI)
AB  - Recent research has focused on using large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for hate speech through fine-tuning or prompting. Despite the growing interest in this area, these generated explanations' effectiveness and potential limitations remain poorly understood. A key concern is that these explanations, generated by LLMs, may lead to erroneous judgments about the nature of flagged content by both users and content moderators. For instance, an LLM-generated explanation might inaccurately convince a content moderator that a benign piece of content is hateful. In light of this, we propose an analytical framework for examining hate speech explanations and conducted an extensive survey on evaluating such explanations. Specifically, we prompted GPT-3 to generate explanations for both hateful and non-hateful content, and a survey was conducted with 2,400 unique respondents to evaluate the generated explanations. Our findings reveal that (1) human evaluators rated the GPT-generated explanations as high quality in terms of linguistic fluency, informativeness, persuasiveness, and logical soundness, (2) the persuasive nature of these explanations, however, varied depending on the prompting strategy employed, and (3) this persuasiveness may result in incorrect judgments about the hatefulness of the content. Our study underscores the need for caution in applying LLM-generated explanations for content moderation. Code and results are available at https://github.com/Social-AI-Studio/GPT3-HateEval.

TI  - Snarci at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Themis Model for Binary Classification of Memes
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC EVALUATION, SEMEVAL-2024
CP  - 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)
AB  - This paper introduces an approach developed for multimodal meme analysis, specifically targeting the identification of persuasion techniques embedded within memes. Our methodology integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning image encoders to discern the presence of persuasive elements in memes across diverse platforms. By capitalizing on the contextual understanding facilitated by LLMs and the discriminative power of contrastive learning for image encoding, our framework provides a robust solution for detecting and classifying memes with persuasion techniques. The system was used in Task 4 of Semeval 2024, precisely for Substask 2b (binary classification of presence of persuasion techniques). It showed promising results overall, achieving a Macro-F-1 = 0.7986 on the English test data (i.e., the language the system was trained on) and Macro-F-1 = 0.66777/0.47917/0.5554, respectively, on the other three "surprise" languages proposed by the task organizers, i.e., Bulgarian, North Macedonian and Arabic. The paper provides an overview of the system, along with a discussion of the results obtained and its main limitations.

TI  - The Wildcard XAI: from a Necessity, to a Resource, to a Dangerous Decoy
T2  - EXPLAINABLE AND TRANSPARENT AI AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS, EXTRAAMAS 2024
CP  - 6th International Workshop on Explainable and Transparent AI and Multi-Agent Systems (EXTRAAMAS)
AB  - There has been a growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (henceforth XAI) models among researchers and AI programmers in recent years. Indeed, the development of highly interactive technologies that can collaborate closely with users has made explainability a necessity. This intends to reduce mistrust and the sense of unpredictability that AI can create, especially among non-experts. Moreover, the potential of XAI as a valuable resource has been recognized, considering that it can make intelligent systems more user-friendly and reduce the negative impact of black box systems. Building on such considerations, the paper discusses the potential dangers of large language models (LLMs) that generate explanations to support the outcomes produced. While these models may give users the illusion of control over the system's responses, they actually have persuasive and non-explanatory effects. Therefore, it is argued here that XAI, appropriately regulated, should be a resource to empower users of AI systems. Any other apparent explanations should be reported to avoid misleading and circumventing effects.

TI  - The potential of generative AI for personalized persuasion at scale
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Matching the language or content of a message to the psychological profile of its recipient (known as "personalized persuasion") is widely considered to be one of the most effective messaging strategies. We demonstrate that the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, could accelerate this influence by making personalized persuasion scalable. Across four studies (consisting of seven sub-studies; total N = 1788), we show that personalized messages crafted by ChatGPT exhibit significantly more influence than non-personalized messages. This was true across different domains of persuasion (e.g., marketing of consumer products, political appeals for climate action), psychological profiles (e.g., personality traits, political ideology, moral foundations), and when only providing the LLM with a single, short prompt naming or describing the targeted psychological dimension. Thus, our findings are among the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to automate, and thereby scale, the use of personalized persuasion in ways that enhance its effectiveness and efficiency. We discuss the implications for researchers, practitioners, and the general public.

TI  - Metadiscursive nouns in academic argument: ChatGPT vs student practices
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC PURPOSES
AB  - The ability of ChatGPT to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts has generated considerable anxiety among those concerned that students might use such large language models (LLMs) to write their assignments. The extent to which LLMs can mimic human writers is starting to be explored, but we know little about their ability to use nominal resources to create effective academic texts. This study investigates metadiscursive nouns in argumentative essays, comparing how ChatGPT and university students employ these devices to organise text, express stance, and construct persuasive arguments. By analysing 145 essays from each source, we examine the syntactic patterns, interactive functions, and interactional uses of metadiscursive nouns. The analysis reveals that while overall frequencies were similar, ChatGPT has distinct preferences for simpler syntactic constructions (particularly the determiner + N pattern) and relies heavily on anaphoric references, whereas students demonstrate more balanced syntactic distribution and greater use of cataphoric references. Interactionally, ChatGPT prefers manner nouns for descriptive precision, while students favour status nouns for evaluative reasoning and evidential nouns for empirical grounding. These findings show that, while structurally coherent, LLMgenerated texts often lack the rhetorical flexibility and evaluative sophistication of human academic writing, offering valuable insights for EAP pedagogy.

TI  - UMUTeam at SemEval-2024 Task 4: Multimodal Identification of Persuasive Techniques in Memes through Large Language Models
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC EVALUATION, SEMEVAL-2024
CP  - 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)
AB  - In this manuscript we describe the UMUTeam's participation in SemEval-2024 Task 4, a shared task to identify different persuasion techniques in memes. The task is divided into three subtasks. One is a multimodal subtask of identifying whether a meme contains persuasion or not. The others are hierarchical multi-label classifications that consider textual content alone or a multimodal setting of text and visual content. This is a multilingual task, and we participated in all three subtasks but we focus only on the English dataset. Our approach is based on a fine-tuning approach with the pre-trained RoBERTa-large model. In addition, for multimodal cases with both textual and visual content, we used the LMM called LlaVa to extract image descriptions and combine them with the meme text. Our system performed well in three subtasks, achieving the tenth best result with an Hierarchical F1 of 64.774%, the fourth best in Subtask 2a with an Hierarchical F1 of 69.003%, and the eighth best in Subtask 2b with a Macro F1 of 78.660%.

TI  - Self-determination theory informed research for promoting physical activity: Contributions, debates, and future directions
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE
AB  - In this review we evaluate the applications of self-determination theory (SDT) research to promote motivation for physical activity (PA) and exercise. The evidence suggests that SDT-informed interventions are often effective at changing health behaviors, including PA/exercise, and associated health outcomes. The effect sizes are small to moderate and are often mediated by increases in autonomous motivation (primarily), interpersonal support for basic psychological needs, and competence need satisfaction. We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA. Our review also provides future conceptual and methodological directions for SDT-based research, building on advances in technology (e.g., generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models) and the broader field of behavioral science (e.g., optimization designs, system-level interventions, behavior change intervention ontologies).

TI  - Developing Personalized Marketing Service Using Generative AI
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - In today's world, the development of social network services (SNS) like Facebook and Instagram has enabled consumers to acquire information about products through various channels. The acquisition of diverse information has led to a diversification in consumer preferences and requirements. As consumer preferences diversify and online channels expand, there is an increasing need for companies to provide personalized marketing. Among the means of personalized marketing, personalized marketing messages are a key tool that can enhance customer engagement. However, a limitation of personalized marketing message services is the cost issue associated with manually writing individual marketing messages for personalization. To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically. In this study, we propose the Persuasive Message Intelligence (PMI) service, which utilizes the recently prominent Large Language Model for automated individual personalized marketing messages. PMI generates marketing messages through prompt engineering based on the theory of persuasion in marketing and prior research on AI-generated messages, and validates the elements of prompts through surveys. The trial and error of researchers presented in this study, along with the know-how and rules of prompt engineering, will serve as guidelines for those who wish to develop services through prompts in the future.

TI  - The future of cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agents: new perspectives and trends
T2  - FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB  - Persuasion, as one of the crucial abilities in human communication, has garnered extensive attention from researchers within the field of intelligent dialogue systems. Developing dialogue agents that can persuade others to accept certain standpoints is essential to achieving truly intelligent and anthropomorphic dialogue systems. Benefiting from the substantial progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), dialogue agents have acquired an exceptional capability in context understanding and response generation. However, as a typical and complicated cognitive psychological system, persuasive dialogue agents also require knowledge from the domain of cognitive psychology to attain a level of human-like persuasion. Consequently, the cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agent (defined as CogAgent), which incorporates cognitive strategies to achieve persuasive targets through conversation, has become a predominant research paradigm. To depict the research trends of CogAgent, in this paper, we first present several fundamental cognitive psychology theories and give the formalized definition of three typical cognitive strategies, including the persuasion strategy, the topic path planning strategy, and the argument structure prediction strategy. Then we propose a new system architecture by incorporating the formalized definition to lay the foundation of CogAgent. Representative works are detailed and investigated according to the combined cognitive strategy, followed by the summary of authoritative benchmarks and evaluation metrics. Finally, we summarize our insights on open issues and future directions of CogAgent for upcoming researchers.

TI  - Effects of Chatbot Components to Facilitate Mental Health Services Use in Individuals With Eating Disorders Following Online Screening: An Optimization Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EATING DISORDERS
AB  - ObjectiveFew individuals with eating disorders (EDs) receive treatment. Innovations are needed to identify individuals with EDs and address care barriers. We developed a chatbot for promoting services uptake that could be paired with online screening. However, it is not yet known which components drive effects. This study estimated individual and combined contributions of four chatbot components on mental health services use (primary), chatbot helpfulness, and attitudes toward changing eating/shape/weight concerns ("change attitudes," with higher scores indicating greater importance/readiness).MethodsTwo hundred five individuals screening with an ED but not in treatment were randomized in an optimization randomized controlled trial to receive up to four chatbot components: psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, personalized service recommendations, and repeated administration (follow-up check-ins/reminders). Assessments were at baseline and 2, 6, and 14 weeks.ResultsParticipants who received repeated administration were more likely to report mental health services use, with no significant effects of other components on services use. Repeated administration slowed the decline in change attitudes participants experienced over time. Participants who received motivational interviewing found the chatbot more helpful, but this component was also associated with larger declines in change attitudes. Participants who received personalized recommendations found the chatbot more helpful, and receiving this component on its own was associated with the most favorable change attitude time trend. Psychoeducation showed no effects.DiscussionResults indicated important effects of components on outcomes; findings will be used to finalize decision making about the optimized intervention package. The chatbot shows high potential for addressing the treatment gap for EDs.

TI  - Framework to Specify Dialogues for Natural Interaction with Conversational Assistants Applied in Prompt Engineering
T2  - INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS, VOL 4, INTELLISYS 2024
CP  - Intelligent Systems Conference
AB  - This article explores the significance of Natural Interaction (NI) in the context of conversational assistants (CAs), aiming to model user dialogues through written and/or spoken language. By NI notion, we consider it is a grammar-free communication language as close as possible to human interaction through written and spoken language, and serves as a highly intuitive means of interaction. It eliminates the need for users to learn new commands, making tasks more accessible. This research addresses the question of which elements and constraints can be employed in crafting NI dialogues for CAs. The emergence of large language models (as ChatGPT) has transformed dialogue specification, reducing the role of producers and enabling users to configure and qualify dialogues based on their needs. The response's quality and user understanding now depend on how well dialogues are specified. This study introduces a framework, DINA, to assist dialogue specifiers, even those without technical or linguistic expertise inAI, CAs, or Human-Computer Interaction, in describing assistant guidelines, dialogue benefits, and other essential attributes for effective NI.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYTEMS, CHI 2024
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Sytems (CHI)
AB  - Lights out! With the escalating climate crisis, eco-feedback has gained prominence over the last decade. However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchiinspired digital character named INFI who gets its life force from the user's energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with INFI. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior.

TI  - Assessing the risks and opportunities posed by AI-enhanced influence operations on social media
T2  - PLACE BRANDING AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY
AB  - Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have the potential to dramatically change the landscape of influence operations. They can generate persuasive, tailored content at scale, making campaigns using falsified content, such as disinformation and fake accounts, easier to produce. Advances in self-hosted open-source models have meant that adversaries can evade content moderation and security checks built into large commercial models such as those commercialised by Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. New multi-lingual models make it easier than ever for foreign adversaries to pose as local actors. This article examines the heightened threats posed by synthetic media, as well as the potential that these tools hold for creating effective countermeasures. It begins with assessing the challenges posed by a toxic combination of automated bots, human-controlled troll accounts, and more targeted social engineering operations. However, the second part of the article assesses the potential for these same tools to improve detection. Promising countermeasures include running internal generative models to bolster training data for internal classifiers, detecting statistical anomalies, identifying output from common prompts, and building specialised classifiers optimised for specific monitoring needs.

TI  - Stereotypical bias amplification and reversal in an experimental model of human interaction with generative artificial intelligence
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB  - Stereotypical biases are readily acquired and expressed by generative artificial intelligence (AI), causing growing societal concern about these systems amplifying existing human bias. This concern rests on reasonable psychological assumptions, but stereotypical bias amplification during human-AI interaction relative to pre-existing baseline levels has not been demonstrated. Here, we use previous psychological work on gendered character traits to capture and control gender stereotypes expressed in character descriptions generated by Open AI's GPT3.5. In four experiments (N = 782) with a first impressions task, we find that unexplained ('black-box') character recommendations using stereotypical traits already convey a potent persuasive influence significantly amplifying baseline stereotyping within first impressions. Recommendations that are counter-stereotypical eliminate and effectively reverse human baseline bias, but these stereotype-challenging influences propagate less well than reinforcing influences from stereotypical recommendations. Critically, the bias amplification and reversal phenomena occur when GPT3.5 elaborates on the core stereotypical content, although GPT3.5's explanations propagate counter-stereotypical influence more effectively and persuasively than black-box recommendations. Our findings strongly imply that without robust safeguards, generative AI will amplify existing bias. But with safeguards, existing bias can be eliminated and even reversed. Our novel approach safely allows such effects to be studied in various contexts where gender and other bias-inducing social stereotypes operate.

T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: ACL 2024
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), it is no longer infeasible to build an automated debate system that helps people to synthesise persuasive arguments. Previous work attempted this task by integrating multiple components. In our work, we introduce an argument mining dataset that captures the end-to-end process of preparing an argumentative essay for a debate, which covers the tasks of claim and evidence identification (Task 1 ED), evidence convincingness ranking (Task 2 ECR), argumentative essay summarisation and human preference ranking (Task 3 ASR) and metric learning for automated evaluation of resulting essays, based on human feedback along argument quality dimensions (Task 4 SQE). Our dataset contains 14k examples of claims that are fully annotated with the various properties supporting the aforementioned tasks. We evaluate multiple generative baselines for each of these tasks, including representative LLMs. We find, that while they show promising results on individual tasks in our benchmark, their end-to-end performance on all four tasks in succession deteriorates significantly, both in automated measures as well as in human-centred evaluation. This challenge presented by our proposed dataset motivates future research on end-to-end argument mining and summarisation.

TI  - How Johnny Can Persuade LLMs to Jailbreak Them: Rethinking Persuasion to Challenge AI Safety by Humanizing LLMs oThis paper contains jailbreaking contents that can be offensive in nature.
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - Most traditional AI safety research views models as machines and centers on algorithmfocused attacks developed by security experts. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. Observing this, we shift the perspective, by treating LLMs as human-like communicators to examine the interplay between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak risk across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 92% on Llama-2-7b-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in 10 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for more fundamental solutions for AI safety

TI  - Reviewer Experience Detecting and Judging Human Versus Artificial Intelligence Content: The Stroke Journal Essay Contest
T2  - STROKE
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) now produce human-like general text and images. LLMs' ability to generate persuasive scientific essays that undergo evaluation under traditional peer review has not been systematically studied. To measure perceptions of quality and the nature of authorship, we conducted a competitive essay contest in 2024 with both human and AI participants. Human authors and 4 distinct LLMs generated essays on controversial topics in stroke care and outcomes research. A panel of Stroke Editorial Board members (mostly vascular neurologists), blinded to author identity and with varying levels of AI expertise, rated the essays for quality, persuasiveness, best in topic, and author type. Among 34 submissions (22 human and 12 LLM) scored by 38 reviewers, human and AI essays received mostly similar ratings, though AI essays were rated higher for composition quality. Author type was accurately identified only 50% of the time, with prior LLM experience associated with improved accuracy. In multivariable analyses adjusted for author attributes and essay quality, only persuasiveness was independently associated with odds of a reviewer assigning AI as author type (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.09-2.16]; P=0.01). In conclusion, a group of experienced editorial board members struggled to distinguish human versus AI authorship, with a bias against best in topic for essays judged to be AI generated. Scientific journals may benefit from educating reviewers on the types and uses of AI in scientific writing and developing thoughtful policies on the appropriate use of AI in authoring manuscripts.

TI  - Cognitive dissonance in programming education: A qualitative exploration of the impact of generative AI on application-directed learning
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS
AB  - Generative AI tools, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are already being extensively used by students to support their learning and it is important that educators understand what this might mean for higher education practice. In this study, two researchers external to the faculty teaching team conducted in-depth interviews with 12 students in a small European university of applied sciences who have recently undertaken programming learning as part of their undergraduate studies. The aim was to explore how these students were using LLMs to support their learning and their perceptions of its value as a learning tool. A thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data revealed trends in the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using LLMs, as well as different levels of LLM usage, with more cautious use associated with a 'meaning-directed' approach to learning (learning pattern) and more enthusiastic and unrestrained use with 'application-directed' patterns of study. A tension was observed between some application-directed learners' high use of LLMs and their recognition that this is not optimal for effective learning. The authors argue that Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) can explain how this dissonance may motivate learners toward a dissonance-reducing attitude or behavior change. The conclusion reflects on the implications for teaching practice and offers some recommendations for how educators can increase metacognition, instrumentalize CDT to increase self-regulation, and facilitate meaning-directed learning patterns in the age of generative AI.

TI  - The Direct Effect of Managerial Responses: When Politeness Backfires
T2  - PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Managerial responses, which represent firms' public replies to online reviews, are commonly employed in customer communications. Using a dataset collected from a leading mobile game app platform in China, this research examines the effect of managerial responses on the review updates of customers who receive them, that is, the direct effect of managerial responses. Platform users can update their reviews, and complete records of review updates are observable, which allows us to utilize variations in the same customer's review ratings of a single game both before and after receiving a managerial response. Addressing concerns regarding the endogeneity of managerial responses, improvements in game quality, and censored data in rating updates, we find that users who update their reviews after receiving managerial responses upgrade their ratings by an average of one star. In addition, we find that the positive direct effect of managerial responses is negatively moderated by the level of response politeness, measured separately using both machine learning and large language models. By conducting a survey study, we further show that as the level of politeness increases, the likelihood of reviewers perceiving a managerial response as an attempt to persuade them also increases. These findings highlight the positive direct effect of managerial response and the importance of response style, specifically politeness, which can produce a backfire effect in online communications.

TI  - The Changing Behavior of the European Credit Default Swap Spreads During the Covid-19 Pandemic: A Bayesian Network Analysis
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS
AB  - The level of financial risk spread out to the world during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that none of the countries are immune to financial uncertainty and the vast changes it brings to economic stability. The contagiousness of sovereign risk is a result of the interdependent structure of countries' financial networks. Yet the analysis of sovereign CDS risk spread using the network view is both new and limited. With this study, we want to use the network view to prove the interconnectedness of the financial systems in Europe and its effect on the spread of the risk throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study is threefold: First, using the Bayesian networks learned from the daily CDS values of 17 European Union countries, we demonstrate the dependent network structure of countries and the movement of the sovereign risk over this network with a cascading behavior. Second, we explore how the probabilistic dependency structure changes over the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to alterations on the behavior of the sovereign risk spread. The previous studies on the sovereign risk spread during the COVID-19 pandemic employs the data over the whole period of the pandemic. However, during the pandemic the behavior of the spread was changing, and to capture that change the consideration of shorter intervals becomes crucial. Therefore, in this study, the COVID-19 crisis period from December 2019 until February 2021 is divided into five phases of 3-month time intervals. As the third and last objective, this study intends to be a roadmap for policy makers as well as for researchers to understand the true nature and connectedness of sovereign risk transmissions. For that purpose, we provide a benchmark procedure for the evaluation of the sovereign risk of countries using Bayesian networks which involves a comprehensive analysis involving several steps conducted on each of the learned Bayesian networks for the different phases of the pandemic. In terms of policy implications, this study aims to be helpful for investors that want to diversify sovereign risk in their bond portfolios and be explanatory for the changing behavior of the risk spread during crisis periods. Moreover, this study exemplifies the use of artificial intelligence methods to understand the working mechanism of economic systems.

TI  - Bayesian Global Optimization Gated Recurrent Unit Model for Human-Driven Vehicle Lane-Change Trajectory Prediction Considering Hyperparameter Optimization
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
AB  - To address the low accuracy and inefficiency of current lane-change trajectory prediction methods for human-driven vehicles, this study develops a neural network lane-change trajectory prediction model with hyperparametric optimization capability using Bayesian optimization and gated recurrent units to consider the effect of lane-change intention on vehicle lane-change behavior and to predict it. The proposed model was instantiated using trajectory data of 8,721 vehicles. The results show that the overall recognition accuracy of intention recognition under the optimal input is 93.54%, and the recognition accuracy of keeping straight, left lane-change and right lane-change is 95.59%, 91.72%, and 93.30%, respectively. The root mean square errors of the predicted and actual trajectories to the left and to the right under the optimal input are 0.2582 and 0.2957, respectively. This paper demonstrates that, for the intention recognition module, the low-dimensional input enables the model to obtain high prediction accuracy, while for the trajectory prediction module, the high-latitude input enables the model to obtain a low prediction error. The developed trajectory prediction model can be used to assist in driving decision-making, path planning, and so forth.

TI  - Can AI and AI-Hybrids Detect Persuasion Skills? Salesforce Hiring with Conversational Video Interviews
T2  - MARKETING SCIENCE
AB  - We develop an AI and AI-human-based model for salesforce hiring using recordings of conversational video interviews that involve two-sided, back-and-forth interactions with messages conveyed through multiple modalities (text, voice, and body language). We derive objective, theory-backed measures of sales performance from these modalities, leveraging recent advances in body language analysis, conversational analysis, and large language models (LLMs). These measures serve as explanatory variables in our AI model. Our key contribution to the broader research on persuasion and influence is that we show how to use conversational videos to capture features related to (i) two-way conversational interactivity; (ii) real-time adaptation; and (iii) human body language, with minimal measurement error relative to extant survey-based approaches that suffer from recall biases. We use rubric-based scores by panels of sales professionals (correlated with hiring decisions) to isolate a candidate's "latent sales ability" and use these as outcome variables to be predicted by the AI model. The AI model achieves reasonable predictive accuracy, yet incorporating human judgments into an AI-human hybrid model enhances its effectiveness-improving workforce quality by 67% over random selection. Although the content of what is spoken is most important in prediction, conversational interactivity, sellers' real-time adaptation to the buyer, and body language also have good explanatory power. Finally, in terms of performance-cost trade-offs, the addition of just one human professional evaluation in the hiring loop in combination with AI is optimal. Further, using human input based on only the two early stages of the interview in a task-based hybrid model is the most cost-effective in improving performance.

TI  - Intelligent Cognitive Assistants for Attitude and Behavior Change Support in Mental Health: State-of-the-Art Technical Review
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Intelligent cognitive assistant (ICA) technology is used in various domains to emulate human behavior expressed through synchronous communication, especially written conversation. Due to their ability to use individually tailored natural language, they present a powerful vessel to support attitude and behavior change. Behavior change support systems are emerging as a crucial tool in digital mental health services, and ICAs exceed in effective support, especially for stress, anxiety and depression (SAD), where ICAs guide people's thought processes and actions by analyzing their affective and cognitive phenomena. Currently, there is no comprehensive review of such ICAs from a technical standpoint, and existing work is conducted exclusively from a psychological or medical perspective. This technical state-of-the-art review tried to discern and systematize current technological approaches and trends as well as detail the highly interdisciplinary landscape of intersections between ICAs, attitude and behavior change, and mental health, focusing on text-based ICAs for SAD. Ten papers with systems, fitting our criteria, were selected. The systems varied significantly in their approaches, with the most successful opting for comprehensive user models, classification-based assessment, personalized intervention, and dialogue tree conversational models.

TI  - The power of human-like virtual-influencer-generated content: Impact on consumers' willingness to follow and purchase intentions
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR REPORTS
AB  - The swift progress in machine learning algorithms, artificial intelligence, and interactive immersive media technologies has led to the introduction of computer-generated imagery on Instagram. This feature, so-called "human-like virtual influencers (VIs)", has revolutionized the way people interact with technology. Using a combination of cutting-edge AI technologies, in a novel application of computer vision algorithms, and large language models to extract the content posted by two popular human-like VIs on Instagram, the present study is the first to categorize and classify types of human-like virtual-influencer-generated content. Quantitative methods, such as partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), were used to examine the impact of human-like virtual-influencer-generated content on consumers' willingness to follow as well as purchase intentions. The information was gathered from 650 Thai customers. The findings showed that consumers' willingness to follow and purchase intentions were significantly influenced by the positive effects of emotional appeal content, which includes relational, entertaining, positive emotion, and negative emotion content. These effects outweighed those of rational appeal content, such as informative and remunerative content, as well as authenticity appeal content. Meanwhile, disclosing sponsored content had no effect on consumers' willingness to follow. The theoretical underpinnings of uses and gratifications (U&G) theory, parasocial relationships and Richins' hierarchical model of emotions are confirmed and expanded upon in this work, and the suggested inclusive approach also significantly advances the expanding corpus of research on VIs. Our research also provides a contribution to the recent literature on human-like VI marketing.

TI  - Using AI chatbots in climate change mitigation: a moderated serial mediation model
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - This study examined the effect of chatbots' emotional expression on climate-change-mitigation behaviour intention and the individual and serial mediating roles of social presence and guilt in the main effect. This study further tested the moderating role of custom addressing in direct and indirect relationships between the aforementioned variables. To that end, 577 American adults were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. After eliminating incomplete responses, the remaining 549 participants were assigned to four conditions (factual vs. emotional conditions x control vs. custom addressing conditions), conversed briefly with a chatbot agent, and responded to a questionnaire. The findings showed that chatbots' emotional expression yielded higher climate-change-mitigation behavioural intention than factual information and that social presence mediated this relationship. The results did not support the mediating role of guilt but supported serial mediation through social presence and guilt. The results further support the moderating role of custom addressing in the indirect relationship through social presence and serially through social presence and guilt. However, the results do not support the moderating role of custom addressing in direct and indirect relationships through guilt.

TI  - Human favoritism, not AI aversion: People's perceptions (and bias) toward generative AI, human experts, and human-GAI collaboration in persuasive content generation
T2  - JUDGMENT AND DECISION MAKING
AB  - With the wide availability of large language models and generative AI, there are four primary paradigms for human-AI collaboration: human-only, AI-only (ChatGPT-4), augmented human (where a human makes the final decision with AI output as a reference), or augmented AI (where the AI makes the final decision with human output as a reference). In partnership with one of the world's leading consulting firms, we enlisted professional content creators and ChatGPT-4 to create advertising content for products and persuasive content for campaigns following the aforementioned paradigms. First, we find that, contrary to the expectations of some of the existing algorithm aversion literature on conventional predictive AI, the content generated by generative AI and augmented AI is perceived as of higher quality than that produced by human experts and augmented human experts. Second, revealing the source of content production reduces-but does not reverse-the perceived quality gap between human- and AI-generated content. This bias in evaluation is predominantly driven by human favoritism rather than AI aversion: Knowing that the same content is created by a human expert increases its (reported) perceived quality, but knowing that AI is involved in the creation process does not affect its perceived quality. Further analysis suggests this bias is not due to a 'quality prime' as knowing the content they are about to evaluate comes from competent creators (e.g., industry professionals and state-of-the-art AI) without knowing exactly that the creator of each piece of content does not increase participants' perceived quality.

TI  - Using ChatGPT and Persuasive Technology for Personalized Recommendation Messages in Hotel Upselling
T2  - INFORMATION
AB  - Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity, and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present pilot experiments with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. Our inhouse commercial hotel marketing platform, eXclusivi, was extended with a new software module working with ChatGPT prompts and persuasive ads created for its recommendations. In particular, we developed an intelligent advertisement (ad) copy generation tool for the hotel marketing platform. The proposed approach allows for the hotel team to target all guests in their language, leveraging the integration with the hotel's reservation system. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between ChatGPT and persuasive technology in recommender systems, ultimately influencing guest satisfaction and hotel revenue.

TI  - An iterative optimization method for sustainable environmental improvement under mixed CAV-HDV traffic
T2  - ENERGY
AB  - This paper proposes an iterative optimization method for trajectory control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) at an off-ramp bottleneck, aiming to improve energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the traffic system. The methodology integrates real-world data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset and generated data from each iteration. A comprehensive cost function is developed to evaluate safety, efficiency, comfort, equilibrium, lane-changing, energy, and emissions. The lane-changing process is divided into two stages: lane-changing decision-making (LCD) and lane-changing execution (LCE), modeled using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Specifically, gcForest is applied to model LCD, while long short-term memory (LSTM) is used for LCE, allowing for more precise control of lane-changing behavior. The analysis considers fuel consumption and key vehicular emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter (PM). The results indicate that energy consumption and pollutant emissions are reduced by 20 % after three iterations of optimization. Furthermore, the iterative method demonstrates significant environmental improvements, particularly when the CAV market penetration rate (MPR) reaches approximately 50 %. Higher MPR levels further enhance the sustainability benefits of CAVs, making them more advantageous for promoting sustainable traffic development.

TI  - Power Optimization Control Scheme for Doubly Fed Induction Generator Used in Wind Turbine Generators
T2  - INVENTIONS
AB  - Scientists and researchers are exploring different methods of generating and delivering electrical energy in an economical and reliable way, enabling them to generate electricity focusing on renewable energy resources. All of these possess the natural property of self-changing behavior, so the connection of these separate independent controllable units to the grid leads to uncertainties. This creates an imbalance in active power and reactive power. In order to control the active and reactive power in wind turbine generators with adjustable speed, various control strategies are used to allay voltage and current variations. This research work is focused on the design and implementation of effective control strategies for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to control its active and reactive power. A DFIG system with its control strategies is simulated on MATLAB software. To augment the transient stability of DFIG, the simulation results for the active and reactive power of conventional controllers are compared with three types of feed forward neural network controllers, i.e., probabilistic feedforward neural network (PFFNN), multi-layer perceptron feedforward neural network (MLPFFN) and radial basic function feedforward neural network (RBFFN) for optimum performance. Conclusive outcomes clearly manifest the superior robustness of the RBFNN controller over other controllers in terms of rise time, settling time and overshoot value.

TI  - Minimax Strategy for Lane Choice Prediction in Markovian Traffic Modeling
T2  - GOL'20: 2020 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON LOGISTICS OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT (GOL)
CP  - 5th IEEE International Conference on Logistics Operations Management (GOL)
AB  - Daily, vehicles overload the road networks. Starting from this worldwide issue, we can see the necessity of finding solutions for travel times improvements. Many solutions arise if we look at the lowest possible level in traffic modeling. At the microscopic level, we can have the best overview of the vehicle's interactions, about their velocity, acceleration or lane change behavior. This paper proposes a new approach of lane choice prediction using an AI (Artificial Intelligence) based gaming strategy. Having a piece of road with the lane change action modeled as Markovian process, for a chosen vehicle, this paper aims to find the best decision considering the desired destination and the involved costs. The lane change action will be described as a game where is involved the vehicle that initiates the action, together with parameters as traffic destination volumes, intermediary traffic volumes associated with distinct lanes and the placement of lanes splitting points. The comparison with the Dijkstra's algorithm, known as the optimal for route choice problem solving, proves the efficiency of the proposed approach. The similar results obtained as destination volumes by comparing with the mentioned optimal algorithm consists of a validation step in this paper proposal.

TI  - Suggestive answers strategy in human-chatbot interaction: a route to engaged critical decision making
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - In this study, we proposed a novel chatbot interaction strategy based on the suggestive ending of answers. This strategy is inspired by the cliffhanger ending narrative technique, which ends a story without specifying conclusions to spark readers' curiosity as to what will happen next and is often used in television series. Common chatbots provide relevant and comprehensive answers to users' questions. In contrast, chatbots with our proposed strategy end their answers with hints potentially interest-triggering users. The suggestive ending strategy aims to stimulate users' inquisition for critical decision-making, relating to a psychological phenomenon where humans are often urged to finish the uncompleted tasks they have initiated. We demonstrated the implication of our strategy by conducting an online user study involving 300 participants, where they used chatbots to perform three decision-making tasks. We adopted a between-subjects factorial experimental design and compared between the following UIs: (1) plain chatbot-it provides a generated answer when participants issue a question; (2) expositive chatbot-it provides a generated answer for a question, adding short summaries of a positive and negative person's opinion for the answer; (3) suggestive chatbot-it provides a generated answer for a question, which ends with a suggestion of a positive and negative person for the answer. We found that users of the suggestive chatbot were inclined to ask more questions to the bot, engage in prolonged decision-making and information-seeking actions, and formulate their opinions from various perspectives. These findings vary with the users' experience with plain and expositive chatbots.

T2  - 2019 23RD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM THEORY, CONTROL AND COMPUTING (ICSTCC)
CP  - 23rd International Conference on System Theory, Control and Computing (ICSTCC)
AB  - New technologies are emerging in all fields of science. Being the case of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), these new technologies are affecting all fields of science, weather improving them or helping the end user into extracting new data, or analyzing data coming from these fields. One of the main focus area of IoT is on the Automotive side. The connected cars, self-driving cars, have been developed using the IoT concepts. New functionalities such as Semi-automatic selfdriving, finding of parking spaces, automatic self-parking vehicles, sending of data to servers via special services, all have been done with the help of IoT. The paper presents a new way of evaluating the car drivers based on data related to speed, acceleration, combined with the existing road signs. The end results will not only bring enhancement into the driving abilities, but also will bring great value to the maintenance of the vehicle and to the overall safety of the driving process. To obtain a better solution the system makes use of 3 algorithms for determining acceleration, breaking, speeding and lane changing behavior of the driver. By using IoT we aim to correct reckless driving, determine the causes of a defect, all based on statistical data collected over a period of time.

TI  - A framework for estimating the matric suction in unsaturated soils using multiple artificial intelligence techniques
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR NUMERICAL AND ANALYTICAL METHODS IN GEOMECHANICS
AB  - Implementation of the state-of-the-art understanding of the mechanics of unsaturated soils into geotechnical engineering practice is partly limited due to the lack of quick, reliable, and economical techniques for matric suction measurement. Matric suction is one of the key stress state variables that significantly influences the hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated soils. In this paper, to address this objective, two artificial intelligence (AI) models were developed for estimating matric suction in unsaturated soils based on the particle swarm optimization support vector regression (PSO-SVR) and multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) algorithms. The results suggest that both these models can reasonably estimate matric suction. Compared to the MARS model, the PSO-SVR model can achieve higher accuracy. Nonetheless, the MARS model facilitates the sensitivity analysis and the selection of essential inputs. A novel integrated framework is proposed and validated, leveraging the strengths, and alleviating the limitations of the PSO-SVR and MARS algorithms for reliable and rapid estimation of matric suction in the range of 0-1500 kPa for low plastic soils (0 < I-p <= 7). Six inputs are required to use this model successfully; some can be measured using conventional laboratory tests, and others can be calculated from mass-volume relationships.

TI  - Sustainability of Nature Parks by Changing Tourist Behavior Using Donations and Generative AI
T2  - 2023 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTATIONAL SCIENCE AND COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE, CSCI 2023
CP  - International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI)
AB  - Nature parks are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Still, they are sometimes abandoned with little use despite their elegant landscapes, or they can be damaged by the influx of people who come for localized and temporary promotions, so it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of tourists continue to visit in a dispersed manner. While theme parks that charge admission fees may control the number of tourists by setting dynamic prices, this approach is not suitable for nature parks that are free of charge. Some nature parks collect donations, but this is not directly aimed at controlling the number of tourists. Therefore, we propose a system to boost and control the number of tourists by providing information to lure tourists to the best spots scattered throughout the vast nature park and offering unique amusement in return for their donations. We developed a smartphone application that amuses response to tourists' donations. In addition, we provided a tourist guide reflecting the status of sightseeing spots in real-time, and 89.6% of the subjects positively evaluated the guide. Furthermore, we observed that having the AI suggest ideas for making sightseeing spots more attractive had the effect of imagining the actions tourists would want to take at those spots.

TI  - Skill Awareness Framework for Learning Design - Re-focusing Experiential Learning Towards Skills that Matter Most in Times of GenAI
T2  - LEARNING FACTORIES OF THE FUTURE, VOL 2, CLF 2024
CP  - 14th International Conference on Learning Factories (CLF)
AB  - The authors introduce a Skills Awareness Framework for Learning Design (SAFLD) to provide guiding principles for learning. Corporate learning is in a state of flux due to disruptive influences such as COVID-19 and the digitalization of the world of work, even into the home office. In the age of generative AI where knowledge is seemingly available at the touch of a button, corporate learning is more than ever challenged to re-focus on teaching critical and relevant skills. Therefore, in the sense of self-reflection, it will be discussed that learning in the moment will still need to be complemented by experiences that change behaviors. These include both cognitive and motor skills and are based on inter- and intra-action of learners and trainers both individually and as a team. When it comes to re-focusing experiential learning towards skills that matter most, learning factories, e.g., the Innovation and Learning Centers or Model-Factories-in-a-Box, play an even more important role than ever before. This hypothesis is supported by Bloom's taxonomy which classifies learning objectives and illustrates that some skills or higher proficiency levels of skills might be acquired by digital, self-paced e-learning or by virtual, instructor-led learning sessions, whereas other skills or higher proficiency levels of skills and deep learning that change behavior might be better acquired by experiential learning. Finally, learning factories can also play a role in bringing the emerging GenAI to life in an application-oriented environment such as a shop floor.

TI  - Online behavior change detection in computer games
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from the game community in the recent years. The ability to build accurate models of player behavior can be useful in many aspects of a game. One important aspect is the tracking of a player's behavior along time, informing every time a change is perceived. This way, the game Artificial Intelligence can adapt itself to better respond to this new behavior. In order to build models of player behavior, researchers frequently resort to Machine Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded game metrics representing player's interactions with the game environment. However, if the player changes styles over time, the constructed models get out of date. In order to address this drawback, this work proposes the use of and incremental learning technique to track a player's behavior during his/her interaction with the game environment. Our approach attempts to automatically detect the moments in time when the player changes behavior. We apply a change detection technique from the area of Data Stream Mining that is based on incremental clustering and novelty detection. We also propose three modifications to the original technique, in order to formalize change detection, improve detection rate and reduce detection delay. Simulations were performed considering data produced by the Unreal Tournament game, showing the applicability of the method to online tracking of a player's behavior and informing whenever behavior changes occur.

TI  - Chatbot Design for a Healthy Life to Celiac Patients: A Study According to a New Behavior Change Model
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - There is an absolute need for technology in our daily life that makes people busy with their smartphones all day long. In the healthcare field, mobile apps have been widely used for the treatment of many diseases. Most of these apps were designed without considering health behavior change models. Celiac disease is a significant public health problem worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, the incidence of celiac disease is 1.5% Celiac patients have a natural demand for resources to facilitate care and research; however, they have not received much attention in the field of healthcare apps. This study introduced a new health behavior change model based on the existing common models and adapted it to the use of technology for the changing behavior of celiac patients towards healthy suitable food. As proof of concept, the new model was applied to the WhatsApp chatbot for patients with celiac disease. To test the impact of the chatbot, 60 Saudi celiac patients participated in three steps. First, they completed a pre-test questionnaire. Then, the participants were divided into two groups: the control group, which was left without any intervention, and the test group, who used the chatbot for 90 days. Finally, all participants completed the post-test questionnaire. The results confirmed a significant statistical difference between both groups, and the test group improved their healthy life in terms of eating habits, reduced celiac symptoms, and commitment to the treatment plan.

TI  - Automated Indexing of Internet Stories for Health Behavior Change: Weight Loss Attitude Pilot Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists.
   Objective: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss.
   Methods: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2x2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read.
   Results: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F-1,F-107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F-1,F-97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F-1,F-107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F-1,F-97=0.78, P=.38).
   Conclusions: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes, such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.

TI  - The persuasive role of generic-you in online interactions
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Persuasion plays a crucial role in human communication. Yet, convincing someone to change their mind is often challenging. Here, we demonstrate that a subtle linguistic device, generic-you (i.e., "you" that refers to people in general, e.g., "You win some, you lose some"), is associated with successfully shifting people's pre-existing views in a naturalistic context. Leveraging Large Language Models, we conducted a preregistered study using a large (\documentclass[12pt]{minimal} \usepackage{amsmath} \usepackage{wasysym} \usepackage{amsfonts} \usepackage{amssymb} \usepackage{amsbsy} \usepackage{mathrsfs} \usepackage{upgreek} \setlength{\oddsidemargin}{-69pt} \begin{document}$$N_{trials}$$\end{document} = 204,120) online debate dataset. Every use of generic-you in an argument was associated with an up to 14% percent increase in the odds of successful persuasion. These findings underscore the need to distinguish between the specific and generic uses of "you" in large-scale linguistic analyses, an aspect that has been overlooked in the literature. The robust association between generic-you and persuasion persisted with the inclusion of various covariates, and above and beyond other pronouns (i.e., specific-you, I or we). However, these findings do not imply causality. In Supplementary Experiment 2, arguments with generic-you (vs. first-person singular pronouns, e.g., I) were rated as more persuasive by open-minded individuals. In Supplementary Experiment 3, generic-you (vs. specific-you) arguments did not differentially predict attitude change. We discuss explanations for these results, including differential mechanisms, boundary conditions, and the possibility that people intuitively draw on generic-you when expressing more persuasive ideas. Together, these findings add to a growing literature on the interpersonal implications of broadening one's perspective via a subtle shift in language, while motivating future research on contextual and individual differences that may moderate these effects.

TI  - Emulating fundamental analysts: Analytical stage-based multi-agent framework enhanced with expert guidance and Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment
T2  - INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), some studies have explored their potential for predicting stock prices based on financial texts. However, previous research often overlooked the depth of analysis generated by LLMs, resulting in reasoning processes inferior to those of human analysts. In fundamental investing, which requires in-depth company analysis, conclusions from imperfect reasoning lack persuasiveness. In this study, inspired by the analysis process of human analysts, we propose an "Analytical Stage-Based Multi-Agent Framework"to enable LLMs to perform in-depth fundamental analysis. This framework divides the analysis into multiple stages, assigning an LLM agent to each. We enhance each agent's capabilities for its specific task through expert guidance or fine-tuning, allowing them to collectively emulate the workflow of human analysts. Furthermore, we introduce Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment, anew method for fine-tuning LLMs. This approach addresses the decline in likelihood of generating correct responses that occurs after using existing preference alignment methods. It employs an objective function with two terms: one to increase likelihood and another to preserve aligned preference. We conducted experiments using our framework to analyze company earnings releases. We evaluated the analysis quality based on comprehensiveness and logical soundness, while correctness was assessed by using stock prices as the ground truth to calculate the Matthews correlation coefficient and F1 score. Results demonstrate that even without expert guidance and fine-tuning, our multi-agent framework can enhance LLMs in both analysis quality and correctness. When combined with expert guidance and fine-tuning, the performance is further improved.

TI  - Looking for a better fit? An Incremental Learning Multimodal Object Referencing Framework adapting to Individual Drivers
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF 2024 29TH ANNUAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES, IUI 2024
CP  - 29th ACM Annual International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI)
AB  - The rapid advancement of the automotive industry towards automated and semi-automated vehicles has rendered traditional methods of vehicle interaction, such as touch-based and voice command systems, inadequate for a widening range of non-driving related tasks, such as referencing objects outside of the vehicle. Consequently, research has shifted toward gestural input (e.g., hand, gaze, and head pose gestures) as a more suitable mode of interaction during driving. However, due to the dynamic nature of driving and individual variation, there are significant differences in drivers' gestural input performance. While, in theory, this inherent variability could be moderated by substantial data-driven machine learning models, prevalent methodologies lean towards constrained, single-instance trained models for object referencing. These models show a limited capacity to continuously adapt to the divergent behaviors of individual drivers and the variety of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose IcRegress, a novel regression-based incremental learning approach that adapts to changing behavior and the unique characteristics of drivers engaged in the dual task of driving and referencing objects. We suggest a more personalized and adaptable solution for multimodal gestural interfaces, employing continuous lifelong learning to enhance driver experience, safety, and convenience. Our approach was evaluated using an outside-the-vehicle object referencing use case, highlighting the superiority of the incremental learning models adapted over a single trained model across various driver traits such as handedness, driving experience, and numerous driving conditions. Finally, to facilitate reproducibility, ease deployment, and promote further research, we offer our approach as an open-source framework at https://github.com/amrgomaaelhady/IcRegress.

TI  - A review on performance of artificial intelligence and conventional method in mitigating PV grid-tied related power quality events
T2  - RENEWABLE & SUSTAINABLE ENERGY REVIEWS
AB  - Integration of renewable energy resources into power networks is the trend in power distribution system. It is to reduce burden of centralized power plant and global emissions, increase usage of renewable energy, and diverse energy supply market. However, solar photovoltaic which is a type of renewable energy resource, is found to generate peak capacity for a short duration only. Next, its output is intermittent and randomness. In addition, it changes behavior of power distribution system from unidirectional to bidirectional. As a result, it causes different types of power quality events to the power networks. Therefore, these power quality events are urged to be mitigated to further explore the potential of solar photovoltaic system. This paper aims to investigate negative impacts of photovoltaic (PV) grid-tied system to the power networks, and study on performance of artificial intelligence (Al) and conventional methods in mitigating power quality event. According to the surveys, power system monitoring, inverter, dynamic voltage regulator, static synchronous compensator, unified power quality conditioner and energy storage system are able to compensate power quality events which are caused by PV grid-tied system. From the studies, Al methods usually outperform conventional methods in terms of response time and controllability. They also show talent in multi-mode operation, which is to switch to different operation modes according to the environment. However, they require memory to achieve above mentioned tasks. It is believed that unsupervised learning Al is the future trend as it can adapt to the environment without the need of collecting large amount of data before the AI is implemented.

TI  - MultiSentimentArcs: a novel method to measure coherence in multimodal sentiment analysis for long-form narratives in film
T2  - FRONTIERS IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
AB  - Affective artificial intelligence and multimodal sentiment analysis play critical roles in designing safe and effective human-computer interactions and are in diverse applications ranging from social chatbots to eldercare robots. However emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence can also manipulate, persuade, and otherwise compromise human autonomy. We face a constant stream of ever more capable models that can better understand nuanced, complex, and interrelated sentiments across different modalities including text, vision, and speech. This paper introduces MultiSentimentArcs, combination of an open and extensible multimodal sentiment analysis framework, a challenging movie dataset, and a novel benchmark. This enables the quantitative and qualitative identification, comparison, and prioritization of conflicting sentiments commonly arising from different models and modalities. Diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis is especially challenging in film narratives where actors, directors, cinematographers and editors use dialog, characters, and other elements in contradiction with each other to accentuate dramatic tension. MultiSentimentArcs uses local open-source software models to democratize artificial intelligence. We demonstrate how a simple 2-step pipeline of specialized open-source software with a large multimodal model followed by a large language model can approximate video sentiment analysis of a commercial state-of-the-art Claude 3 Opus. To the best of our knowledge, MultiSentimentArcs is the first fully open-source diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis framework, dataset, and benchmark to enable automatic or human-in-the-loop exploration, analysis, and critique of multimodal sentiment analysis on long-form narratives. We demonstrate two novel coherence metrics and a methodology to identify, quantify, and explain real-world sentiment models and modalities. MultiSentimentArcs integrates artificial intelligence with traditional narrative studies and related fields like film, linguistic and cultural studies. It also contributes to eXplainable artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence safety by enhancing artificial intelligence transparency in surfacing emotional persuasion, manipulation, and deception techniques. Finally, it can filter noisy emotional input and prioritize information rich channels to build more performant real-world human computer interface applications in fields like e-learning and medicine. This research contributes to the field of Digital Humanities by giving non-artificial intelligence experts access to directly engage in analysis and critique of research around affective artificial intelligence and human-AI alignment.

TI  - Communication Strategy on Macro-and-Micro Traffic State in Cooperative Deep Reinforcement Learning for Regional Traffic Signal Control
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS
AB  - Adaptive Traffic Signal Control (ATSC) has become a popular research topic in intelligent transportation systems. Regional Traffic Signal Control (RTSC) using the Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (MADRL) technique has become a promising approach for ATSC due to its ability to achieve the optimum trade-off between scalability and optimality. Most existing RTSC approaches partition a traffic network into several disjoint regions, followed by applying centralized reinforcement learning techniques to each region. However, the pursuit of cooperation among RTSC agents still remains an open issue and no communication strategy for RTSC agents has been investigated. In this paper, we propose communication strategies to capture the correlation of micro-traffic states among lanes and the correlation of macro-traffic states among intersections. We first justify that the evolution equation of the RTSC process is Markovian via a system of store-and-forward queues. Next, based on the evolution equation, we propose two GAT-Aggregated (GA2) communication modules-GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug to extract both intra-region and inter-region correlations between macro and micro traffic states. While GA2-Naive only considers the movements at each intersection, GA2-Aug also considers the lane-changing behavior of vehicles. Two proposed communication modules are then aggregated into two existing novel RTSC frameworks-RegionLight and Regional-DRL. Experimental results demonstrate that both GA2-Naive and GA2-Aug effectively improve the performance of existing RTSC frameworks under both real and synthetic scenarios. Hyperparameter testing also reveals the robustness and potential of our communication modules in large-scale traffic networks.

T2  - HIGH-SPEED BIOMEDICAL IMAGING AND SPECTROSCOPY: TOWARD BIG DATA INSTRUMENTATION AND MANAGEMENT II
CP  - Conference on High-Speed Biomedical Imaging and Spectroscopy - Toward Big Data Instrumentation and Management II
AB  - Cell reagents used in biomedical analysis often change behavior of the cells that they are attached to, inhibiting their native signaling. On the other hand, label-free cell analysis techniques have long been viewed as challenging either due to insufficient accuracy by limited features, or because of low throughput as a sacrifice of improved precision. We present a recently developed artificial-intelligence augmented microscope, which builds upon high-throughput time stretch quantitative phase imaging (TS-QPI) and deep learning to perform label-free cell classification with record high-accuracy. Our system captures quantitative optical phase and intensity images simultaneously by frequency multiplexing, extracts multiple biophysical features of the individual cells from these images fused, and feeds these features into a supervised machine learning model for classification. The enhanced performance of our system compared to other label-free assays is demonstrated by classification of white blood T-cells versus colon cancer cells and lipid accumulating algal strains for biofuel production, which is as much as five-fold reduction in inaccuracy. This system obtains the accuracy required in practical applications such as personalized drug development, while the cells remain intact and the throughput is not sacrificed. Here, we introduce a data acquisition scheme based on quadrature phase demodulation that enables interruptionless storage of TS-QPI cell images. Our proof of principle demonstration is capable of saving 40 TB of cell images in about four hours, i.e. pictures of every single cell in 10 mL of a sample.

TI  - Enhancing thermal energy storage: The impact of inclined enclosure geometry and artificial neural network based modeling on phase change material melting performance
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENERGY STORAGE
AB  - This study investigates the heat transfer dynamics and phase change behavior of Lauric acid in different Phase Change Material (PCM) enclosure configurations during the melting process. Four enclosure designs are analyzed: a rectangular enclosure and three enclosures with inclined walls at angles of 30 degrees, 45 degrees, and 60 degrees. A constant temperature of 70 degrees C is applied to the right wall, with temperature propagation and liquid fraction evolution monitored. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN) trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, are utilized to model and predict the liquid fraction for Case 01, demonstrating the robustness and precision of the proposed solutions. Results indicate that the rectangular enclosure (Case 01) has the longest melting time (11,040 s) and the highest heat storage values, with sensible heat at 64.8KJ and total heat storage at 191.5KJ. Inclined enclosures reduce melting times: 30 degrees (Case 02) achieves 9200 s (16.66 % time saving), 45 degrees (Case 03) reduces further to 8440 s (23.55 % time saving), and 60 degrees (Case 04) reaches 8200 s (25.72 % time saving). Increased inclinations enhance convection currents, accelerating heat transfer and melting. However, these reductions in melting time led to decreased heat storage, with Case 04 having the lowest values (62.41KJ sensible heat and 189.11KJ total heat). Economic analysis, based on the costeffectiveness metric (Pc), reveals that Case 03 demonstrates the highest economic performance (Pc = 2.66), balancing optimal melting time with high total energy storage. These findings underscore that modifying PCM enclosure shapes enhances both thermal and economic efficiency, highlighting the importance of integrating AI- based modeling with geometric optimization for superior Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system design.

TI  - Development and Evaluation of a Smartphone-Based Chatbot Coach to Facilitate a Balanced Lifestyle in Individuals With Headaches (BalanceUP App): Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Primary headaches, including migraine and tension-type headaches, are widespread and have a social, physical, mental, and economic impact. Among the key components of treatment are behavior interventions such as lifestyle modification. Scalable conversational agents (CAs) have the potential to deliver behavior interventions at a low threshold. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of behavioral interventions delivered by CAs for the treatment of headaches. Objective: This study has 2 aims. The first aim was to develop and test a smartphone-based coaching intervention (BalanceUP) for people experiencing frequent headaches, delivered by a CA and designed to improve mental well-being using various behavior change techniques. The second aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of BalanceUP by comparing the intervention and waitlist control groups and assess the engagement and acceptance of participants using BalanceUP. Methods: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, adults with frequent headaches were recruited on the web and in collaboration with experts and allocated to either a CA intervention (BalanceUP) or a control condition. The effects of the treatment on changes in the primary outcome of the study, that is, mental well-being (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale), and secondary outcomes (eg, psychosomatic symptoms, stress, headache-related self-efficacy, intention to change behavior, presenteeism and absenteeism, and pain coping) were analyzed using linear mixed models and Cohen d. Primary and secondary outcomes were self-assessed before and after the intervention, and acceptance was assessed after the intervention. Engagement was measured during the intervention using self-reports and usage data. Results: A total of 198 participants (mean age 38.7, SD 12.14 y; n=172, 86.9% women) participated in the study (intervention group: n=110; waitlist control group: n=88). After the intervention, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed evidence for improved well-being (treatment: beta estimate=-3.28, 95% CI -5.07 to -1.48) with moderate between-group effects (Cohen d=-0.66, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.33) in favor of the intervention group. We also found evidence of reduced somatic symptoms, perceived stress, and absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as improved headache management self-efficacy, application of behavior change techniques, and pain coping skills, with effects ranging from medium to large (Cohen d=0.43-1.05). Overall, 64.8% (118/182) of the participants used coaching as intended by engaging throughout the coaching and completing the outro. Conclusions: BalanceUP was well accepted, and the results suggest that coaching delivered by a CA can be effective in reducing the burden of people who experience headaches by improving their well-being.

TI  - Using Artificial Intelligence to Reduce the Risk of Nonadherence in Patients on Anticoagulation Therapy
T2  - STROKE
AB  - Background and Purpose-This study evaluated the use of an artificial intelligence platform on mobile devices in measuring and increasing medication adherence in stroke patients on anticoagulation therapy. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants, while reducing the need for monitoring, have also placed pressure on patients to self-manage. Suboptimal adherence goes undetected as routine laboratory tests are not reliable indicators of adherence, placing patients at increased risk of stroke and bleeding.
   Methods-A randomized, parallel-group, 12-week study was conducted in adults (n=28) with recently diagnosed ischemic stroke receiving any anticoagulation. Patients were randomized to daily monitoring by the artificial intelligence platform (intervention) or to no daily monitoring (control). The artificial intelligence application visually identified the patient, the medication, and the confirmed ingestion. Adherence was measured by pill counts and plasma sampling in both groups.
   Results-For all patients (n=28), mean (SD) age was 57 years (13.2 years) and 53.6% were women. Mean (SD) cumulative adherence based on the artificial intelligence platform was 90.5% (7.5%). Plasma drug concentration levels indicated that adherence was 100% (15 of 15) and 50% (6 of 12) in the intervention and control groups, respectively.
   Conclusions-Patients, some with little experience using a smartphone, successfully used the technology and demonstrated a 50% improvement in adherence based on plasma drug concentration levels. For patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants, absolute improvement increased to 67%. Real-time monitoring has the potential to increase adherence and change behavior, particularly in patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy.

TI  - A game theoretical model to examine pedestrian behaviour and safety on unsignalised slip lanes using AI-based video analytics
T2  - ACCIDENT ANALYSIS AND PREVENTION
AB  - Left-turn slip lanes, also known as channelised right-turn lanes in right-hand driving countries, are widely implemented to facilitate left-turning at signalised intersections. However, pedestrian safety on slip lanes is not well known. At unsignalised crosswalks, the joint decision-making process of both pedestrians and motorists is complex, involving joint communication dynamics, yet current research primarily focuses on examining individual decisions. This study proposes a game theory-based approach, formulating the interaction as a two-player, non-cooperative, simultaneous game to examine those joint decision-making dynamics, their resulting behaviours, and associated crash risks. The approach compares two well-known equilibriums of game theory, namely Quantal Response Equilibrium (QRE) and Nash Equilibrium (NE), based on real-world pedestrian-motorist interaction video data collected over two days, each day spanning 12 h, from two slip lanes with zebra crossings at signalised intersections in Brisbane, Australia. Artificial intelligence-based video analytics extracted interaction data, which was modelled using binary logit models to understand the crossing and yielding decisions of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that the QRE outperforms the NE in predicting the crossing intention of pedestrians and the yielding intention of motorists. Results indicate that a) motorists are less likely to yield to pedestrians when the vehicle speed is higher, b) pedestrians are more likely to let the motorists go first if they start crossing from the curbside of the road, and c) motorists are more likely to yield to pedestrians when the distance between pedestrians and vehicles is longer. According to the QRE model, the probability of conflict is 5.8%, indicating that 5.8% of pedestrian interactions with vehicles in these slip lanes result in conflicts. Similarly, the confusion probability indicates that about 5.2% of pedestrians were confused about initiating crossing in the presence of zebra crossing even though drivers yielded them on slip lanes at signalised intersections. This study highlights the significance of using game theory-based approaches to understand road users' behaviour on slip lanes. These findings can help to identify pedestrian crossing intentions and support connected automated vehicles in making stopping decisions to enhance pedestrian safety and reduce potential conflicts with other road users.

TI  - Designing for Workplace Reflection: A Chat and Voice-Based Conversational Agent
T2  - DIS 2018: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 DESIGNING INTERACTIVE SYSTEMS CONFERENCE
CP  - Designing Interactive Systems (DIS) Conference
AB  - Conversational agents stand to play an important role in supporting behavior change and well-being in many domains. With users able to interact with conversational agents through both text and voice, understanding how designing for these channels supports behavior change is important. To begin answering this question, we designed a conversational agent for the workplace that supports workers' activity journaling and self-learning through reflection. Our agent, named Robota, combines chat-based communication as a Slack Bot and voice interaction through a personal device using a custom Amazon Alexa Skill. Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers' reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our findings to design of workplace self-tracking systems specifically and to behavior-change systems in general.

T2  - INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2010
CP  - 10th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)
AB  - We present an empirical study on the impact of linguistic and cultural tailoring of a conversational agent on its ability to change user attitudes. We designed two bilingual (English and Spanish) conversational agents to resemble members of two distinct cultures (Anglo-American and Latino) and conducted the study with participants from the two corresponding populations. Our results show that cultural tailoring and participants' personality traits have a significant interaction effect on the agent's persuasiveness and perceived trustworthiness.

TI  - Assistive Conversational Agent for Health Coaching: A Validation Study
T2  - METHODS OF INFORMATION IN MEDICINE
AB  - Objective Poor lifestyle represents a health risk factor and is the leading cause of morbidity and chronic conditions. The impact of poor lifestyle can be significantly altered by individual's behavioral modification. Although there are abundant lifestyle promotion applications and tools, they are still limited in providing tailored social support that goes beyond their predefined functionalities. In addition, virtual coaching approaches are still unable to handle user emotional needs. Our approach presents a human-virtual agent mediated system that leverages the conversational agent to handle menial caregiver's works by engaging users (e.g., patients) in a conversation with the conversational agent. The dialog used a natural conversation to interact with users, delivered by the conversational agent and handled with a finite state machine automaton. Our research differs from existing approaches that replace a human coach with a fully automated assistant on user support. The methodology allows users to interact with the technology and access health-related interventions. To assist physicians, the conversational agent gives weighting to user's adherence, based on prior defined conditions.
   Materials and Methods This article describes the design and validation of CoachAI, a conversational agent-assisted health coaching system to support health intervention delivery to individuals or groups. CoachAI instantiates a text-based health care conversational agent system that bridges the remote human coach and the users.
   Results We will discuss our approach and highlight the outcome of a 1-month validation study on physical activity, healthy diet, and stress coping. The study validates technology aspects of our human-virtual agent mediated health coaching system. We present the intervention settings and findings from the study. In addition, we present some user-experience validation results gathered during or after the experimentation.
   Conclusions The study provided a set of dimensions when building a human-conversational agent powered health intervention tool. The results provided interesting insights when using human-conversational agent mediated approach in health coaching systems. The findings revealed that users who were highly engaged were also more adherent to conversational-agent activities. This research made key contributions to the literature on techniques in providing social, yet tailored health coaching support: (1) identifying habitual patterns to understand user preferences; (2) the role of a conversational agent in delivering health promoting microactivities; (3) building the technology while adhering to individuals' daily messaging routine; and (4) a socio-technical system that fits with the role of conversational agent as an assistive component.
   Future Work Future improvements will consider building the activity recommender based on users' interaction data and integrating users' dietary pattern and emotional wellbeing into the initial user clustering by leveraging information and communication technology approaches (e.g., machine learning). We will integrate a sentiment analysis capability to gather further data about individuals and report these data to the caregiver.

AB  - The ability to engage the user in a conversation and the credibility of the system are two fundamental characteristics of virtual coaches. In this paper, we present the architecture of a conversational e-coach for promoting healthy lifestyles in older age, developed in the context of the NESTORE H2020 EU project. The proposed system allows multiple access points to a conversational agent via different interaction modalities: a tangible companion that embodies the virtual coach will leverage voice and other non-verbal cues in the domestic environment, while a mobile app will integrate a text-based chat for a ubiquitous intervention. In both cases, the conversational agent will deliver personalized interventions based on behavior change models and will promote trust by means of emotionally rich conversations.

TI  - Extending Conversational Agents for Task-Oriented Human-Computer Dialogue
T2  - CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS AND NATURAL LANGUAGE INTERACTION: TECHNIQUES AND EFFECTIVE PRACTICES
AB  - We present the role of conversational agents in two task-oriented human-computer dialogue applications: Interactive Question Answering and Persuasive Dialogue. We show that conversational agents can be effectively deployed for interaction that goes beyond user entertainment and can be successfully used as a means to achieve complex tasks. Conversational agents are a winning solution in Persuasive Dialogue because, combined with a planning infrastructure, they can help manage the parts of the dialogue that cannot be planned a priori and are primordial to keep the system persuasive. In Interactive Question Answering, conversational approaches lead users to the explicit formulation of queries, allow for the submission of further queries and accomodate related queries thanks to their ability to handle context.

TI  - Assessing the Feasibility of a Text-Based Conversational Agent for Asthma Support: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Observational Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Despite efforts, the UK death rate from asthma is the highest in Europe, and 65% of people with asthma in the United Kingdom do not receive the professional care they are entitled to. Experts have recommended the use of digital innovations to help address the issues of poor outcomes and lack of care access. An automated SMS text messaging-based conversational agent (ie, chatbot) created to provide access to asthma support in a familiar format via a mobile phone has the potential to help people with asthma across demographics and at scale. Such a chatbot could help improve the accuracy of self-assessed risk, improve asthma self-management, increase access to professional care, and ultimately reduce asthma attacks and emergencies.Objective: The aims of this study are to determine the feasibility and usability of a text-based conversational agent that processes a patient's text responses and short sample voice recordings to calculate an estimate of their risk for an asthma exacerbation and then offers follow-up information for lowering risk and improving asthma control; assess the levels of engagement for different groups of users, particularly those who do not access professional services and those with poor asthma control; and assess the extent to which users of the chatbot perceive it as helpful for improving their understanding and self-management of their condition.Methods: We will recruit 300 adults through four channels for broad reach: Facebook, YouGov, Asthma + Lung UK social media, and the website Healthily (a health self-management app). Participants will be screened, and those who meet inclusion criteria (adults diagnosed with asthma and who use WhatsApp) will be provided with a link to access the conversational agent through WhatsApp on their mobile phones. Participants will be sent scheduled and randomly timed messages to invite them to engage in dialogue about their asthma risk during the period of study. After a data collection period (28 days), participants will respond to questionnaire items related to the quality of the interaction. A pre-and postquestionnaire will measure asthma control before and after the intervention.Results: This study was funded in March 2021 and started in January 2022. We developed a prototype conversational agent, which was iteratively improved with feedback from people with asthma, asthma nurses, and specialist doctors. Fortnightly reviews of iterations by the clinical team began in September 2022 and are ongoing. This feasibility study will start recruitment in January 2023. The anticipated completion of the study is July 2023. A future randomized controlled trial will depend on the outcomes of this study and funding.Conclusions: This feasibility study will inform a follow-up pilot and larger randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a conversational agent on asthma outcomes, self-management, behavior change, and access to care.

TI  - The Effectiveness of Artificial Intelligence Conversational Agents in Health Care: Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption.
   Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents.
   Methods: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another.
   Results: A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback.
   Conclusions: The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.

T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY: DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PERSONALIZED TECHNOLOGIES TO CHANGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS, PERSUASIVE 2017
CP  - 12th International Conference on Persuasive Technologies (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - Individuals with chronic stress can improve their overall wellness by making lifestyle changes. We describe the design and evaluation of a computer-animated conversational agent that is used in conjunction with Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) to help individuals with chronic pain and depression manage their stress. The agent coaches patients in between group visit sessions, reviewing how to manage stress using non-pharmaceutical techniques (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, yoga self-massage). We conducted a longitudinal clinical trial with 154 participants in which patients in the intervention group interacted with the conversational agent at home on a touch screen tablet to reinforce what they learned in group medical visits. Results from the trial indicate that the conversational agent, in conjunction with medical group visits, leads to significantly more positive stress management behaviors in patients compared to outcomes that arise in usual care, after 9 and 21 weeks.

TI  - Intelligent Conversational Agent for Online Sales
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2018 10TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ELECTRONICS, COMPUTERS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ECAI)
CP  - 10th International Conference on Electronics, Computers and Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)
AB  - A conversational agent is one of emerging technologies that will take place in several of life domains, including e-commerce. The common features of any conversational agent in any domain is its ability to have a dialog with a human user and 24/7 available. Thus, including a conversational agent in an online business will give benefits not only to online retailers, but also e-customers. However, a conversational agent for online sales may have a different feature than a conversational agent in other domain such as health care. The main task of a conversational agent in an online sales domain is to engage and persuade e-commerce customers to buy a product. In a real life, persuasion is considered as an abstract process, which only can be achieved through a series of dialogs. In a virtual world, a conversational agent for online sales is considered intelligent if it is able to demonstrate this feature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to demonstrate persuasion feature through recommendation and negotiation dialogs to meet e-customers' needs. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented and preliminary results indicate the proposed method is successful.

TI  - Computational Psychotherapy System for Mental Health Prediction and Behavior Change with a Conversational Agent
T2  - NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT
AB  - Background: The importance of computational psychotherapy is increasing due to the record high prevalence of mental health issues worldwide. Despite advancements, current computational psychotherapy systems lack advanced prediction and behavior change mechanisms using conversational agents. Purpose: This work presents a computational psychotherapy system for mental health prediction and behavior change using a conversational agent. It makes two major contributions. First, we introduce a novel, golden standard dataset, comprising panel data with 1495 instances of quantitative stress, anxiety, and depression (SAD) symptom scores from diagnostic-level questionnaires and qualitative daily diary entries. Second, we present the computational psychotherapy system itself. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that simulating a theory of mind- the human cognitive ability to understand others - in a conversational agent enhances its effectiveness in relieving mental health issues. Methods: The system simulates theory of mind with a cognitive architecture comprising an ensemble of computational models, using cognitive modelling and machine learning models trained on the novel dataset, and novel ontologies. The system was evaluated through a computational experiment on mental health phenomena prediction from text, and an empirical interventional study on relieving mental health issues in 42 participants. Results: The system outperformed state-of-the-art systems in terms of the number of detected categories and detection accuracy (highest accuracy: 91.41% using k-nearest neighbors (kNN); highest accuracy of other systems: 84% using long-short term memory network (LSTM)). The highest accuracy for 7-day forecasting was 87.68%, whereas the other systems were not able to forecast trends. In the study, the system outperformed Woebot, the current state-of-the-art, in reducing stress (p = 0.004) and anxiety (p = 0.008) levels. Conclusion: The confirmation of our hypothesis indicates that incorporating theory of mind simulation in conversational agents significantly enhances their efficacy in computational psychotherapy, offering a promising advancement for mental health interventions and support compared to current state-of-the-art systems.

TI  - Operationalizing Behavior Change Techniques in Conversational Agents
T2  - ICAART: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 14TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AGENTS AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - VOL 1
CP  - 14th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART)
AB  - Departing from previous work on the use of well-established behavior change techniques in an mHealth intervention based on a conversational agent (CA), we propose in this contribution a new architecture for the design of behavior change CAs. This novel approach combines the use of an advanced natural language platform (Dialogflow) with the explicit representation, in an ontology, of how behavior change techniques can be operationalized. The integration of these two components is explained, as well as the most challenging aspect of using the advanced features of the platform in a way that allowed the agent to lead the dialogue flow, when needed. A successful proof of concept was built, which can be the basis for the development of advanced conversational agents, combining natural language tools with ontology-based knowledge representation.

TI  - Motivational Interviewing Conversational Agent for Parents as Proxies for Their Children in Healthy Eating: Development and User Testing
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Increased adoption of off-the-shelf conversational agents (CAs) brings opportunities to integrate therapeutic interventions. Motivational Interviewing (MI) can then be integrated with CAs for cost-effective access to it. MI can be especially beneficial for parents who often have low motivation because of limited time and resources to eat healthy together with their children.Objective: We developed a Motivational Interviewing Conversational Agent (MICA) to improve healthy eating in parents who serve as a proxy for health behavior change in their children. Proxy relationships involve a person serving as a catalyst for behavior change in another person. Parents, serving as proxies, can bring about behavior change in their children.Methods: We conducted user test sessions of the MICA prototype to understand the perceived acceptability and usefulness of the MICA prototype by parents. A total of 24 parents of young children participated in 2 user test sessions with MICA, approximately 2 weeks apart. After parents' interaction with the MICA prototype in each user test session, we used qualitative interviews to understand parents' perceptions and suggestions for improvements in MICA.Results: Findings showed participants' perceived usefulness of MICAs for helping them self-reflect and motivating them to adopt healthier eating habits together with their children. Participants further suggested various ways in which MICA can help them safely manage their children's eating behaviors and provide customized support for their proxy needs and goals.Conclusions: We have discussed how the user experience of CAs can be improved to uniquely offer support to parents who serve as proxies in changing the behavior of their children. We have concluded with implications for a larger context of designing MI-based CAs for supporting proxy relationships for health behavior change.

TI  - Friend or Foe? Conversational Agents in the Digital Workplace and Their Effect on Users' Stress
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND NEUROSCIENCE, NEUROIS RETREAT 2023
CP  - 15th Annual Conference on NeuroIS Retreat
AB  - Stress in the workplace and the resulting disorders present a significant challenge for the employee, employer, and national economy. According to the transactional model of stress, a possible reduction in stress can be achieved by reevaluating the situation. According to the social response theory, conversational agents should be very suitable for this task, as their increased persuasiveness leads to increased confidence of the user in their abilities. However, the perception of a social agent could also present an additional source of social evaluation stress, i.e., feeling observed and judged by another person. We propose a NeuroIS experiment utilizing EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking to resolve those opposing predictions.

TI  - Persuasion-Building Fundamental Premises and Implications for Conversational Agents: A Conceptual Model in Captology
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2023
CP  - 18th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - In the area of captology, computers as persuasive technology, conversational agent or dialogue system represent an interactive computing product as a key to changing people's viewpoints. Our former original experimental research addressed that a virtual agent's positive facial expressions and near-distance camera angle successfully influence participants' thoughts during an experiment. However, fragmentation in this growing topic led to theoretical confusion. To move the field forward, this paper uncovers the evidence-based elements as the standard compliance for designing the persuasive conversational agent. First, the fundamental premises, implications, constructs, and indicators from our previous original research were generated. Second, a theory synthesis from related articles on the interaction between virtual agents to humans, with the aim of persuading, was analyzed. Thus, it derives twelve fundamental premises, two implications, three main constructs, and fifteen indicators. Third, a model elaborates on the relationships between these constructs and indicators was developed. Its foundation is based on the three related concepts of the Persuasion Knowledge Model, Stimulus-Organism-Response Theory, Fogg's Captology Framework, and one measurement model of Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. Hence, the theory synthesis provides the basis for inventing the proposed conceptual model, called the Agent-Subject Persuasion Model (ASPM), which emphasizes the originality of this research.

TI  - Usability of Conversational Agents by Patients with Inadequate Health Literacy: Evidence from Two Clinical Trials
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTH COMMUNICATION
AB  - Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) are computer-animated characters that simulate face-to-face conversation with patients. These agents can be programmed with best practices in human-human health communication and used for automated health education and behavior change counseling interventions. Evidence is presented from two ongoing clinical trials demonstrating that patients at different levels of health literacy find these agents acceptable and easy to use for automated health communication interventions. Innovative computer interface systems can be used to ensure that inadequate health literacy not serve as a barrier to interventions using health information technology.

TI  - Conversational Agent for Healthy Lifestyle Behavior Change: Web-Based Feasibility Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The rising incidence of chronic diseases is a growing concern, especially in Singapore, which is one of the high-income countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes. Interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes have been proven to be effective in reducing the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, but their in-person delivery may not be feasible on a large scale. Novel technologies such as conversational agents are a potential alternative for delivering behavioral interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes to the public.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using a conversational agent promoting healthy lifestyle behavior changes in the general population in Singapore.
   Methods: We performed a web-based, single-arm feasibility study. The participants were recruited through Facebook over 4 weeks. The Facebook Messenger conversational agent was used to deliver the intervention. The conversations focused on diet, exercise, sleep, and stress and aimed to promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes and improve the participants' knowledge of diabetes. Messages were sent to the participants four times a week (once for each of the 4 topics of focus) for 4 weeks. We assessed the feasibility of recruitment, defined as at least 75% (150/200) of our target sample of 200 participants in 4 weeks, as well as retention, defined as 33% (66/200) of the recruited sample completing the study. We also assessed the participants' satisfaction with, and usability of, the conversational agent. In addition, we performed baseline and follow-up assessments of quality of life, diabetes knowledge and risk perception, diet, exercise, sleep, and stress.
   Results: We recruited 37.5% (75/200) of the target sample size in 1 month. Of the 75 eligible participants, 60 (80%) provided digital informed consent and completed baseline assessments. Of these 60 participants, 56 (93%) followed the study through till completion. Retention was high at 93% (56/60), along with engagement, denoted by 50% (30/60) of the participants communicating with the conversational agent at each interaction. Acceptability, usability, and satisfaction were generally high. Preliminary efficacy of the intervention showed no definitive improvements in health-related behavior.
   Conclusions: The delivery of a conversational agent for healthy lifestyle behavior change through Facebook Messenger was feasible and acceptable. We were unable to recruit our planned sample solely using the free options in Facebook. However, participant retention and conversational agent engagement rates were high. Our findings provide important insights to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial.

TI  - Promoting Physical Activity Through Conversational Agents: Mixed Methods Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is crucial for well-being; however, healthy habits are difficult to create and maintain. Interventions delivered via conversational agents (eg, chatbots or virtual agents) are a novel and potentially accessible way to promote PA. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of research that uses conversational agents.
   Objective: This mixed methods systematic review aims to summarize the usability and effectiveness of conversational agents in promoting PA, describe common theories and intervention components used, and identify areas for further development.
   Methods: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review. We searched seven electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies that conveyed primary research on automated conversational agents designed to increase PA. The studies were independently screened, and their methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool by 2 reviewers. Data on intervention impact and effectiveness, treatment characteristics, and challenges were extracted and analyzed using parallel-results convergent synthesis and narrative summary.
   Results: In total, 255 studies were identified, 7.8% (20) of which met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was varied. Overall, conversational agents had moderate usability and feasibility. Those that were evaluated through randomized controlled trials were found to be effective in promoting PA. Common challenges facing interventions were repetitive program content, high attrition, technical issues, and safety and privacy concerns.
   Conclusions: Conversational agents hold promise for PA interventions. However, there is a lack of rigorous research on long-term intervention effectiveness and patient safety. Future interventions should be based on evidence-informed theories and treatment approaches and should address users' desires for program variety, natural language processing, delivery via mobile devices, and safety and privacy concerns.

TI  - Adapting a Persuasive Conversational Agent for the Chinese Culture
T2  - 2017 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CULTURE AND COMPUTING (CULTURE AND COMPUTING)
CP  - International Conference on Culture and Computing (Culture and Computing)
AB  - The design of an embodied conversational agent that promotes physical activity to young Chinese adults living in the United States is described, along with specific cultural adaptations performed to tailor the agent to Chinese culture. Results of a pilot study comparing the Chinese exercise coach agent to another adapted to American culture demonstrated that participants found the Chinese agent more interesting, but were more persuaded by the American agent to change their attitudes towards exercise. Overall, participants reported high levels of satisfaction with and trust in the agent, across both conditions. Qualitative analysis of interviews was carried out to examine participants' overall impression of the experience, and their perceptions of the cultural adaptations. We discuss possible explanations of our results, and propose future improvements for culturally adapted conversational agents, tailored to the Chinese community.

TI  - An Embodied Conversational Agent to Support Wellbeing After Injury: Insights from a Stakeholder Inclusive Design Approach
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2024
CP  - 19th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly being included in digital health and wellbeing programs. Whilst initial evaluations of ECAs in this field have been promising, there has been a lack of detail as to how stakeholders and end users have been included in the design process. Stakeholder inclusion has been acknowledged as essential to ensure that ECAs meet expectations, maximize engagement and facilitate behavior change. This study describes an iterative coproduction process used to develop an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) to support people following injury. The coproduction process followed an accelerated creation approach with 13 qualitative interviews being conducted with people who had a lived experience of recovering from injury/adversity. Interviews were completed with the goal to understand barriers and facilitators to engagement, user experience and to identify opportunities for program improvement. Four broad themes emerged from the data: visual look, voice, content and experience. A key finding from this study was a high level of stakeholder apprehension of generative AI and the need for ECA designers to make explicit the specific technology and functions being used within programs. Findings highlight the value of timely stakeholder inclusion in digital intervention design, particularly when knowledge and expectations of generative technology is rapidly changing.

TI  - Designing Supportive Conversational Agents With and For Teens
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2023 CONFERENCE ON HUMAN INFORMATION INTERACTION AND RETRIEVAL, CHIIR 2023
CP  - 8th Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval
AB  - The study involved adolescents (teens) in exploring the potential of conversational agents (CAs) to support adolescents during emotionally difficult times. During the online focus groups, participants were asked to talk about common problems they are experiencing and the conversational support they usually receive, design multi-turn supportive conversations that could be programmed into a CA, and offer recommendations for the features of supportive CAs for teens. Participants talked about stressful experiences that were reported in previous studies, i.e. school and family related problems, peer relationships, and self-image, suggesting that CAs can be programmed to anticipate and address stress/negative emotions related to these common stressors. In expressing preferences for conversational support, participants highlighted the importance of both cognitive (informational) and emotional dimensions in agents' responses. The findings point to the importance of developing CA content that offers teens advice on strategies to cope with negative emotion (advice on behavior change, self-care strategies), and also simply acknowledges their problems and lands an emotional "hearing ear".

TI  - Dialogue management in conversational agents through psychology of persuasion and machine learning
T2  - MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - To be really effective, conversational agents must integrate well with the characteristics of the humans with whom they interact. This exploratory study focuses on a method for integrating well-assessed methods from the field of social psychology in the design of task-oriented conversational agents in which the dialogue management module is developed through machine learning. In particular, the aim is to achieve agents whose policies could take into account the psychological features of the human interactants to deliver personalized and more effective messages. The paper presents the psychological study performed and outlines the overall theoretical architecture of the software framework proposed. On the psychosocial side, we first assessed the effectiveness of differently framed messages aimed to reducing red meat consumption taking the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the psychosocial model of reference. Turning to the machine learning field, the resulting Structural Equation Model (SEM) was first translated into a probabilistic predictor using Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In turn, such DBN became the fundamental element of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) in a reinforcement learning setting. The possibility to elicit complete interaction policies was then studied by applying Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (Neural MCTS) methods. The results thus obtained introduce the possibility to develop new multidisciplinary and integrated techniques for the development of automated dialogue managing systems.

TI  - Examining the persuasiveness of text and voice agents: prosody aligned with information structure increases human-likeness, perceived personalisation and brand attitude
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - To give product and brand recommendations, marketers make use of conversational agents which increasingly communicate via voice rather than text. Existing research comparing the persuasiveness of text and voice agents showed mixed results. The quality of the speech synthesis employed may strongly influence consumers' responses. This study investigates to what extent a voice agent with pragmatically aligned prosody is more persuasive (i.e. yields a more positive brand attitude) than an agent with a standard voice or text, and whether perceived human-likeness and perceived personalisation provide an underlying mechanism to explain these differences. In an experiment (n = 212), participants interacted with a conversational agent that recommended a camera. Results showed that a voice agent using prosody aligned to the information state of the user is more persuasive than a text agent. This effect is mediated by perceived human-likeness and perceived personalisation. Hence, aligned prosody can make synthetic speech meet a certain quality threshold to be perceived as more human-like. Theoretically, this study helps to unravel why conversational agents with human-like features are more persuasive.

TI  - Optimizing appreciation and persuasion of embodied conversational agents for health behavior change: A design experiment and focus group study
T2  - HEALTH INFORMATICS JOURNAL
AB  - Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) can increase user engagement and involvement and can strengthen the effect of an intervention on health outcomes that is provided via an ECA. However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of ECAs on health outcomes is still limited. In this article, we report on a study that has the goal to identify the effect of a match between a health topic and the ECAs' appearance on ratings of personality characteristics, persuasiveness and intention to use. We report on an online experiment with three different ECAs and three different health topics, conducted among 732 older adults. We triangulated the quantitative results with qualitative insights from a focus group. The results reveal that older adults prefer an ECA that has an appearance matching a certain health topic, resulting in higher ratings on persuasiveness and intention to use. Personality characteristics should be measured embedded within a health topic, but are not rated higher because of a match. We furthermore provide guidelines for designing the content of the ECA.

TI  - Exploring the Impact of Multimodal Long Conversations in VR on Attitudes Toward Behavior Change, Memory Retention, and Cognitive Load
T2  - COMPUTER ANIMATION AND VIRTUAL WORLDS
AB  - This study examines how multimodal communication strategies (subtitles, visualizations, and their combination), affect memory retention, attitudes toward behavior change, and cognitive load during long conversations (+20 min) in immersive virtual reality (VR). Using embodied conversational agents to educate participants on diabetes and healthy eating, we found that all conditions effectively improved memory retention and behavior change attitudes. However, the combination of multimodal strategies increased cognitive load, suggesting a trade-off between engagement and cognitive demands. These findings highlight the potential of long VR conversations for healthcare education, while emphasizing the importance of balancing cognitive demands and exploring personalization for diverse users.

T2  - ICMI '12: PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MULTIMODAL INTERACTION
CP  - 14th ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interaction (ICMI)
AB  - We present an empirical investigation of conversational behavior in dyadic interaction spanning multiple conversations, in the context of a developing interpersonal relationship between a health counselor and her clients. Using a longitudinal video corpus of behavior change counseling conversations, we show systematic changes in verbal and nonverbal behavior during greetings (within the first minute of conversations). Both the number of prior conversations and self-reported assessments of the strength of the interpersonal relationship are predictive of changes in verbal and nonverbal behavior.
   We present a model and implementation of nonverbal behavior generation for conversational agents that incorporates these findings, and discuss how the results can be applied to multimodal recognition of conversational behavior over time.

TI  - In Search of Embodied Conversational and Explainable Agents for Health Behaviour Change and Adherence
T2  - MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERACTION
AB  - Conversational agents offer promise to provide an alternative to costly and scarce access to human health providers. Particularly in the context of adherence to treatment advice and health behavior change, they can provide an ongoing coaching role to motivate and keep the health consumer on track. Due to the recognized importance of face-to-face communication and establishment of a therapist-patient working alliance as the biggest single predictor of adherence, our review focuses on embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and their use in health and well-being interventions. The article also introduces ECAs who provide explanations of their recommendations, known as explainable agents (XAs), as a way to build trust and enhance the working alliance towards improved behavior change. Of particular promise, is work in which XAs are able to engage in conversation to learn about their user and personalize their recommendations based on their knowledge of the user and then tailor their explanations to the beliefs and goals of the user to increase relevancy and motivation and address possible barriers to increase intention to perform the healthy behavior.

TI  - Persuasive Dialogue Based on a Narrative Theory: An ECA Implementation
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 5th International Conference on Persuasive Technology
AB  - Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) are poised to constitute a specific category within persuasive systems, in particular through their ability to support affective dialogue. One possible approach consists in using ECA as virtual coaches or personal assistants and to make persuasion part of a dialogue game implementing specific argumentation or negotiation features. In this paper, we explore an alternative framework, which emerges from the long-term development of ECA as "Companions" supporting free conversation with the user, rather than task-oriented dialogue. Our system aims at influencing user attitudes as part of free conversation, albeit on a limited set of topics. We describe the implementation of a Companion ECA to which the user reports on his working day, and which can assess the user's emotional attitude towards daily events in the office, trying to influence such attitude using affective strategies derived from a narrative model. This discussion is illustrated through examples from a first fully-implemented prototype.

TI  - Design Features of Embodied Conversational Agents in eHealth: a Literature Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are gaining interest to elicit user engagement and stimulate actual use of eHealth applications. In this literature review, we identify the researched design features for ECAs in eHealth, the outcome variables that were used to measure the effect of these design features and what the found effects for each variable were. Searches were performed in Scopus, ACM Digital Library, PsychINFO, Pubmed and IEEE Xplore Digital Library, resulting in 1284 identified articles of which 33 articles were included. The agents speech and/or textual output and its facial and gaze expressions were the most common design features. Little research was performed on the agent's looks. The measured effect of these design features was often on the perception of the agent's and user's characteristics, relation with the agent, system usage, intention to use, usability and behaviour change. Results show that emotion and relational behaviour seem to positively affect the perception of the agents characteristics and that relational behaviour also seems to positively affect the relation with the agent, usability and intention to use. However, these design features do not necessarily lead to behaviour change. This review showed that consensus on design features of ECAs in eHealth is far from established. Follow-up research should include more research on the effects of all design features, especially research on the effects in a long-term, daily life setting, and replication of studies on the effects of design features performed in other contexts than eHealth.

TI  - Effectiveness of embodied conversational agents for managing academic stress at an Indian University (ARU) during COVID-19
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students.

TI  - The Role of Choice and Customization on Users' Interaction with Embodied Conversational Agents: Effects on Perception and Performance
T2  - CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, VOLS 1 AND 2
CP  - Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
AB  - We performed an empirical study exploring people's interactions with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) while performing two tasks. Conditions varied with respect to 1) whether participants were allowed to choose an agent and its characteristics and 2) the putative quality or appropriateness of the agent for the tasks. For both tasks, selection combined with the illusion of further customization significantly improved participants' overall subjective impressions of the ECAs while putative quality had little or no effect. Additionally, performance data revealed that the ECA's motivation and persuasion effects were significantly enhanced when participants chose agents to use. We found that user expectations about and perceptions of the interaction between themselves and an ECA depended very much on the individual's preconceived notions and preferences of various ECA characteristics and might deviate greatly from the models that ECA designers intend to portray.

TI  - Exploring Design Opportunities for Reflective Conversational Agents to Reduce Compulsive Smartphone Use
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 5TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CONVERSATIONAL USER INTERFACES, CUI 2023
CP  - 5th International Conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)
AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recognizing the potential of CAs being persuasive agents, we are interested in leveraging CAs to reduce compulsive smartphone use, a widespread behavior among young adults that can lead to negative consequences. This work presents the design and development of StayFocused, a mobile app incorporating a chatbot to assist people in setting focus goals and reflecting on their phone-checking behaviors in situ. Particularly, we highlight the iterative process of curating prompts for GPT-3, and the lessons learned from our trials and errors. With StayFocused, we propose a three-week between-subjects study with college students. We envision the design of StayFocused and the proposed study will deepen our understanding of how CAs support immediate actions as well as sustained behavior change, and inform the design ofpersuasive technologies for reducing unintended behaviors such as compulsive smartphone use.

TI  - Automatic topic selection for long-term interaction with embodied conversational agents in health coaching: A micro-randomized trial
T2  - INTERNET INTERVENTIONS-THE APPLICATION OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY IN MENTAL AND BEHAVIOURAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) can be included in health coaching applications as virtual coaches. The engagement with these virtual coaches could be improved by presenting users with tailored coaching dialogues. In this article, we investigate if the suggestion of an automatically tailored topic by an ECA leads to higher engagement by the user and thus longer sessions of interaction.
   Methods: A Micro-Randomized Trial (MRT) was conducted in which two types of interaction with an ECA were compared: (a) the coach suggests a relevant topic to discuss, and (b) the coach asks the user to select a topic from a set of options. Every time the user would interact with the ECA, one of those conditions would be randomly selected. Participants interacted in their daily life with the ECA that was part of a multi-agent health coaching application for 4-8 weeks.
   Results: In two rounds, 82 participants interacted with the micro-randomized coach a total of 1011 times. Interactions in which the coach took the initiative were found to be of equal length as interactions in which the user was allowed to choose the topic, and the acceptance of topic suggestions was high (71.1% overall, 75.8% for coaching topics).
   Conclusion: Tailoring coaching conversations with ECAs by letting the coach automatically suggest a topic that is tailored to the user is perceived as a natural variation in the flow of interaction. Future research could focus on improving the novel coaching engine component that supports the topic selection process for these suggestions or on investigating how the amount of initiative and coaching approach by the ECA could be tailored.

TI  - Choice of Behavioral Change Techniques in Health Care Conversational Agents: Protocol for a Scoping Review
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Conversational agents or chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversations with users. Conversational agents are increasingly used for delivery of behavior change interventions in health care. Behavior change is complex and comprises the use of one or several components collectively known as behavioral change techniques (BCTs).
   Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to identify the BCTs that are used in behavior change-focused interventions delivered via conversational agents in health care.
   Methods: This scoping review will be performed in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and will be reported according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews guidelines. We will perform a comprehensive search of electronic databases and grey literature sources, and will check the reference lists of included studies for additional relevant studies. The screening and data extraction will be performed independently and in parallel by two review authors. Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or discussion with a third review author. We will use a data extraction form congruent with the key themes and aims of this scoping review. BCTs employed in the included studies will be coded in line with BCT Taxonomy v1. We will analyze the data qualitatively and present it in diagrammatic or tabular form, alongside a narrative summary.
   Results: To date, we have designed the search strategy and performed the search on April 26, 2021. The first round of screening of retrieved articles is planned to begin soon.
   Conclusions: Using appropriate BCTs in the design and delivery of health care interventions via conversational agents is essential to improve long-term outcomes. Our findings will serve to inform the development of future interventions in this area.

TI  - Effectiveness and acceptability of conversational agents for sexual health promotion: a systematic review and meta-analysis
T2  - SEXUAL HEALTH
AB  - Digital health interventions for sexual health promotion have evolved considerably alongside innovations in technology. Despite these efforts, studies have shown that they do not consistently result in the desired sexual health outcomes. This could be attributed to low levels of user engagement, which can hinder digital health intervention effectiveness, as users do not engage with the system enough to be exposed to the intervention components. It has been suggested that conversational agents (automated two-way communication systems e.g. Alexa) have the potential to overcome the limitations of prior systems and promote user engagement through the increased interactivity offered by bidirectional, natural language-based interactions. The present review, therefore, provides an overview of the effectiveness and user acceptability of conversational agents for sexual health promotion. A systematic search of seven databases provided 4534 records, and after screening, 31 articles were included in this review. A narrative synthesis of results was conducted for effectiveness and acceptability outcomes, with the former supplemented by a meta-analysis conducted on a subset of studies. Findings provide preliminary support for the effectiveness of conversational agents for promoting sexual health, particularly treatment adherence. These conversational agents were found to be easy to use and useful, and importantly, resulted in high levels of satisfaction, use and intentions to reuse, whereas user evaluations regarding the quality of information left room for improvement. The results can inform subsequent efforts to design and evaluate these interventions, and offer insight into additional user experience constructs identified outside of current technology acceptance models, which can be incorporated into future theoretical developments.

TI  - Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER): Development of a Conceptual Framework
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care. Methods: We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. Results: The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cuttingconsiderations-user-centered design and privacy and security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns.

TI  - That's a Rap Increasing Engagement with Rap Music Performance by Virtual Agents
T2  - INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2017
CP  - 17th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)
AB  - Many applications of virtual agents, including those in healthcare and education, require engaging users in dozens or hundreds of interactions over long periods of time. In this effort, we are developing conversational agents to engage young adults in longitudinal lifestyle health behavior change interventions. Hip-hop and rap are one of the most popular genres of music among our stakeholders, and we are exploring rap as an engagement mechanism and communication channel in our agent-based interventions. We describe a method for integrating rap into a counseling dialog by a conversational agent, including the acoustic manipulation of synthetic speech and accompanying character dance animation. We demonstrate in a within-subjects study that the participants who like rap music preferred the rapping character significantly more than an equivalent agent that does not rap in its dialog, based on both self-report and behavioral measures. Participants also found the rapping agent significantly more engaging than the non-rapping one.

TI  - Effects of personalization and social role in voice shopping: An experimental study on product recommendation by a conversational voice agent
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - This study examines the persuasion mechanism in product recommendations made by a voice-based conversational agent and explores whether the personalized content reflecting the customer's preferences and the agent's social role of a friend, rather than a secretary, generate a more positive attitude toward the product in the context of voice shopping. With the framework of dual modes of information-processing models, we hypothesized that the personalization of messages would be a central mute with a greater impact on attitude for products with high involvement. By contrast, the social role of the conversational agent was expected to represent a peripheral route with a greater impact on products with low involvement. An experimental study was designed to test the effects of personalized content that reflected individual preferences for product attributes and a friend role of a voice agent with high and low product involvement. The results showed main effects of both personalization and the social role on building attitudes toward the product. Although no interaction effect for personalization and involvement was found, there was a significant interaction effect for the social role and involvement. This study contributes to persuasion theory by extending it to the interaction with a conversational agent. For practitioners, the study provides insights into the importance of the personalized content of recommendations and the need for consideration of an alternative social role in the design of voice shopping through a conversational agent.

TI  - 'Let UsWork Together'- Insights from an Experiment with Conversational Agents on the Relation of Anthropomorphic Design, Dialog Support, and Performance
T2  - INNOVATION THROUGH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, VOL II: A COLLECTION OF LATEST RESEARCH ON TECHNOLOGY ISSUES
CP  - 16th International Conference on Business and Information Systems Engineering (WI)
AB  - In the human interaction with CAs, research has shown that elements of persuasive system design, such as praise, are perceived differently when compared to traditional graphical interfaces.
   In this experimental study, we will extend our knowledge regarding the relation of persuasiveness (namely dialog support), anthropomorphically designed CAs, and task performance. Within a three-conditions-between-subjects design, two instances of the CA are applied within an online experiment with 120 participants. Our results show that anthropomorphically designed CAs increase perceived dialog support and performance but adding persuasive design elements can be counterproductive. Thus, the results are embedded in the discourse of CA design for task support.

TI  - Raising Awareness of Smartphone Overuse among University Students: A Persuasive Systems Approach
T2  - INFORMATICS-BASEL
AB  - Smartphone overuse can lead to a series of physical, mental and social disturbances. This problem is more prevalent among young adults as compared to other demographic groups. Additionally, university students are already undergoing high cognitive loads and stress conditions; therefore, they are more susceptible to smartphone addiction and its derived problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach where a conversational mobile agent uses persuasive messages exploring the reflective mind to raise users' awareness of their usage and consequently induce reduction behaviors. We conducted a four-week study with 16 university students undergoing stressful conditions-a global lockdown during their semester-and evaluated the impact of the agent on smartphone usage reduction and the perceived usefulness of such an approach. Results show the efficacy of self-tracking in the behavior change process: 81% of the users reduced their usage time, and all of them mentioned that having a conversational agent alerting them about their usage was useful. Before this experiment, only 68% of them considered such an approach could be useful. In conclusion, users deemed it essential to have an engaging conversational agent on their smartphones, in terms of helping them become more aware of usage times.

TI  - Hmm, the effect of AI conversational fillers on consumer purchase intentions
T2  - MARKETING LETTERS
AB  - AI conversational agents are increasingly prevalent in marketing practices. A recent effort to make AI conversational agents humanlike is the use of conversational fillers, such as uh, um, and hmm. While computer science research has shown that conversational fillers used by AI agents generally improve users' interactional experiences, their effects in marketing remain unexplored. This research examines AI conversational fillers in a sales and promotion context and shows that they trigger consumers' suspicion of ulterior motives, thereby decreasing their purchase intentions, an effect moderated by organization type (for-profit vs. nonprofit). We conducted one field experiment and four online experiments with different modalities, products, and languages to provide empirical support for the hypotheses. In so doing, this research contributes to the research on chatbot natural language and AI persuasion by showing that the persuasion knowledge model can come into work in consumers' interaction with AI agents.

TI  - Sequencing conversational turns in peer interactions: An integrated approach for evidence-based conversational agent for just-in-time nicotine cravings intervention
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Background Risky health behaviors place an enormous toll on public health systems. While relapse prevention support is integrated with most behavior modification programs, the results are suboptimal. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) applications provide us with unique opportunities to develop just-in-time adaptive behavior change solutions.Methods In this study, we present an innovative framework, grounded in behavioral theory, and enhanced with social media sequencing and communications scenario builder to architect a conversational agent (CA) specialized in the prevention of relapses in the context of tobacco cessation. We modeled peer interaction data (n = 1000) using the taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) and speech act (SA) theory to uncover the socio-behavioral and linguistic context embedded within the online social discourse. Further, we uncovered the sequential patterns of BCTs and SAs from social conversations (n = 339,067). We utilized grounded theory-based techniques for extracting the scenarios that best describe individuals' needs and mapped them into the architecture of the virtual CA.Results The frequently occurring sequential patterns for BCTs were comparison of behavior and feedback and monitoring; for SAs were directive and assertion. Five cravings-related scenarios describing users' needs as they deal with nicotine cravings were identified along with the kinds of behavior change constructs that are being elicited within those scenarios.Conclusions AI-led virtual CAs focusing on behavior change need to employ data-driven and theory-linked approaches to address issues related to engagement, sustainability, and acceptance. The sequential patterns of theory and intent manifestations need to be considered when developing effective behavior change CAs.

TI  - Usability Testing of a Social Media Chatbot for Increasing Physical Activity Behavior
T2  - JOURNAL OF PERSONALIZED MEDICINE
AB  - Digital interventions for increasing physical activity behavior have shown great potential, especially those with social media. Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, have emerged in healthcare in relation to digital interventions and have proven effective in promoting physical activity among adults. The study's objective is to explore users' experiences with a social media chatbot. The concept and the prototype development of the social media chatbot MYA were realized in three steps: requirement analysis, concept development, and implementation. MYA's design includes behavior change techniques effective in increasing physical activity through digital interventions. Participants in a usability study answered a survey with the Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ), which is comparable to the Systems Usability Scale. The mean CUQ score was below 68, the benchmark for average usability. The highest mean CUQ score was 64.5 for participants who thought MYA could help increase their physical activity behavior. The lowest mean CUQ score was 40.6 for participants aged between 50 and 69 years. Generally, MYA was considered to be welcoming, very easy to use, realistic, engaging, and informative. However, some technical issues were identified. A good and diversified user experience promotes prolonged chatbot use. Addressing identified issues will enhance users' interaction with MYA.

AB  - Work towards the development of a "wearable conscience" that helps individuals make healthy decisions in their everyday lives is described. To be effective, such a system must be portable, sense key elements of the user's environment, have knowledge of counseling and health behavior change techniques, be able to effectively communicate with the user, and have social competencies for maintaining an ongoing working relationship. The design of a prototype system is presented, along with results from a series of design and usability studies. Current and future directions for the research are also discussed.

TI  - A Virtual Conversational Agent for Teens with Autism Spectrum Disorder: Experimental Results and Design Lessons
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS (ACM IVA 2020)
CP  - 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (ACM IVA)
AB  - We present the design of an online social skills development interface for teenagers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The interface is intended to enable private conversation practice anywhere, anytime using a web-browser. Users converse informally with a virtual agent, receiving feedback on nonverbal cues in real-time, and summary feedback. The prototype was developed in consultation with an expert UX designer, two psychologists, and a pediatrician. Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility.

TI  - Modelling Therapeutic Alliance using a User-aware Explainable Embodied Conversational Agent to Promote Treatment Adherence
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 19TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS (IVA' 19)
CP  - 19th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)
AB  - Non-adherence to a treatment plan recommended by the therapist is a key cause of the increasing rate of chronic medical conditions globally. The therapist-patient therapeutic alliance is regarded as a successful intervention and a good predictor of treatment adherence. Similar to the human scenario, embodied conversational agents (ECAs) showed evidence of their ability to build an agent-patient therapeutic alliance, which motivates the effort to advance ECAs as a potential solution to improve treatment adherence and consequently the health outcome. Building therapeutic alliance implies the need for a positive environment where the ECA and the patient can share their knowledge and discuss their goals, preferences and tasks towards building a shared plan, which is commonly done using explanations. However, explainable agents commonly rely on their own knowledge and goals in providing explanations, rather than the beliefs, plans or goals of the user. It is not clear whether such explanations, in individual-specific contexts such as personal health assistance, are perceived by the user as relevant in decision making towards their own behavior change. Therefore, in this research, we are developing a user-aware explainable ECA by embedding the cognitive agent architecture with a user model, explanation engine and modified planner to implement the concept of SharedPlans. The developed agent will be deployed and evaluated with real patients and the therapeutic alliance will be measured using standard measurements.

TI  - Coerced Change-talk with Conversational Agents Promotes Confidence in Behavior Change
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 13TH EAI INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON PERVASIVE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGIES FOR HEALTHCARE (PERVASIVEHEALTH 2019)
CP  - 13th EAI International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth)
AB  - Motivational interviewing is a counseling technique that works, in part, by helping people talk about changing their behavior. We describe two conversational agent-based interventions to increase motivation and confidence to promote physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption that incorporate principles from motivational interviewing. We also explore the efficacy of constraining input, so users are only allowed to express change talk in their conversation with the agent. In a within-subjects experiment we demonstrate that both interventions are effective at increasing motivation, confidence, and self-efficacy for behavior change during a single counseling session. We also demonstrate that coercing user change talk leads to significantly greater increases in confidence compared to equivalent counseling agents that allow users to express statements about not changing their behavior.

TI  - Short and Long-Term Innovations on Dietary Behavior Assessment and Coaching: Present Efforts and Vision of the Pride and Prejudice Consortium
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors, including diet, have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However, as shown by numerous studies, and in clinical practice, it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of 'one-size-fits-all' nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation, the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life, nutrition, ICT, design, behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology. P&P focuses on the development and integration of innovative technological techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, conversational agents, behavior change theory and personalized coaching to improve current practices and establish lasting dietary behavior change.

TI  - Use and Effect of Web-Based Embodied Conversational Agents for Improving Eating Behavior and Decreasing Loneliness Among Community-Dwelling Older Adults: Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: An unhealthy eating pattern and loneliness negatively influence quality of life in older age. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are a promising way to address these health behaviors in an engaging manner.
   Objective: We aim to (1) identify whether ECAs can persuade community-dwelling older adults to change their dietary behavior and whether ECA use can decrease loneliness, (2) test these pathways to effects, and (3) understand the use of an ECA.
   Methods: The web-based eHealth app PACO is a fully automated 8-week intervention in which 2 ECAs engage older adults in dialogue to motivate them to change their dietary behavior and decrease their loneliness. PACO was developed via a human-centered and stakeholder-inclusive design approach and incorporates Self-determination Theory and various behavior change techniques. For this study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial will be performed. There will be 2 cohorts, with 30 participants per cohort. Participants in the first cohort will immediately receive the PACO app for 8 weeks, while participants in the second cohort receive the PACO app after a waiting-list condition of 4 weeks. Participants will be recruited via social media, an online panel, flyers, and advertorials. To be eligible, participants must be at least 65 years of age, must not be in paid employment, and must live alone independently at home. Primary outcomes will be self-assessed via online questionnaires at intake, control, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks, and will include eating behavior and loneliness. In addition, the primary outcome-use-will be measured via data logs. Secondary outcomes will be measured at the same junctures, via either validated, self-assessed, online questionnaires or an optional interview.
   Results: As of July 2020, we have begun recruiting participants.
   Conclusions: By unraveling the mechanisms behind the use of a web-based intervention with ECAs, we hope to gain a fine-grained understanding of both the effectiveness and the use of ECAs in the health context.

TI  - Promotion of Preconception Care Among Adolescents and Young Adults by Conversational Agent
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADOLESCENT HEALTH
AB  - Purpose: Preconception care is important for all women to improve infant and maternal health outcomes and may be especially important for adolescents and young adults. This study assesses the acceptance, usability, and use of an automated intervention to screen women on 108 preconception care risks and address them over the course of a year via a Web-based virtual animated health counselor and compares these measures for the adolescent and young adult users aged 18-25 years with those of users aged 26-34 years. We hypothesize that the younger cohort will have significantly greater use of and satisfaction with the online intervention.
   Methods: A randomized controlled trial involving a national sample of 528 women was conducted. We present a secondary data analysis on the system use and self-reported usability and satisfaction of the 79 women aged 18-25 years randomized to the intervention group, compared with the 183 women aged 26-34 years in the intervention group. Participants were required to self-identify as female, black or African American, aged 18-34 years, not pregnant, and English-speaking and were recruited through a variety of advertisements and outreach activities.
   Results: Of the adolescent and young adult participants (aged 18-25 years) enrolled and randomized to the intervention, 20.25% of participants accessed the system 0 times; 29.11%, 1-3 times; and 50.63%, >3 times over the course of a year. At the end of the year, almost all (96.4%) indicated they had either acted on recommendations made by the agent or planned to. Most (75.0%) said they would recommend the system to someone they knew. There were no significant differences between the two age groups on intervention use or satisfaction.
   Conclusions: Web-based conversational agents are a viable medium for delivering longitudinal preconception care counseling to adolescents and young adults.

TI  - Promoting Physical Activity in Older Adults With Type 2 Diabetes via an Anthropomorphic Conversational Agent: Development of an Evidence and Theory-Based Multi-Behavior Intervention
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionAnthropomorphic conversational agents (ACA) are a promising digital tool to support self-management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), albeit little explored. There is a dearth of literature on the detailed content of these interventions, which may limit effectiveness and replication. Our aim is to describe the development of an evidence and theory-based intervention to improve physical activity in older adults with T2D, subsumed in a multi-behavior intervention via a mobile application with an ACA. MethodsOverall decisions on the multi-behavior intervention design, such as the use of standardized behavior change techniques (BCTTv1), guided the development of the physical activity component. Firstly, recommendations on ambulatory activity were used to select the target behavior (walking). Meta-research on effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) was then identified. One meta-analysis linked effective BCTs with the three basic psychological needs of the self-determination theory (SDT). This meta-analysis, taken together with additional evidence on SDT, led to the selection of this theory to inform the design. BCTs were extracted from meta-research; we selected the most appropriate to be operationalized via the conversational agent through multidisciplinary discussions. Rules governing the dialogue flow and BCTs tailoring, taking the form "if some conditions hold then execute some action," were derived based on the Basic Psychological in Exercise Scale (competence, autonomy, and relatedness scores), in conjunction with published evidence and multidisciplinary discussions. ResultsThirteen BCTs were implemented in the prototype via the ACA (e.g., goal setting behavior 1.1). Six if-then rules were derived and depicted in the dialogue steps through process flow diagrams, which map how the system functions. An example of a rule is "If competence score <= 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 500 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal; If competence score > 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 1,000 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal." ConclusionEvidence and SDT were translated into a mobile application prototype using an ACA to promote physical activity in older adults with T2D. This approach, which includes 13 BCTs and six if-then rules for their tailoring, may leverage the efforts of others in developing similar interventions.

T2  - 2024 33RD IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ROBOT AND HUMAN INTERACTIVE COMMUNICATION, ROMAN 2024
CP  - 33rd IEEE International Conference on Robot and Human Interactive Communication (IEEE RO-MAN) - Embracing Human-Centered HRI
AB  - This study investigates how the level of physical anthropomorphism in conversational agents affects their persuasiveness. The experiment compared robots with low and high levels of anthropomorphism, akin to human appearance. Results indicated that while sophisticated physical embodiment did not universally enhance persuasiveness, it did have an interaction effect based on issue involvement. For low involvement issues, persuasiveness increased with higher anthropomorphism. In contrast, for high involvement issues, persuasiveness remained constant across different levels of anthropomorphism but dropped when robots closely resembled humans, possibly due to trust in high-tech robots. The findings highlight the importance of digital agent's persuasive power and ethics in employing and designing robots.

TI  - Developing Embodied Conversational Agents for Coaching People in a Healthy Lifestyle: Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are animated computer characters that simulate face-to-face counseling. Owing to their capacity to establish and maintain an empathic relationship, they are deemed to be a promising tool for starting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
   Objective: This review aimed to identify the current practices in designing and evaluating ECAs for coaching people in a healthy lifestyle and provide an overview of their efficacy (on behavioral, knowledge, and motivational parameters) and use (on usability, usage, and user satisfaction parameters).
   Methods: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. PsycINFO, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, and Scopus were searched with a combination of terms related to ECA and lifestyle. Initially, 1789 unique studies were identified; 20 studies were included.
   Results: Most often, ECAs targeted physical activity (n=16) and had the appearance of a middle-aged African American woman (n=13). Multiple behavior change techniques (median=3) and theories or principles (median=3) were applied, but their interpretation and application were usually not reported. ECAs seemed to be designed for the end user rather than with the end user. Stakeholders were usually not involved. A total of 7 out of 15 studies reported better efficacy outcomes for the intervention group, and 5 out of 8 studies reported better use-related outcomes, as compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: ECAs are a promising tool for persuasive communication in the health domain This review provided valuable insights into the current developmental processes, and it recommends the use of human-centered, stakeholder-inclusive design approaches, along with reporting on the design activities in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The gaps in knowledge were identified on the working mechanisms of intervention components and the right timing and frequency of coaching.

TI  - Persuasive Conversational Agent with Persuasion Tactics
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 5th International Conference on Persuasive Technology
AB  - Persuasive conversational agents persuade people to change their attitudes or behaviors through conversation, and are expected to be applied as virtual sales clerks in e-shopping sites. As an approach to create such an agent, we have developed a learning agent with the Wizard of Oz method in which a person called Wizard talks to the user pretending to be the agent. The agent observes the conversations between the Wizard and the user, and learns how to persuade people. In this method, the Wizard has to reply to most of the user's inputs at the beginning, but the burden gradually falls because the agent learns how to reply as the conversation model grows.
   Generally speaking, persuasion tactics is important to persuade people efficiently, but it is also useful to reduce the burden of the Wizard because it guides the Wizard to a way of persuasion. In this paper, we explicitly implement persuasion tactics into the persuasive conversation agent. Evaluation experiments show that the burden (the input ratio) of the Wizard was reduced from 55% (without tactics) to 33% (with tactics), although the success ratio of persuasion was little improved.

TI  - Automated interventions for multiple health behaviors using conversational agents
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
AB  - Objective: An automated health counselor agent was designed to promote both physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption through a series of simulated conversations with users on their home computers.
   Methods: The agent was evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact intervention comparing: (a) physical activity; (b) fruit and vegetable consumption; (c) both interventions; and (d) a non-intervention control. Physical activity was assessed using daily pedometer steps. Daily servings of fruit and vegetables were assessed using the NIH/NCI self-report Fruit and Vegetable Scan.
   Results: Participants in the physical activity intervention increased their walking on average compared to the control group, while those in the fruit and vegetable intervention and combined intervention decreased walking. Participants in the fruit and vegetable intervention group consumed significantly more servings per day compared to those in the control group, and those in the combined intervention reported consuming more compared to those in the control group.
   Conclusion: Automated health intervention software designed for efficient re-use is effective at changing health behavior.
   Practice implications: Automated health behavior change interventions can be designed to facilitate translation and adaptation across multiple behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - A Chatbot-Delivered Stress Management Coaching for Students (MISHA App): Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Globally, students face increasing mental health challenges, including elevated stress levels and declining well-being, leading to academic performance issues and mental health disorders. However, due to stigma and symptom underestimation, students rarely seek effective stress management solutions. Conversational agents in the health sector have shown promise in reducing stress, depression, and anxiety. Nevertheless, research on their effectiveness for students with stress remains limited. Objective: This study aims to develop a conversational agent-delivered stress management coaching intervention for students called MISHA and to evaluate its effectiveness, engagement, and acceptance. Methods: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, Swiss students experiencing stress were recruited on the web. Using a 1:1 randomization ratio, participants (N=140) were allocated to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Treatment effectiveness on changes in the primary outcome, that is, perceived stress, and secondary outcomes, including depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and active coping, were self-assessed and evaluated using ANOVA for repeated measure and general estimating equations. Results: The per-protocol analysis revealed evidence for improvement of stress, depression, and somatic symptoms with medium effect sizes (Cohen d=-0.36 to Cohen d=-0.60), while anxiety and active coping did not change (Cohen d=-0.29 and Cohen d=0.13). In the intention-to-treat analysis, similar results were found, indicating reduced stress (beta estimate=-0.13, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.05; P<.001), depressive symptoms (beta estimate=-0.23, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.08; P=.003), and psychosomatic symptoms (beta estimate=-0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.06; P=.003), while anxiety and active coping did not change. Overall, 60% (42/70) of the participants in the intervention group completed the coaching by completing the postintervention survey. They particularly appreciated the quality, quantity, credibility, and visual representation of information. While individual customization was rated the lowest, the target group fitting was perceived as high. Conclusions: Findings indicate that MISHA is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing perceived stress among students in Switzerland. Future research is needed with different populations, for example, in students with high stress levels or compared to active controls.

TI  - Conversational Agents in Health Care: Scoping Review of Their Behavior Change Techniques and Underpinning Theory
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used in health care to deliver behavior change interventions. Their evaluation often includes categorizing the behavior change techniques (BCTs) using a classification system of which the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) is one of the most common. Previous studies have presented descriptive summaries of behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, but no in-depth study reporting the use of BCTs in these interventions has been published to date.
   Objective: This review aims to describe behavior change interventions delivered by CAs and to identify the BCTs and theories guiding their design.
   Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the first 10 pages of Google and Google Scholar in April 2021. We included primary, experimental studies evaluating a behavior change intervention delivered by a CA. BCTs coding followed the BCTTv1. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. Descriptive analysis and frequent itemset mining to identify BCT clusters were performed.
   Results: We included 47 studies reporting on mental health (n=19, 40%), chronic disorders (n=14, 30%), and lifestyle change (n=14, 30%) interventions. There were 20/47 embodied CAs (43%) and 27/47 CAs (57%) represented a female character. Most CAs were rule based (34/47, 72%). Experimental interventions included 63 BCTs, (mean 9 BCTs; range 2-21 BCTs), while comparisons included 32 BCTs (mean 2 BCTs; range 2-17 BCTs). Most interventions included BCTs 4.1 "Instruction on how to perform a behavior" (34/47, 72%), 3.3 "Social support" (emotional; 27/47, 57%), and 1.2 "Problem solving" (24/47, 51%). A total of 12/47 studies (26%) were informed by a behavior change theory, mainly the Transtheoretical Model and the Social Cognitive Theory. Studies using the same behavior change theory included different BCTs.
   Conclusions: There is a need for the more explicit use of behavior change theories and improved reporting of BCTs in CA interventions to enhance the analysis of intervention effectiveness and improve the reproducibility of research.

TI  - Delivering Green Persuasion Strategies with a Conversational Agent: a Pilot Study
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 57TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
CP  - 57th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
AB  - Climate change is undeniable. The drastic consequences it may have on our lives make a collective effort crucial. Our research explores how Conversational Agents (CAs) can persuade people into environmentally sustainable behaviors, particularly in domestic spaces where these technologies are becoming increasingly popular. In this research work, we conducted an empirical evaluation (N=29) exploring the effectiveness and stance towards the adoption of different persuasive strategies compared to a CA delivering messages referring to just one persuasion strategy. Furthermore, this contribution reports on a custom dialogue manager's implementation, designed to enable the execution of the experiment. Although study results suggested no significant difference in persuasion effectiveness and usability of the conversational agents, participants reported a significant difference in the perceptions of parasocial interactions and dialogue with the CA, preferring the one delivering multiple persuasive strategies.

TI  - Logic-based cognitive planning for conversational agents
T2  - AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to cognitive planning based on an NP-complete logic of explicit and implicit belief whose satisfiability checking problem is reduced to SAT. We illustrate the potential for application of our model by formalizing and then implementing a human-machine interaction scenario in which an artificial agent interacts with a human agent through dialogue and tries to motivate her to practice a sport. To make persuasion effective, the artificial agent needs a model of the human's beliefs and desires which is built during interaction through a sequence of belief revision operations. We consider two cognitive planning algorithms and compare their performances, a brute force algorithm based on SAT and a QBF-based algorithm.

TI  - Virtual Coaches for Older Adults' Wellbeing: A Systematic Review
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Virtual Coaches, also known as e-coaches, are a disruptive technology in healthcare. Indeed, among other usages, they might provide cost-effective solutions for increasing human wellbeing in different domains, such as physical, nutritional, cognitive, social, and emotional. This paper presents a systematic review of virtual coaches specifically aimed at improving or maintaining older adults' health in the aforementioned domains. Such digital systems assume various forms, from classic apps, to more advanced conversational agents or robots. Fifty-six articles describing a virtual coach for older adults and aimed at improving their wellbeing were identified and further analyzed. In particular, we presented how previous studies defined their virtual coaches, which behavioral change models and techniques they adopted and the overall system architecture, in terms of monitoring solutions, processing methods and modalities for intervention delivery. Our results show that few thorough evaluations of e-coaching systems have been conducted, especially regarding multi-domain coaching approaches. Through our analysis, we identified the wellbeing domains that should be addressed in future studies as well as the most promising behavior change models and techniques and coaching interfaces. Previous work illustrates that older adults often appreciate conversational agents and robots. However, the lack of a multidomain intervention approach in the current literature motivates us to seek to define future solutions.

TI  - Don't Walk Between Us: Adherence to Social Conventions When Joining a Small Conversational Group of Agents
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2022
CP  - 22nd ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)
AB  - When modeling life-like Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), conveying politeness through verbal and nonverbal behaviors with persuasive intents is a significant challenge, as it underlies the conventional set of behavioral rules that govern human communication. In the present study, we explore the adherence to such rules in the context of joining a small, freestanding conversational group of agents in VR. In particular, we focus on the behavior adopted by participants while walking towards the agents, and on whether ECAs were treated in the same way human agents normally are. 45 test subjects were invited by an ECA to walk towards the group by applying one of six possible politeness strategies; after freely joining the group, they were asked to rate the agent's politeness according to four distinct aspects (Clarity, Face loss, Positive face, and Negative face). Across all strategies, in 48% of the trials participants were successfully persuaded to join the group at an inconvenient location. Out of those trials, participants adhered to social conventions by not crossing the convex empty space between the group members (o-space) in 75% of them on average. Additionally, analysis of verbal and nonverbal behaviors in ECAs shows that direct request strategies are more effective than indirect ones, although in some cases they may be perceived as less polite.

TI  - Developing a Question Corpus for a Conversational Agent Designed to Prepare Interested Black Undergraduates for the Professoriate in STEM
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2019 RESEARCH ON EQUITY AND SUSTAINED PARTICIPATION IN ENGINEERING, COMPUTING, AND TECHNOLOGY (RESPECT)
CP  - 4th Conference on Research on Equity and Sustained Participation in Engineering, Computing, and Technology (RESPECT)
AB  - To increase the number of African Americans in the highly demanding computing field, a conversational agent is being developed, serving as a supplemental virtual mentor for Black students pursuing the professoriate in engineering or computing. As data on the interest of Black undergraduates in pursuing the engineering and computing professoriate is limited in the literature, it is important to identify the level of interest, factors that contribute to, and questions Black students have about pursuing the professoriate. A survey was administered to undergraduate students at an HBCU enrolled in one of three computer science courses. The results identify levels of likelihood, persuasion and discouragement themes, as well as frequently asked questions over several variables for pursuing the professoriate in STEM as an African American. Questions and data on question type, grammar, syntax and word choice will be used to improve the knowledge database of the virtual mentor.

TI  - Response to a relational agent by hospital patients with depressive symptoms
T2  - INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS
AB  - Depression affects approximately 15% of the US population, and is recognized as an important risk factor for poor outcomes among patients with various illnesses. Automated health education and behavior change programs have the potential to help address many of the shortcomings in health care. However, the role of these systems in the care of patients with depression has been insufficiently examined. In the current study, we sought to evaluate how hospitalized medical patients would respond to a computer animated conversational agent that has been developed to provide information in an empathic fashion about a patient's hospital discharge plan. In particular, we sought to examine how patients who have a high level of depressive symptoms respond to this system. Therapeutic alliance - the trust and belief that a patient and provider have in working together to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome - was used as the primary outcome measure, since it has been shown to be important in predicting outcomes across a wide range of health problems, including depression. In an evaluation of 139 hospital patients who interacted with the agent at the time of discharge, all patients, regardless of depressive symptoms, rated the agent very high on measures of satisfaction and ease of use, and most preferred receiving their discharge information from the agent compared to their doctors or nurses in the hospital. In addition, we found that patients with symptoms indicative of major depression rated the agent significantly higher on therapeutic alliance compared to patients who did not have major depressive symptoms. We conclude that empathic agents represent a promising technology for patient assessment, education and counseling for those most in need of comfort and caring in the inpatient setting.

TI  - Features for Culturally Appropriate Avatars for Behavior-Change Promotion in At-Risk Populations
T2  - ANNUAL REVIEW OF CYBERTHERAPY AND TELEMEDICINE 2009: ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES IN THE BEHAVIORAL, SOCIAL AND NEUROSCIENCES
AB  - We explore how avatars can be used as social orthotics defined as therapeutic computer-based social companions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors. We review some of the health interventions deployed in helping at-risk populations along with some of the unique advantages that computer-based interventions can add to face-to-face interventions. We posit that artificial intelligence has rendered possible the creation of culturally appropriate dialog-agents for interventions and we identify specific features for social avatars that are important - if not necessary - when applied to the domain of social orthotic systems for health promotion.

TI  - "Hey Genie, You Got Me Thinking about My Menu Choices!" Impact of Proactive Feedback on User Perception and Reflection in Decision-making Tasks
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTER-HUMAN INTERACTION
AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) that deliver proactive interventions can benefit users by reducing their cognitive workload and improving performance. However, little is known regarding how such interventions would impact users' reflection on choices in voice-only decision-making tasks. We conducted a within-subjects experiment to evaluate the effect of CA's feedback delivery strategy at three levels (no feedback, unsolicited and solicited feedback) and the impact on users' likelihood of changing their choices in an interactive food ordering scenario. We discovered that in both feedback conditions the CA was perceived to be significantly more persuasive than in the baseline condition, while being perceived as significantly less confident. Interestingly, while unsolicited feedback was perceived as less appropriate than the baseline, both types of proactive feedback led participants to relisten and reconsider menu options significantly more often. Our results provide insights regarding the impact of proactive feedback on CA perception and user's reflection in decision-making tasks, thereby paving a new way for designing proactive CAs.

TI  - Can a monologue-style ECA more effectively motivate eHealth users in initial distress than textual guidance?
T2  - HELIYON
AB  - Stress is a prevalent issue amongst patients with chronic conditions. As eHealth interventions are gaining importance, it becomes more relevant to invoke the possibilities from the eHealth technology itself to provide motivational acts during experiences of stress as to enhance adherence to the intervention. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA's) also known as 'robots on screen' can potentially provide a remedy. Within our eHealth experiment we applied a between-subjects design and experimentally studied the difference in appraisal of motivation and guidance. We deployed a functionally modest, monologue-style ECA and compared them with textual guidance. This way, we filtered out the considerable positive impact of interactive features that go along with dialogue-style ECA's. The study was carried out amongst eHealth users of which half were deliberately put in a stressful pre-condition. The rationale was two-sided; first, we hypothesized that it would induce a need for motivational support. Second, it would provide a fair representation of eHealth users in real life. Furthermore, we investigated hypothesized positive effects from a gender match between participant and ECA. The results demonstrated preferential ECA effects compared to text but only in the no stress conditions. Although our set-up controlled for user distraction by putting the facilitating ECA in a pane separate from the eHealth environment, we suspect that the enduring visual presence of the ECA during task completion had still inhibited distressed users. Discussing this phenomenon, our stance is that the hypothesis that ECA support is always superior to textual guidance is open for re-evaluation. Text may sometimes serve users equally well because it lacks human-like aspects that in stressful circumstances can become confrontational. We discuss the potential of ECA's to motivate, but also elaborate on the caveats. Further implications for the ECA, intervention adherence, and eHealth study fields are discussed in relation to stress.

TI  - An Angle-Oriented Approach to Transferring Speech to Gesture for Highly Anthropomorphized Embodied Conversational Agents
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - Realistic co-speech gestures are important to anthropomorphize ECAs, as nonverbal behavior improves expressiveness of their speech greatly. However, the existing approaches to generating co-speech gestures with sufficient details (including fingers, etc.) in 3D scenarios are indeed rare. Additionally, they hardly address the problem of abnormal gestures, temporal-spatial coherence and diversity of gesture sequences comprehensively. To handle abnormal gesture issues, we put forward an angle conversion method to remove body part length from the original in-the-wild video dataset via transferring coordinates of human upper body key points into relative deflection angles and pitch angles. We also propose a neural network called HARP with encoder-decoder architecture to transfer MFCC featured speech audio into aforementioned angles on the basis of CNN and LSTM. The angles then can be rendered as corresponding co-speech gestures. Compared with the other latest approaches, the co-speech gestures generated by HARP are proved to be almost as good as the real person, i.e., they have strong temporal-spatial coherence, diversity, persuasiveness and credibility. Our approach puts finer control on co-speech gestures than most of the existing works by handling all key points of the human upper body. It is more feasible for industrial application, since HARP can be adaptive to any human upper body model. All related code and evidence videos of HARP can be accessed at https://github.com/drrobincroft/HARP.

TI  - A Randomized Controlled Trial of an Automated Exercise Coach for Older Adults
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN GERIATRICS SOCIETY
AB  - ObjectivesTo compare the efficacy of a computer-based physical activity program (Embodied Conversational AgentECA) with that of a pedometer control condition in sedentary older adults.
   DesignSingle-blind block-randomized controlled trial stratified according to clinic site and health literacy status.
   SettingThree urban ambulatory care practices at Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September 2011.
   ParticipantsOlder adults (N=263; mean age 71.3; 61% female; 63% African American; 51% high school diploma or less).
   InterventionECA participants were provided with portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for 2months and were directed to connect their pedometers to the computer using a data cable and interact with a computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 10months. Control participants were given a control pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants were also provided with pedometers.
   MeasurementsThe primary outcome was average daily step count for the 30days before the 12-month interview. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count for the 30days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes were also stratified according to health literacy level.
   ResultsECA participants walked significantly more steps than control participants at 2months (adjusted mean 4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P=.01), but this effect waned by 12months (3,861 vs 3,383, P=.09). For participants with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group walked significantly more than controls at both 2months (P=.03) and 12months (P=.02), while those with inadequate health literacy failed to show significant differences between treatment groups at either time point. Intervention participants were highly satisfied with the program.
   ConclusionAn automated exercise promotion system deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among older adults over the short-term. Effective methods for long-term maintenance of behavior change are needed.

TI  - Persuasion, task interruption and health regimen adherence
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY
CP  - 2nd International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE 2007)
AB  - Cueing strategies, such as real-time reminders, are among the most effective methods of persuading individuals to perform healthy behaviors such as taking their medication and exercising. However, these reminders often represent a task interruption for users who are engaged in work activities. This paper presents the results of a study which explores strategies for interrupting users at work to perform a healthy behavior, in which the primary outcome of interest is long-term adherence to a desired health behavior change regimen. We find that the degree of perceived politeness of interruptions is positively correlated with predicted long-term adherence, but negatively correlated with short-term compliance. We also find that, among several interruption coordination strategies previously explored in the literature, empathic interruptions are superior overall in gaining both short-term compliance and long-term adherence.

TI  - A Model of Social Explanations for a Conversational Movie Recommendation System
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 7TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HUMAN-AGENT INTERACTION (HAI'19)
CP  - 7th International Conference on Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)
AB  - A critical aspect of any recommendation process is explaining the reasoning behind each recommendation. These explanations can not only improve users' experiences, but also change their perception of the recommendation quality. This work describes our human-centered design for our conversational movie recommendation agent, which explains its decisions as humans would. After exploring and analyzing a corpus of dyadic interactions, we developed a computational model of explanations. We then incorporated this model in the architecture of a conversational agent and evaluated the resulting system via a user experiment. Our results show that social explanations can improve the perceived quality of both the system and the interaction, regardless of the intrinsic quality of the recommendations.

TI  - DESCRIBING AND ANIMATING COMPLEX COMMUNICATIVE VERBAL AND NONVERBAL BEHAVIOR USING EVA-FRAMEWORK
T2  - APPLIED ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Multimodal interfaces incorporating embodied conversational agents enable the development of novel concepts with regard to interaction management tactics in responsive human-machine interfaces. Such interfaces provide several additional nonverbal communication channels, such as natural visualized speech, facial expression, and different body motions. In order to simulate reactive humanlike communicative behavior and attitude, the realization of motion relies on different behavioral analyses and realization tactics and approaches. This article proposes a novel environment for "online" visual modeling of humanlike communicative behavior, named EVA-framework. In this study we focus on visual speech and nonverbal behavior synthesis by using hierarchical XML-based behavioral events and expressively adjustable motion templates. The main goal of the presented abstract motion notation scheme, named EVA-Script, is to enable the synthesis of unique and responsive behavior.

TI  - Language Use in Conversational Agent-Based Health Communication: Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Given the growing significance of conversational agents (CAs), researchers have conducted a plethora of relevant studies on various technology- and usability-oriented issues. However, few investigations focus on language use in CA-based health communication to examine its influence on the user perception of CAs and their role in delivering health care services.
   Objective: This review aims to present the language use of CAs in health care to identify the achievements made and breakthroughs to be realized to inform researchers and more specifically CA designers.
   Methods: This review was conducted by following the protocols of the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 statement. We first designed the search strategy according to the research aim and then performed the keyword searches in PubMed and ProQuest databases for retrieving relevant publications (n=179). Subsequently, 3 researchers screened and reviewed the publications independently to select studies meeting the predefined selection criteria. Finally, we synthesized and analyzed the eligible articles (N=11) through thematic synthesis.
   Results: Among the 11 included publications, 6 deal exclusively with the language use of the CAs studied, and the remaining 5 are only partly related to this topic. The language use of the CAs in these studies can be roughly classified into six themes: (1) personal pronouns, (2) responses to health and lifestyle prompts, (3) strategic wording and rich linguistic resources, (4) a 3-staged conversation framework, (5) human-like well-manipulated conversations, and (6) symbols and images coupled with phrases. These derived themes effectively engaged users in health communication. Meanwhile, we identified substantial room for improvement based on the inconsistent responses of some CAs and their inability to present large volumes of information on safety-critical health and lifestyle prompts.
   Conclusions: This is the first systematic review of language use in CA-based health communication. The results and limitations identified in the 11 included papers can give fresh insights into the design and development, popularization, and research of CA applications. This review can provide practical implications for incorporating positive language use into the design of health CAs and improving their effective language output in health communication. In this way, upgraded CAs will be more capable of handling various health problems particularly in the context of nationwide and even worldwide public health crises.

TI  - Customizability in conversational agents and their impact on health engagement
T2  - HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) are effective tools for health behavior change, yet little research investigates the mechanisms through which they work. In accordance with the Computer as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, we suggest that agents are perceived as human-like actors and hence influence behavior much as human coaches might. As such, agents should be designed to resemble ideal interaction patterns-for example, by resembling their users. Our study will test this paradigm by testing the impact of customization on similarity and reciprocity, which in turn are hypothesized to improve perceptions of the agent and compliance with the agent's recommendations.

CP  - 10th Congress of the Italian-Association-for-Artificial-Intelligence
AB  - In this paper we investigate the interaction between emotional and non-emotional aspects of persuasion dialogues, from the viewpoint of both the system (the Persuader), when reasoning on the persuasion attempt, and the user (the Receiver), when reacting to it. We are working on an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) which applies natural argumentation techniques to persuade users to improve their behaviour in the healthy eating domain. The ECA observes the user's attitude during the dialogue, so as to select an appropriate persuasion strategy or to respond intelligently to user's reactions to suggestions received. We grounded our work on the analysis of two corpora: a corpus of 'natural' persuasion examples and a corpus of user's reactions to persuasion attempts.

TI  - The impact of chatbot conversational skill on engagement and perceived humanness
T2  - JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - Conversational agents (CAs)-frequently operationalized as chatbots-are computer systems that leverage natural language processing to engage in conversations with human users. CAs are often operationalized as chatbots which are used for many applications including technical support, customer service, and digital personal assistants. Despite their widespread use, little research to date has investigated how improving the conversational skill of a CA impacts user perceptions of the agent. To elucidate this relationship, this research uses Social Presence Theory to describe how conversational skill influences perceived social presence and ultimately anthropomorphism of a chatbot. We conducted a series of studies in which 450 participants interacted with CAs exhibiting varying levels of conversational skill. We show that people perceive a more skilled CA to be more socially present and anthropomorphic than a less skilled CA. This research advances the knowledge of computer-human interface in information systems, as CA research to date has largely focused on the technical challenges rather than the behavioral questions of how users interact with CAs.

TI  - Investigating the Potential of a Conversational Agent (Phyllis) to Support Adolescent Health and Overcome Barriers to Physical Activity: Co-Design Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are a promising solution to support people in improving physical activity (PA) behaviors. However, there is a lack of CAs targeted at adolescents that aim to provide support to overcome barriers to PA. This study reports the results of the co -design, development, and evaluation of a prototype CA called "Phyllis" to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA with the aim of improving PA behaviors. The study presents one of the first theory -driven CAs that use existing research, a theoretical framework, and a behavior change model. Objective: The aim of the study is to use a mixed methods approach to investigate the potential of a CA to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA and enhance their confidence and motivation to engage in PA. Methods: The methodology involved co -designing with 8 adolescents to create a relational and persuasive CA with a suitable persona and dialogue. The CA was evaluated to determine its acceptability, usability, and effectiveness, with 46 adolescents participating in the study via a web -based survey. Results: The co -design participants were students aged 11 to 13 years, with a sex distribution of 56% (5/9) female and 44% (4/9) male, representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. Participants reported 37 specific barriers to PA, and the most common barriers included a "lack of confidence," "fear of failure," and a "lack of motivation." The CA's persona, named "Phyllis," was co -designed with input from the students, reflecting their preferences for a friendly, understanding, and intelligent personality. Users engaged in 61 conversations with Phyllis and reported a positive user experience, and 73% of them expressed a definite intention to use the fully functional CA in the future, with a net promoter score indicating a high likelihood of recommendation. Phyllis also performed well, being able to recognize a range of different barriers to PA. The CA's persuasive capacity was evaluated in modules focusing on confidence and motivation, with a significant increase in students' agreement in feeling confident and motivated to engage in PA after interacting with Phyllis. Adolescents also expect to have a personalized experience and be able to personalize all aspects of the CA. Conclusions: The results showed high acceptability and a positive user experience, indicating the CA's potential. Promising outcomes were observed, with increasing confidence and motivation for PA. Further research and development are needed to create further interventions to address other barriers to PA and assess long-term behavior change. Addressing concerns regarding bias and privacy is crucial for achieving acceptability in the future. The CA's potential extends to health care systems and multimodal support, providing valuable insights for designing digital health interventions including tackling global inactivity issues among adolescents.

TI  - On-Demand Virtual Health Counselor for Delivering Behavior-Change Health Interventions
T2  - 2013 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS (ICHI 2013)
CP  - 1st IEEE International Conference on Healthcare Informatics (ICHI)
AB  - In this paper, we discuss a novel approach for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for health behavior change. We describe the basic elements of our system architecture, and focus on enabling a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to deliver the health behavior change interventions empathetically by adapting, in realtime, its verbal and non-verbal communication messages to those of its clients. The designed empathy model integrates a cognitive component and an affective components. We then discuss the evaluation experiment that we designed and conducted to evaluate the impact of empathy model on users' experience with the empathic character. Results indicate that, in comparison with the non-empathic counselor, the empathic one is better accepted (e.g., more enjoyable, empathizing, engaging, and likable) and some users might be willing to disclose more private information (e.g., drinking habits) to the counselor endowed with empathic abilities than the one without.

TI  - What to Discuss?-A Blueprint Topic Model for Health Coaching Dialogues With Conversational Agents
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) are often included as virtual coaches in eHealth applications. Tailoring conversations with these coaches to the individual user can increase the effectiveness of the coaching. An improvement for this tailoring process could be to (automatically) tailor the conversation at the topic level. In this article, we describe the design and evaluation of a blueprint topic model for use in the implementation of such topic selection. First, we constructed a topic model by extracting actions from the literature that a CA as coach could perform. We divided these actions in groups and labeled them with topics. We included literature from the behavioral psychology, relational agents and persuasive technology domains. Second, we evaluated this topic model through an online closed card sort study with health coaching experts. The constructed topic model contains 30 topics and 115 actions. Overall, the sorting of actions into topics was validated by the 11 experts participating in the card sort. Cards with actions that were sorted incorrectly mostly missed an immediacy indicator in their description (e.g., the difference between "you could plan regular walks" as opposed to "let's plan a walk") and/or were based on behavior change techniques that were difficult to translate to a conversation. The blueprint topic model presented in this article is an important step towards more intelligent virtual coaches. Future research should focus on the implementation of automatic topic selection. Furthermore, tailoring of coaching dialogues with CAs in multiple steps could be further investigated, for example, from the technical or user interaction perspective.

TI  - MCTK: a Multi-modal Conversational Troubleshooting Kit for supporting users in web applications
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORKING CONFERENCE ON ADVANCED VISUAL INTERFACES AVI 2022
CP  - 16th Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces (ACM AVI)
AB  - Conversational Interfaces for user assistance are becoming persuasive. Today, though, most chatbots are not integrated into the application in which they are placed, but only superimposed, with no communication between the conversational and the graphical interface. We propose Multi-modal Conversational Troubleshooting Kit (MCTK), a Python package to easily integrate a conversational agent for troubleshooting in web applications. MCTK is multi-modal: once the system recognizes the problem the user is encountering, the textual solution in the chat is coupled with visual hints in the GUI. On top of that, MCTK is easy to configure and offers separation of concerns: dialogue designers can work on the conversation without the necessity of modifying the code, and vice versa.

TI  - How should a virtual agent present psychoeducation? Influence of verbal and textual presentation on adherence
T2  - TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications, virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness, therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications, it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks, but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation, information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context, this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence.
   METHODS: This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy, namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample, to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study, we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing, we asked participants (n = 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation.
   RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover, after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection, presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent did.

TI  - Tailoring coaching strategies to users' motivation in a multi-agent health coaching application
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - Embodied conversational agents are often included in health behaviour change applications as intelligent virtual coaches. A major challenge in their development is tailoring coaching dialogues to user profiles. Agents should collect information about the user and consequently adapt the strategy that guides their interactions. Previous research discovered relations between users' motivation profiles and potential effective coaching strategies. In the current paper, we describe an experiment with multiple agents that tests if users with certain motivation profiles prefer certain (tailored) strategies. Participants were classified into four motivation groups (Intrinsic Motivation, External Regulation, Dual Motivation, A-motivation), following their responses to a questionnaire on motivation towards healthy living. Then, two coaches suggested a positively and a negatively tailored strategy. Participants rated these and chose their favourite. Results (N = 108) show that the Dual Motivation group appreciated their positively tailored strategy more than their negatively tailored strategy, while intrinsically motivated participants appreciated both strategies. Furthermore, agents' likeability does not seem to influence strategy appreciation, while there was an effect of participant's age and gender. We conclude that coaching strategies for dialogues with agents can be tailored to personal motivation to live healthy. Future research should focus on performing a long-term study in a real-life setting.

TI  - Towards a Dialectical Approach for Conversational Agents in Selling Situations
T2  - ARGUMENTATION IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS (ARGMAS)
CP  - 7th International Workshop on Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems (ArgMAS)
AB  - The use of virtual agents to intelligently interface with online customers of e-commerce businesses is remarkably increasing. Most of these virtual agents are designed to assist online customers while searching for information related to a specific product or service, while few agents are intended for promoting and selling a product or a service. Within the later type, our aim is to provide proactive agents that recommend a specific item and justify this recommendation to a customer based on his purchases history and his needs. In this paper, we propose a dialectical argumentation approach that would allow virtual agents that have sales goals to trigger persuasions with e-commerce's customers. Then, we illustrate the proposed idea through its integration with an example from real-life.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of Learner Control and Interactivity in Conversational Tutoring Systems for Persuasive Writing
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN EDUCATION
AB  - Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer a promising avenue for individualized learning support, especially in domains like persuasive writing. Although these systems have the potential to enhance the learning process, the specific role of learner control and inter- activity within them remains underexplored. This paper introduces WritingTutor, a CTS designed to guide students through the pro- cess of crafting persuasive essays, with a focus on varying levels of learner control. In an experimental study involving 96 students, we evaluated the effects of high-level learner control, encompassing con- tent navigation and interface appearance control, against a benchmark version of WritingTutor without these features and a static, non- interactive tutoring group. Preliminary findings suggest that tutoring and learner control might enhance the learning experience in terms of enjoyment, ease-of-use, and perceived autonomy. However, these differences are not significant after pair-wise comparison and appear not to translate to significant differences in learning outcomes. This research contributes to the understanding of learner control in CTS, offering empirical insights into its influence on the learning experience.

T2  - 2019 IEEE 31ST INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI 2019)
CP  - 31st IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)
AB  - Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are versatile tools that have the potential of being used in dialogical argumentation. They could possibly be deployed in tasks such as persuasion for behaviour change (e.g. persuading people to eat more fruit, to take regular exercise, etc.). However, to achieve this, there is a need to develop methods for acquiring appropriate arguments and counterargument that reflect both sides of the discussion. For instance, to persuade someone to do regular exercise, the chatbot needs to know counterarguments that the user might have for not doing exercise. To address this need, we present methods for acquiring arguments and counterarguments, and importantly, meta-level information that can be useful for deciding when arguments can be used during an argumentation dialogue. We evaluate these methods in studies with participants and show how harnessing these methods in a chatbot can make it more persuasive.

TI  - Werewolf Among Us: Multimodal Resources for Modeling Persuasion Behaviors in Social Deduction Games
T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, ACL 2023
CP  - 61st Annual Meeting of the the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)
AB  - Persuasion modeling is a key building block for conversational agents. Existing works in this direction are limited to analyzing textual dialogue corpora. We argue that visual signals also play an important role in understanding human persuasive behaviors. In this paper, we introduce the first multimodal dataset for modeling persuasion behaviors. Our dataset includes 199 dialogue transcriptions and videos captured in a multi-player social deduction game setting, 26, 647 utterance level annotations of persuasion strategy, and game level annotations of deduction game outcomes. We provide extensive experiments to show how dialogue context and visual signals benefit persuasion strategy prediction. We also explore the generalization ability of language models for persuasion modeling and the role of persuasion strategies in predicting social deduction game outcomes. Our dataset can be found at https://persuasion- deductiongame. socialai-data.org. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/ SALT-NLP/PersuationGames.

TI  - Peer Buddy or Expert? - On the Avatar Design of a Virtual Coach for Obesity Patients
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 55TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
CP  - 55th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
AB  - Morbid obesity in association with comorbidities is a considerable burden for the healthcare systems worldwide. Long-term weight loss maintenance requires sustainable behavioral changes but poor adherence is a significant problem in obesity care today and patients often relapse. Prior research has found conversational agents with of a humanoid representation (avatar) embodying the role of a virtual coach useful for the interface of health behavior change support systems. Regarding the avatar design, the coach could, e.g., take the role of an obese "peer buddy" or a lean "expert". Based on requirements and design principles derived from the literature, the present study investigates how the avatar should be designed. Therefore, two patient surveys were conducted to evaluate static and dynamic representations of potential coaches. The results suggest that patients welcome the concept and lean "expert" coaches might be more suitable in an obesity context. Design implications for future research are derived and discussed.

AB  - In this paper, we investigate the user's reactions to received suggestion by an Embodied Conversational Agent playing the role of artificial therapist in the healthy eating domain. Specifically, we analyse the behaviour of people who voluntarily requested to receive information from the agent, and we compare it with the results of a previous evaluation experiment in which subjects were not properly motivated to interact with the agent because they were selected for evaluating the system. This study is part of an ongoing research aimed at developing an intelligent virtual agent that applies natural argumentation techniques to persuade the users to improve their eating habits.

TI  - Customizability in Conversational Agents and Their Impact on Health Engagement (Stage 2)
T2  - HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) are effective tools for health behavior change, yet little research investigates the mechanisms through which they work. Following the Computer as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, we suggest that agents are perceived as human-like actors and hence influence behavior much as human coaches might. As such, agents should be designed to resemble ideal interaction patterns, for example, by resembling their users. In this registered report, we evaluated this paradigm by testing the impact of customization on similarity and reciprocity, which in turn were hypothesized to improve perceptions of the agent and compliance with the agent's recommendations to complete a cognitive training exercise. In an online study, 2437 participants were randomly assigned to one of two surface-level CA customization conditions (present/absent) and to one of two deep-level CA customization conditions (present/absent) in a between-subject experimental design. As part of a conversation flow with a CA, participants assigned to the present surface- and/or deep-level customization conditions were able to choose their preferred CA based on the four personality summaries and/or choose their CA's gender (male/female/agender robotic), avatar (choice between seven avatars corresponding to the chosen gender), and name. While the ability to customize increased similarity to the user and the perceptions of customizability, our findings show that customization did not impact experience or compliance. However, the perceived customizability of the agent was linked to increases in the likeability and usefulness of the agent. We conclude that our work finds no negative effects of customization; yet, its impact on the relationship between the agent and its user is complex and can benefit from more research as merited by its applicability to public health. As aging and ill populations increase the burden on health systems worldwide, CAs have the potential to transform the landscape of accessible care.

TI  - Development of a Conversational Agent for Individuals Ambivalent About Quitting Smoking: Protocol for a Proof-of-Concept Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. Despite the availability of a plethora of evidence-based smoking cessation resources, less than one-third of individuals who smoke seek cessation services, and individuals using these services are often those who are actively contemplating quitting smoking. There is a distinct dearth of low-cost, scalable interventions to support smokers not ready to quit (ambivalent smokers). Such interventions can assist in gradually promoting smoking behavior changes in this target population until motivation to quit arises, at which time they can be navigated to existing evidence-based smoking cessation interventions. Conversational agents or chatbots could provide cessation education and support to ambivalent smokers to build motivation and navigate them to evidence-based resources when ready to quit. Objective: The goal of our study is to test the proof-of-concept of the development and preliminary feasibility and acceptability of a smoking cessation support chatbot. Methods: We will accomplish our study aims in 2 phases. In phase 1, we will survey 300 ambivalent smokers to determine their preferences and priorities for a smoking cessation support chatbot. A "forced-choice experiment" will be administered to understand participants' preferred characteristics (attributes) of the proposed chatbot prototype. The data gathered will be used to program the prototype. In phase 2, we will invite 25 individuals who smoke to use the developed prototype. For this phase, participants will receive an overview of the chatbot and be encouraged to use the chatbot and engage and interact with the programmed attributes and components for a 2-week period. Results: At the end of phase 1, we anticipate identifying key attributes that ambivalent smokers prefer in a smoking cessation support chatbot. At the end of phase 2, chatbot acceptability and feasibility will be assessed. The study was funded in June 2022, and data collection for both phases of the study is currently ongoing. We expect study results to be published by December 2023. Conclusions: Study results will yield a smoking behavior change chatbot prototype developed for ambivalent smokers that will be ready for efficacy testing in a larger study.

TI  - Establishing the computer-patient working alliance in automated health behavior change interventions
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
AB  - Current user interfaces for automated patient and consumer health care,systems can be improved by leveraging the results of several decades of research into effective patient-provider communication skills. A research project is presented in which several such "relational" skills - including empathy, social dialogue, nonverbal immediacy behaviors, and other behaviors to build and maintain good working relationships over multiple interactions - are explicitly designed into a computer interface within the context of a longitudinal health behavior change intervention for physical activity adoption. Results of a comparison among 33 subjects interacting near-daily with the relational system and 27 interacting near-daily with an identical system with the relational behaviors ablated, each for 30 days indicate, that the use of relational behaviors by the system significantly increases working alliance and desire to continue working with the system. Comparison of the above groups to another group of 31 subjects interacting with a control system near-daily for 30 days also indicated a significant increase in proactive viewing of health information.

TI  - Digital Behavior Change Interventions for the Prevention and Management of Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Market Analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Advancements in technology offer new opportunities for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Venture capital companies have been investing in digital diabetes companies that offer digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). However, little is known about the scientific evidence underpinning such interventions or the degree to which these interventions leverage novel technology-driven automated developments such as conversational agents (CAs) or just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) approaches.
   Objective: Our objectives were to identify the top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes management and prevention, review the level of scientific evidence underpinning the DBCIs, identify which DBCIs are recognized as evidence-based programs by quality assurance authorities, and examine the degree to which these DBCIs include novel automated approaches such as CAs and JITAI mechanisms.
   Methods: A systematic search was conducted using 2 venture capital databases (Crunchbase Pro and Pitchbook) to identify the top-funded companies offering interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention and management. Scientific publications relating to the identified DBCIs were identified via PubMed, Google Scholar, and the DBCIs' websites, and data regarding intervention effectiveness were extracted. The Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was used to identify the recognition status. The DBCIs' publications, websites, and mobile apps were reviewed with regard to the intervention characteristics.
   Results: The 16 top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes received a total funding of US $2.4 billion as of June 15, 2021. Only 4 out of the 50 identified publications associated with these DBCIs were fully powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Further, 1 of those 4 RCTs showed a significant difference in glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)) outcomes between the intervention and control groups. However, all the studies reported HbA(1c) improvements ranging from 0.2% to 1.9% over the course of 12 months. In addition, 6 interventions were fully recognized by the DPRP to deliver evidence-based programs, and 2 interventions had a pending recognition status. Health professionals were included in the majority of DBCIs (13/16, 81%,), whereas only 10% (1/10) of accessible apps involved a CA as part of the intervention delivery. Self-reports represented most of the data sources (74/119, 62%) that could be used to tailor JITAIs.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the level of funding received by companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes prevention and management does not coincide with the level of evidence on the intervention effectiveness. There is considerable variation in the level of evidence underpinning the different DBCIs and an overall need for more rigorous effectiveness trials and transparent reporting by quality assurance authorities. Currently, very few DBCIs use automated approaches such as CAs and JITAIs, limiting the scalability and reach of these solutions.

TI  - Planning Habit: Daily Planning Prompts with Alexa
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2021)
CP  - 16th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (Persuasive)
AB  - The widespread adoption of intelligent voice assistants (IVAs), like Amazon's Alexa or Google's Assistant, presents new opportunities for designers of persuasive technologies to explore how to support people's behavior change goals and habits with voice technology. In this work, we explore how to use planning prompts, a technique from behavior science to make specific and effective plans, with IVAs. We design and conduct usability testing (N = 13) on a voice app called Planning Habit that encourages users to formulate daily plans out loud. We identify strategies that make it possible to successfully adapt planning prompts to voice format. We then conduct a week-long online deployment (N = 40) of the voice app in the context of daily productivity. Overall, we find that traditional forms of planning prompts can be adapted to and enhanced by IVA technology.

TI  - A Digital Coach to Promote Emotion Regulation Skills
T2  - MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERACTION
AB  - There is growing awareness that effective emotion regulation is critical for health, adjustment and wellbeing. Emerging evidence suggests that interventions that promote flexible emotion regulation may have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in specific at-risk populations. The challenge is how best to engage with at risk populations, who may not be actively seeking assistance, to deliver this early intervention approach. One possible solution is via digital technology and development, which has rapidly accelerated in this space. Such rapid growth has, however, occurred at the expense of developing a deep understanding of key elements of successful program design and specific mechanisms that influence health behavior change. This paper presents a detailed description of the design, development and evaluation of an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) who acts as a digital coach. ERICA uses interactive conversation to encourage self-reflection and to support and empower users to learn a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies including Refocusing, Reappraisal, Planning and Putting into Perspective. A pilot evaluation of ERICA was conducted with 138 university students and confirmed that ERICA provided a feasible and highly usable method for delivering an emotion regulation intervention. The results also indicated that ERICA was able to develop a therapeutic relationship with participants and increase their intent to use a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies. These findings suggest that ERICA holds potential to be an effective approach for delivering an early intervention to support mental health and wellbeing. ERICA's dialogue, embedded with interactivity, therapeutic alliance and empathy cues, provide the basis for the development of other psychoeducation interventions.

TI  - Effects of Persuasive Dialogues: Testing Bot Identities and Inquiry Strategies
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2020 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI'20)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
AB  - Intelligent conversational agents, or chatbots, can take on various identities and are increasingly engaging in more humancentered conversations with persuasive goals. However, little is known about how identities and inquiry strategies influence the conversation's effectiveness. We conducted an online study involving 790 participants to be persuaded by a chatbot for charity donation. We designed a two by four factorial experiment (two chatbot identities and four inquiry strategies) where participants were randomly assigned to different conditions. Findings showed that the perceived identity of the chatbot had significant effects on the persuasion outcome (i.e., donation) and interpersonal perceptions (i.e., competence, confidence, warmth, and sincerity). Further, we identified interaction effects among perceived identities and inquiry strategies. We discuss the findings for theoretical and practical implications for developing ethical and effective persuasive chatbots. Our published data, codes, and analyses serve as the first step towards building competent ethical persuasive chatbots.

TI  - Scope, Characteristics, Behavior Change Techniques, and Quality of Conversational Agents for Mental Health and Well-Being: Systematic Assessment of Apps
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Mental disorders cause substantial health-related burden worldwide. Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated costs. Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being. There is a need to discern the active components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately improve users' mental health.
   Objective: This study systematically identified mental health conversational agents (CAs) currently available in app stores and assessed the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used. We further described their main features, technical aspects, and quality in terms of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information using the Mobile Application Rating Scale.
   Methods: The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and an evaluation following predefined criteria. We conducted a systematic app search of Apple's App Store and Google Play using 42matters. Apps with CAs in English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. The BCT taxonomy v1, a comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change components in CAs.
   Results: We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. Most CAs had <1000 user ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). All CAs addressed >1 mental disorder. Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Half (9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). CAs used 48 different BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. The most common BCTs were 3.3 "Social support (emotional)," 4.1 "Instructions for how to perform a behavior," 11.2 "Reduce negative emotions," and 6.1 "Demonstration of the behavior." One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not include core CBT concepts.
   Conclusions: Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. The most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental disorders with few therapeutic elements. CA developers should consider the quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management when designing mental health CAs. Future research should assess the role of artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital mental health interventions.

TI  - Motivating Health Behavior Change with Humorous Virtual Agents
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS (ACM IVA 2020)
CP  - 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (ACM IVA)
AB  - Research on the psychology of humor indicates that humor can increase the impact of persuasive messages in certain circumstances, suggesting that virtual agents could use humor to improve the effectiveness of motivational counseling with users. To explore this idea, we developed two virtual agents that attempt to motivate users to perform healthy behaviors - either to increase exercise or fruit and vegetable consumption - and systematically vary whether they use humor or not in their counseling conversations. Humana-uthored jokes were selected from a large corpus based on the nature of the humor (empathetic affiliative humor that serves to build relational closeness), health topic relevance, and subjective ratings of funniness, as well as relevance to user stage of behavior change. We evaluated our agents in a two-treatment counter-balanced within-subjects experiment, where participants interacted with a humorous and non-humorous agent motivating either exercise or healthy diet. We found the interaction with the humorous agent led to a significantly greater change in motivation to engage in the target behavior than interacting with the non-humorous agent.

TI  - Participatory Development and Pilot Testing of an Adolescent Health Promotion Chatbot
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: The use of chatbots may increase engagement with digital behavior change interventions in youth by providing human-like interaction. Following a Person-Based Approach (PBA), integrating user preferences in digital tool development is crucial for engagement, whereas information on youth preferences for health chatbots is currently limited.Objective: The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of adolescents' expectations and preferences for health chatbots and describe the systematic development of a health promotion chatbot.Methods: Three studies in three different stages of PBA were conducted: (1) a qualitative focus group study (n = 36), (2) log data analysis during pretesting (n = 6), and (3) a mixed-method pilot testing (n = 73).Results: Confidentiality, connection to youth culture, and preferences when referring to other sources were important aspects for youth in chatbots. Youth also wanted a chatbot to provide small talk and broader support (e.g., technical support with the tool) rather than specifically in relation to health behaviors. Despite the meticulous approach of PBA, user engagement with the developed chatbot was modest.Conclusion: This study highlights that conducting formative research at different stages is an added value and that adolescents have different chatbot preferences than adults. Further improvement to build an engaging chatbot for youth may stem from using living databases.

TI  - Can digital personal assistants persuade people to exercise?
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Digital personal assistants (DPAs) have recently grown in popularity because they are both a commercially available new technology and reasonably affordable to the average household. This opens opportunities for new ways to assist people in everyday activities in their homes through voice-interaction. Physical activity has significant health benefits, and yet globally, 1 in 4 adults are not active enough. To address this, we investigate the persuasive potential of DPAs in increasing people's physical activity at home. We conducted a study with 48 participants to understand the effect of applying three of Fogg's persuasive principles to the design of a DPA exercise programme: Suggestion, Virtual Reward, and Praise. Our findings show that DPAs have the potential, within their current technical and reactive capabilities, to persuade people to increase their physical activity at home, using Suggestion to encourage physical effort, Virtual Reward to encourage endurance, and Praise to create reassurance for beginners. Based on this, we offer three alternate perspectives for developing persuasive DPAs. We also discuss limitations of the study and suggest future research directions around using persuasion with DPAs.

TI  - Changing Parent Attitudes Towards HPV Vaccination by Including Adolescents in Multiparty Counseling using Virtual Agents
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2023
CP  - 23rd ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)
AB  - Parental permission is required for medical care for children, and decisions may be made without incorporating children's views, even for adolescents. We explore the impact of including adolescents in virtual agent-based multiparty health counseling to promote Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The agent is designed to encourage HPV vaccination for children aged 9-12 by engaging co-present parent/adolescent dyads in an online interaction. Several techniques are incorporated, including HPV education, motivational interviewing, persuasion, modeling, and enablement, to address parents' intent to vaccinate their children. We conduct a between-subjects randomized study comparing a version of the agent exclusively for the parent, to one that includes the adolescent in the conversation and incorporates the child's views in counseling strategies. We measure pre- and post-intervention changes in intent to vaccinate, vaccination hesitancy, and knowledge in both the parent and the adolescent, hypothesizing greater improvements in these measures when the adolescent is included in the conversation. We also examine the satisfaction, engagement, and comfort of the parent/child interactions with the virtual agent. We found significant pre-post increases in parent intent to vaccinate their adolescent for both versions of the agent. Our work provides insights into the effectiveness of the virtual agent in promoting HPV vaccination, the impact of child participation on healthcare decision-making, and the user experience of multi-party interaction with the virtual agent.

TI  - Artificially intelligent chatbots in digital mental health interventions: a review
T2  - EXPERT REVIEW OF MEDICAL DEVICES
AB  - Introduction Increasing demand for mental health services and the expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has driven the development of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). To date, AI-based chatbots have been integrated into DMHIs to support diagnostics and screening, symptom management and behavior change, and content delivery. Areas covered We summarize the current landscape of DMHIs, with a focus on AI-based chatbots. Happify Health's AI chatbot, Anna, serves as a case study for discussion of potential challenges and how these might be addressed, and demonstrates the promise of chatbots as effective, usable, and adoptable within DMHIs. Finally, we discuss ways in which future research can advance the field, addressing topics including perceptions of AI, the impact of individual differences, and implications for privacy and ethics. Expert opinion Our discussion concludes with a speculative viewpoint on the future of AI in DMHIs, including the use of chatbots, the evolution of AI, dynamic mental health systems, hyper-personalization, and human-like intervention delivery.

TI  - Evaluation of the Current State of Chatbots for Digital Health: Scoping Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Chatbots have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, enabling natural language conversations with users through various modes of communication. Chatbots have the potential to play a significant role in promoting health and well-being. As the number of studies and available products related to chatbots continues to rise, there is a critical need to assess product features to enhance the design of chatbots that effectively promote health and behavioral change. Objective: This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state of health-related chatbots, including the chatbots' characteristics and features, user backgrounds, communication models, relational building capacity, personalization, interaction, responses to suicidal thoughts, and users' in-app experiences during chatbot use. Through this analysis, we seek to identify gaps in the current research, guide future directions, and enhance the design of health-focused chatbots. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology by Arksey and O'Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist, this study used a two-pronged approach to identify relevant chatbots: (1) searching the iOS and Android App Stores and (2) reviewing scientific literature through a search strategy designed by a librarian. Overall, 36 chatbots were selected based on predefined criteria from both sources. These chatbots were systematically evaluated using a comprehensive framework developed for this study, including chatbot characteristics, user backgrounds, building relational capacity, personalization, interaction models, responses to critical situations, and user experiences. Ten coauthors were responsible for downloading and testing the chatbots, coding their features, and evaluating their performance in simulated conversations. The testing of all chatbot apps was limited to their free-to-use features. Results: This review provides an overview of the diversity of health-related chatbots, encompassing categories such as mental health support, physical activity promotion, and behavior change interventions. Chatbots use text, animations, speech, images, and emojis for communication. The findings highlight variations in conversational capabilities, including empathy, humor, and personalization. Notably, concerns regarding safety, particularly in addressing suicidal thoughts, were evident. Approximately 44% (16/36) of the chatbots effectively addressed suicidal thoughts. User experiences and behavioral outcomes demonstrated the potential of chatbots in health interventions, but evidence remains limited. Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significance of chatbots in health-related applications and offers insights into their features, functionalities, and user experiences. This study contributes to advancing the understanding of chatbots' role in digital health interventions, thus paving the way for more effective and user-centric health promotion strategies. This study informs future research directions, emphasizing the need for rigorous randomized control trials, standardized evaluation metrics, and user-centered design to unlock the full potential of chatbots in enhancing health and well-being. Future research should focus on addressing limitations, exploring real-world user experiences, and implementing robust data security and privacy measures.

TI  - Personalization of Conversational Agent-Patient Interaction Styles for Chronic Disease Management: Two Consecutive Cross-sectional Questionnaire Studies
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs) for chronic disease management are receiving increasing attention in academia and the industry. However, long-term adherence to CAs is still a challenge and needs to be explored. Personalization of CAs has the potential to improve long-term adherence and, with it, user satisfaction, task efficiency, perceived benefits, and intended behavior change. Research on personalized CAs has already addressed different aspects, such as personalized recommendations and anthropomorphic cues. However, detailed information on interaction styles between patients and CAs in the role of medical health care professionals is scant. Such interaction styles play essential roles for patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and outcome, as has been shown for physician-patient interactions. Currently, it is not clear (1) whether chronically ill patients prefer a CA with a paternalistic, informative, interpretive, or deliberative interaction style, and (2) which factors influence these preferences.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the preferences of chronically ill patients for CA-delivered interaction styles.
   Methods: We conducted two studies. The first study included a paper-based approach and explored the preferences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for paternalistic, informative, interpretive, and deliberative CA-delivered interaction styles. Based on these results, a second study assessed the effects of the paternalistic and deliberative interaction styles on the relationship quality between the CA and patients via hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses in an online experiment with COPD patients. Patients' sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics served as moderator variables.
   Results: Study 1 with 117 COPD patients revealed a preference for the deliberative (50/117) and informative (34/117) interaction styles across demographic characteristics. All patients who preferred the paternalistic style over the other interaction styles had more severe COPD (three patients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease class 3 or 4). In Study 2 with 123 newly recruited COPD patients, younger participants and participants with a less recent COPD diagnosis scored higher on interaction-related outcomes when interacting with a CA that delivered the deliberative interaction style (interaction between age and CA type: relationship quality: b=-0.77, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.18; intention to continue interaction: b=-0.49, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.01; working alliance attachment bond: b=-0.65, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.04; working alliance goal agreement: b=-0.59, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.01; interaction between recency of COPD diagnosis and CA type: working alliance goal agreement: b=0.57, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.13).
   Conclusions: Our results indicate that age and a patient's personal disease experience inform which CA interaction style the patient should be paired with to achieve increased interaction-related outcomes with the CA. These results allow the design of personalized health care CAs with the goal to increase long-term adherence to health-promoting behavior.

TI  - Exploring Users' Experiences With a Quick-Response Chatbot Within a Popular Smoking Cessation Smartphone App: Semistructured Interview Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Engagement with smartphone apps for smoking cessation tends to be low. Chatbots (ie, software that enables conversations with users) offer a promising means of increasing engagement.
   Objective: We aimed to explore smokers' experiences with a quick-response chatbot (Quit Coach) implemented within a popular smoking cessation app and identify factors that influence users' engagement with Quit Coach.
   Methods: In-depth, one-to-one, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted with adult, past-year smokers who had voluntarily used Quit Coach in a recent smoking cessation attempt (5/14, 36%) and current smokers who agreed to download and use Quit Coach for a minimum of 2 weeks to support a new cessation attempt (9/14, 64%). Verbal reports were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed within a constructivist theoretical framework using inductive thematic analysis.
   Results: A total of 3 high-order themes were generated to capture users' experiences and engagement with Quit Coach: anthropomorphism of and accountability to Quit Coach (ie, users ascribing human-like characteristics and thoughts to the chatbot, which helped foster a sense of accountability to it), Quit Coach's interaction style and format (eg, positive and motivational tone of voice and quick and easy-to-complete check-ins), and users' perceived need for support (ie, chatbot engagement was motivated by seeking distraction from cravings or support to maintain motivation to stay quit).
   Conclusions: Anthropomorphism of a quick-response chatbot implemented within a popular smoking cessation app appeared to be enabled by its interaction style and format and users' perceived need for support, which may have given rise to feelings of accountability and increased engagement.

TI  - Can digital health researchers make a difference during the pandemic? Results of the single-arm, chatbot-led Elena plus : Care for COVID-19 interventional study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background The current paper details findings from Elena+: Care for COVID-19, an app developed to tackle the collateral damage of lockdowns and social distancing, by offering pandemic lifestyle coaching across seven health areas: anxiety, loneliness, mental resources, sleep, diet and nutrition, physical activity, and COVID-19 information.Methods The Elena+ app functions as a single-arm interventional study, with participants recruited predominantly via social media. We used paired samples T-tests and within subjects ANOVA to examine changes in health outcome assessments and user experience evaluations over time. To investigate the mediating role of behavioral activation (i.e., users setting behavioral intentions and reporting actual behaviors) we use mixed-effect regression models. Free-text entries were analyzed qualitatively.Results Results show strong demand for publicly available lifestyle coaching during the pandemic, with total downloads (N = 7 & PRIME;135) and 55.8% of downloaders opening the app (n = 3,928) with 9.8% completing at least one subtopic (n = 698). Greatest areas of health vulnerability as assessed with screening measures were physical activity with 62% (n = 1,000) and anxiety with 46.5% (n = 760). The app was effective in the treatment of mental health; with a significant decrease in depression between first (14 days), second (28 days), and third (42 days) assessments: F-2,F-38 = 7.01, p = 0.003, with a large effect size (?2G = 0.14), and anxiety between first and second assessments: t(54) = 3.7, p = <0.001 with a medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.499). Those that followed the coaching program increased in net promoter score between the first and second assessment: t(36) = 2.08, p = 0.045 with a small to medium effect size (Cohen d = 0.342). Mediation analyses showed that while increasing number of subtopics completed increased behavioral activation (i.e., match between behavioral intentions and self-reported actual behaviors), behavioral activation did not mediate the relationship to improvements in health outcome assessments.Conclusions Findings show that: (i) there is public demand for chatbot led digital coaching, (ii) such tools can be effective in delivering treatment success, and (iii) they are highly valued by their long-term user base. As the current intervention was developed at rapid speed to meet the emergency pandemic context, the future looks bright for other public health focused chatbot-led digital health interventions.

TI  - Path Modeling of Visual Attention, User Perceptions, and Behavior Change Intentions in Conversations With Embodied Agents in VR
T2  - COMPUTER ANIMATION AND VIRTUAL WORLDS
AB  - This study examines how subtitles and image visualizations influence gaze behavior, working alliance, and behavior change intentions in virtual health conversations with ECAs. Visualizations refer to images on a 3D model TV and text on a virtual whiteboard, both reinforcing key content conveyed by the ECA. Using a 2 x$$ \times $$ 2 factorial design, participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: no subtitles or visualizations (Control), subtitles only (SUB), visualizations only (VIS), or both subtitles and visualizations (VISSUB). Structural equation path modeling showed that SUB and VIS individually reduced gaze toward the ECA, whereas VISSUB moderated this reduction, resulting in less gaze loss than the sum of either condition alone. Gaze behavior was positively associated with working alliance, and perceptions of enjoyment and appropriateness influenced engagement, which in turn predicted behavior change intentions. VIS was negatively associated with behavior change intentions, suggesting that excessive visual input may introduce cognitive trade-offs.

TI  - Motivating Health Behavior Change with a Storytelling Virtual Agent
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 22ND ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2022
CP  - 22nd ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (IVA)
AB  - We developed a virtual agent that motivates church-going users to change their health behavior by telling existing cultural narratives that have high relevance with the counseling topic in an engaging way. We evaluated this agent in a between-subjects experiment where participants interacted with an agent that counseled them on nutrition either without a story, with a story but told in a neutral speech style, or with a story using dramatic delivery inspired by church sermons. We found that interaction with either one of the storytelling agents leads to a significantly greater change in confidence to engage in the target behavior of healthy eating than interacting with a non-storytelling agent, demonstrating the efficacy of stories in health counseling by virtual agents.

TI  - Attitudes Toward a Virtual Smoking Cessation Coach: Relationship and Willingness to Continue
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2023
CP  - 18th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - Virtual coaches have the potential to address the low adherence common to eHealth applications for behavior change by, for example, providing motivational support. However, given the multitude of factors affecting users' attitudes toward virtual coaches, more insights are needed on how such virtual coaches can be designed to affect these attitudes in a specific use context positively. Especially valuable are insights that are based on users interacting with such a virtual coach for longer. We thus conducted a study in which more than 500 smokers interacted with the text-based virtual coach Sam in five sessions. In each session, Sam assigned smokers a new preparatory activity for quitting smoking and provided motivational support for doing the activity. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of users' willingness to continue working and their relationship with Sam, we obtained eight themes for users' attitudes toward Sam. These themes relate to whether Sam is seen as human or artificial, specific characteristics of Sam (e.g., caring character), the interaction with Sam, and the relationship with Sam. We used these themes to formulate literature-based recommendations to guide designers of virtual coaches for behavior change. For example, letting the virtual coach get to know users and disclose more information about itself may improve its relationship with users.

T2  - 57TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2019)
CP  - 57th Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL)
AB  - Developing intelligent persuasive conversational agents to change people's opinions and actions for social good is the frontier in advancing the ethical development of automated dialogue systems. To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system.(1)

TI  - Effectiveness of Web-Based Interventions on Clinical Outcomes and Lifestyle Modifications in Women Planning to Conceive: A Systematic Review
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Purpose: to identify evidence on the effectiveness of web-based interventions for lifestyle modification among women or couples of reproductive ages wishing to conceive. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in February 2023 across CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Emcare, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Data from four randomized controlled trials involving 1965 preconception women were narratively synthesized following risk of bias assessment. Interventions included a web-based conversational agent system, an email-based mobile service, and a mobile app providing lifestyle-related information. Results: Despite diverse assessment tools, benefits were observed for systolic blood pressure, serum folate levels, and physical activity. However, no significant effects were found for intake of vegetables and fruit, folic acid supplementation, smoking, alcohol consumption, waist circumference, weight, BMI, overweight status, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL, stress, depression, anxiety, or pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions: Web-based interventions show potential in improving certain health behaviors among preconception women. Further high-quality studies are needed to assess their effectiveness on a broader range of outcomes, including dietary habits, physical activity, and substance use, and to inform their integration into preconception care strategies. Registration: We registered the study protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42023488277).

TI  - Engagement With a Relaxation and Mindfulness Mobile App Among People With Cancer: Exploratory Analysis of Use Data and Self-Reports From a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR CANCER
AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer unique opportunities to support self -care and behavior change, but poor user engagement limits their effectiveness. This is particularly true for fully automated mHealth apps without any human support. Human support in mHealth apps is associated with better engagement but at the cost of reduced scalability. Objective: This work aimed to (1) describe the theory -informed development of a fully automated relaxation and mindfulness app to reduce distress in people with cancer (CanRelax app 2.0), (2) describe engagement with the app on multiple levels within a fully automated randomized controlled trial over 10 weeks, and (3) examine whether engagement was related to user characteristics. Methods: The CanRelax app 2.0 was developed in iterative processes involving input from people with cancer and relevant experts. The app includes evidence -based relaxation exercises, personalized weekly coaching sessions with a rule -based conversational agent, 39 self-enactable behavior change techniques, a self -monitoring dashboard with gamification elements, highly tailored reminder notifications, an educational video clip, and personalized in -app letters. For the larger study, German-speaking adults diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years were recruited via the web in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. Engagement was analyzed in a sample of 100 study participants with multiple measures on a micro level (completed coaching sessions, relaxation exercises practiced with the app, and feedback on the app) and a macro level (relaxation exercises practiced without the app and self -efficacy toward self -set weekly relaxation goals). Results: In week 10, a total of 62% (62/100) of the participants were actively using the CanRelax app 2.0. No associations were identified between engagement and level of distress at baseline, sex assigned at birth, educational attainment, or age. At the micro level, 71.88% (3520/4897) of all relaxation exercises and 714 coaching sessions were completed in the app, and all participants who provided feedback (52/100, 52%) expressed positive app experiences. At the macro level, 28.12% (1377/4897) of relaxation exercises were completed without the app, and participants' self -efficacy remained stable at a high level. At the same time, participants raised their weekly relaxation goals, which indicates a potential relative increase in self -efficacy. Conclusions: The CanRelax app 2.0 achieved promising engagement even though it provided no human support. Fully automated social components might have compensated for the lack of human involvement and should be investigated further. More than one -quarter (1377/4897, 28.12%) of all relaxation exercises were practiced without the app, highlighting the importance of assessing engagement on multiple levels.

TI  - EREBOTS: Privacy-Compliant Agent-Based Platform for Multi-Scenario Personalized Health-Assistant Chatbots
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - Context. Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support human-machine interactions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained into humans' habits due to factors including (i) the availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based mechanisms to power the bots' behaviors. Nevertheless, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work addresses the challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii) enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive physical conditioning, smoking cessation, and support for breast-cancer survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals characterized by diverse age, gender, and country distribution have actively participated in the experimentation, reporting advancements in the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and exercises' variety they have been proposed.

TI  - Evaluating a realistic agent in an advice-giving task
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER STUDIES
AB  - The aim of this study was to empirically evaluate an embodied conversational agent called GRETA in an effort to answer two main questions: (1) What are the benefits (and costs) of presenting information via an animated agent, with certain characteristics, in a 'persuasion' task, compared to other forms of display? (2) How important is it that emotional expressions are added in a way that is consistent with the content of the message, in animated agents? To address these questions, a positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via GRETA, a matched human actor, GRETA's voice only (no face) or as text only. Furthermore, versions of GRETA were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in a way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message. Overall, it was found that although GRETA received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likability, presenting the message via GRETA led to the poorest memory performance among users. Importantly, however, when GRETA's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message, the negative effect on memory performance disappeared. Overall, the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - The Use of Artificial Intelligence-Based Conversational Agents (Chatbots) for Weight Loss: Scoping Review and Practical Recommendations
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Background: Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss.
   Objective: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement.
   Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched.
   Results: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality based chatbot interactions in addition to text based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances.
   Conclusions: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss.

TI  - Is Natural Necessary? Human Voice versus Synthetic Voice for Intelligent Virtual Agents
T2  - MULTIMODAL TECHNOLOGIES AND INTERACTION
AB  - The use of intelligent virtual agents (IVA) to support humans in social contexts will depend on their social acceptability. Acceptance will be related to the human's perception of the IVAs as well as the IVAs' ability to respond and adapt their conversation appropriately to the human. Adaptation implies computer-generated speech (synthetic speech), such as text-to-speech (TTS). In this paper, we present the results of a study to investigate the effect of voice type (human voice vs. synthetic voice) on two aspects: (1) the IVA's likeability and voice impression in the light of co-presence, and (2) the interaction outcome, including human-agent trust and behavior change intention. The experiment included 118 participants who interacted with either the virtual advisor with TTS or the virtual advisor with human voice to gain tips for reducing their study stress. Participants in this study found the voice of the virtual advisor with TTS to be more eerie, but they rated both agents, with recorded voice and with TTS, similarly in terms of likeability. They further showed a similar attitude towards both agents in terms of co-presence and building trust. These results challenge previous studies that favor human voice over TTS, and suggest that even if human voice is preferred, TTS can deliver equivalent benefits.

AB  - Persuasion is an attempt of changing individual's behaviors and attitudes. Computer systems which incorporate with an embodied agent can be effective persuasive user interface as a social actor; and we developed and evaluated the persuasive application software which was named "iDetective" as the previous work. The main persuasive strategy of the iDetective was conversations including questions between users and an agent. However, as the result of the user study, those who answered to the question just by curiosity can be decrease the precision of the persuasion. In this research, we focused on the existence of other individuals based on theories related to relationship with other individuals by disclosing answers of one individual to others. Also, we evaluated our method by developing and using a web-based application where a user can have conversation with an agent. As a result, although boredom due to the scarcity of the conversation has more affected than the observation by other members, such disclosure was accepted by most of participants in the settings of this research and we found grounds of further study using the existence of others as a design strategy in the aspect of persuading individuals to provide their real opinion or situation.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 20TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS (ACM IVA 2020)
CP  - 20th ACM International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents (ACM IVA)
AB  - Politeness behaviors could affect individuals' decisions heavily in their daily lives and may therefore also play an important role in human-agent interactions. This study considers the impact of politeness behaviors made by a virtual agent, already in a small face-to-face conversational group with another agent, on a human participant as they approach to join it in a virtual environment displayed on a monitor. The agent uses five verbal and nonverbal politeness strategies, ranging from indirect and implicit to direct and explicit, in an attempt to influence the participant to join the group at an inconvenient location, which requires more time and effort than a direct route that would ignore the invitation of the agent. In addition to assessing the success of the strategies at influencing participant behavior, the participants' perception of the agent's persuasive behavior is assessed in relation to clarity, face loss, positive face, and negative face. Based on results from a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, we found that more direct and explicit politeness strategies have a higher level of success when requesting a participant to join a small group at an inconvenient location, but sometimes negatively impact their perception of the agent. A positive politeness strategy was found to be the most effective for both persuasive success and maintaining a positive impression of the agent.

We present our spoken dialog system design and its evaluation. We developed our dialog system based on Markov decision processes framework and optimized it by using reinforcement learning algorithms with data we collected from real user interactions. The system begins to learn optimal dialog strategies for initiative selection and for the type of confirmations that it uses during the interaction. We compared the unoptimized system with the optimized system in terms of objective measures (e.g. task completion) and subjective measures (e.g. ease of use, future intention to use the system) and obtained positive results.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2ND CONFERENCE ON CONVERSATIONAL USER INTERFACES, CUI 2020
CP  - 2nd Conference on Conversational User Interfaces
AB  - Previous research indicates that synthetic speech can be as persuasive as human speech. However, there is a lack of empirical validation on interactive goal-oriented tasks. In our two-stage study (online listening test and lab evaluation), we compared participants' perception of the persuasiveness of synthetic voices created from speech in a debating style vs. speech from audio-books. Participants interacted with our Conversational Agent (CA) to complete 4 flight-booking tasks and were asked to evaluate the voice, message and perceived personal qualities. We found that participants who interacted with the CA using the voice created from debating style speech rated it as significantly more truthful and more involved than the CA using the audio-book-based voice. However, there was no difference in how frequently each group followed the CA's recommendations. We hope our investigation will provoke discussion about the impact of different synthetic voices on users' perceptions of CAs in goal-oriented tasks.

T2  - EXTENDED ABSTRACTS OF THE 2021 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI'21)
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems
AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) provide an interface modality on smartphones that may be particularly effective for tasks with significant social, affective, reflective, and narrative aspects, such as health education and behavior change counseling. However, the conversational medium is significantly slower than conventional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for brief, time-sensitive tasks. We conducted a randomized experiment to determine user preferences in performing two kinds of health-related tasks-one affective and narrative in nature and one transactional-and gave participants a choice of a conventional GUI or a functionally equivalent ECA on a smartphone to complete the task. We found significant main effects of task type and user preference on user choice of modality, with participants choosing the conventional GUI more often for transactional and time-sensitive tasks.

T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY: DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF PERSONALIZED TECHNOLOGIES TO CHANGE ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS, PERSUASIVE 2017
CP  - 12th International Conference on Persuasive Technologies (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - This study aimed to explore supportive capabilities of VAs with the potential benefit in mind that users of self-guided eHealth interventions could be better supported. Spontaneous empathy and the explicitly expressed intention of non-responsive VAs to deliver user support is likely capable to engage and motivate users. Responsive VAs have even larger potential. However, they are more costly to realize and have a higher risk of failure. Effective user frustration detection and mitigation by Responsive VAs has been empirically demonstrated, but so far within artificial contexts. Altogether it makes sense to further explore the option to add VAs as adjuncts to self-guided eHealth interventions a potential remedy to low adherence.

TI  - Designing Virtual Coaching Solutions
T2  - BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - Especially older persons are prone to disabilities and chronic diseases. These chronic conditions pose a worldwide challenge, leading to deteriorating health, economic strain, loss of life, and a decline in the quality of life (QoL). Therefore, healthcare institutions seek to enhance their strategies for disease prevention and management to uphold the well-being of the community. This leads to the need to regain independence and improve QoL to properly rehabilitate the patients. Virtual Coaches (VCs) in the form of Embodied Conversational Agents are seen as a relevant digital intervention to support the continuity of care. The paper at hand reports on a Design Science Research project about implementing a VC solution to support older patients' home rehabilitation. The study underpins four pivotal design principles: Adaptivity, Coaching Strategy, Multi-user Interface, and Sustainable Infrastructure. The final artifact was tested with 80 patients which were supported in continuing their inpatient rehabilitation at home by using a VC. The evaluation shows both positive results for usability and acceptance of the intervention for four different use cases and a positive impact on the QoL. Given the comprehensive clinical evaluation, the system represents a safe and appealing solution for ensuring the continuity of medical rehabilitation care and the access to personalized cognitive and motor function treatments.

TI  - Chatbots for Sexual Health Improvement: A Systematic Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - There is a rising interest in chatbots dedicated to enhancing sexual health. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of these chatbots, and the current literature lacks sufficient exploration of gaps and patterns in this field. In this review, we provided an overview of the state-of-the-art research conducted on sexual health chatbots, with the goal of identifying prevalent trends, design patterns, and features. In addition, we investigated existing research gaps, challenges, and shortcomings in the landscape of sexual health chatbots. Further, we proposed potential enhancements and directions for future research and development to create more effective chatbots in this field. A systematic search and screening of the literature from the past decade (2013-2023), extracted from seven databases, yielded a total of 1040 studies, out of which 29 articles were included in the final review following screening. The findings suggest that chatbots are usable and effective tools in sexual health education, persuasion, and assistance that are appreciated for their confidentiality, efficiency, and 24/7 availability. However, their performance is hindered by limitations such as restricted scope of knowledge and challenges in understanding user inputs. Additionally, constraints such as text-only input/output modalities and a predominant reliance on the English language limit their accessibility and acceptability. There is also a crucial need for more research in low-income or lower-middle-income countries, where individuals require increased sexual health education and support.

TI  - Collaboratively Setting Daily Step Goals with a Virtual Coach: Using Reinforcement Learning to Personalize Initial Proposals
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2024
CP  - 19th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - Goal-setting is commonly used in behavior change applications for physical activity. However, for goals to be effective, they need to be tailored to a user's situation (e.g., motivation, progress). One way to obtain such goals is a collaborative process in which a healthcare professional and client set a goal together, thus making use of the professional's expertise and the client's knowledge about their own situation. As healthcare professionals are not always available, we created a dialog with the virtual coach Steph to collaboratively set daily step goals. Since judgments in human decision-making processes are adjusted based on the starting point or anchor, the first step goal proposal Steph makes is likely to influence the user's final goal and self-efficacy. Situational factors impacting physical activity (e.g., motivation, self-efficacy, available time) or how users process information (e.g., mood) may determine which initial proposals are most effective in getting users to reach their underlying previous activity-based recommended step goals. Using data from 117 people interacting with Steph for up to five days, we designed a reinforcement learning algorithm that considers users' current and future situations when choosing an initial step goal proposal. Our simulations show that initial step goal proposals matter: choosing optimal ones based on this algorithm could make it more likely that people move to a situation with high motivation, high self-efficacy, and a favorable daily context. Then, they are more likely to achieve, but also to overachieve, their underlying recommended step goals. Our dataset is publicly available.

TI  - Cocreation of a conversational agent to help patients adhere to their varenicline treatment: A study protocol
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveVarenicline is the most efficacious approved smoking cessation medication, making it one of the most cost-effective clinical interventions for reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Adhering to varenicline is strongly associated with smoking cessation. Healthbots have the potential to help people adhere to their medications by scaling up evidence-based behavioral interventions. In this protocol, we outline how we will follow the UK's Medical Research Council's guidance to codesign a theory-informed, evidence-based, and patient-centered healthbot to help people adhere to varenicline. MethodsThe study will utilize the Discover, Design and Build, and Test framework and will include three phases: (a) a rapid review and interviews with 20 patients and 20 healthcare providers to understand barriers and facilitators to varenicline adherence (Discover phase); (b) Wizard of Oz test to design the healthbot and get a sense of the questions that chatbot has to be able to answer (Design phase); and (c) building, training, and beta-testing the healthbot (Building and Testing phases) where the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability framework will be used to develop the healthbot using the simplest sensible solution, and 20 participants will beta test the healthbot. We will use the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model of behavior change and its associated framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework, to organize the findings. ConclusionsThe present approach will enable us to systematically identify the most appropriate features for the healthbot based on a well-established behavioral theory, the latest scientific evidence, and end users' and healthcare providers' knowledge.

TI  - Towards a New Approach to Increasing the Persuasion of Product Marketing: An Experimental Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF ROBOTICS NETWORKING AND ARTIFICIAL LIFE
AB  - Modern marketing strategies that leverage technology to of-fer significant value for the client have replaced conventional selling techniques in recent years. A conversational agent or dialogue system presents an interactive computing product as a means of influencing people's opinions. However, this expanding topic still had limits in the earlier study. To advance this field, the current experimental study incorporates new elements that are re-quired to enhance the ability to persuade and build a compelling case for product advertising. Research in the past has shown that emotional branding is essential to strengthen the customer's engagement. Therefore, in this study, we created six contents, conducted an experiment with Japanese participants, and analyzed how to persuade them with emotional and cultural content using a sinking boat joke. A sinking boat joke is a joke about convincing people to jump into the water when a boat is ready to sink, which incorporates a cultural context. The experiment was conducted by recruiting Japanese students at a Japanese university. Contents were presented in a counterbalanced way. The goal is to ascertain which emotion works best for advertising, to investigate cultural differences, and to analyze the content effectiveness that successfully persuades the Japanese participants.

TI  - Towards personalized persuasive dialogue generation for adversarial task oriented dialogue setting
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - In recent years, task-oriented virtual assistants have gained huge popularity and demand in both research and industry communities. The primary aim of a task-oriented dialogue agent is to assist end-users in accomplishing a task successfully and satisfactorily. Existing virtual agents have acquired proficiency in assisting users in solving simple tasks such as restaurant bookings. However, they operate under the deterministic presumption that end-users will have a servable task objective, which makes them inadequate under adversarial situations such as goal unavailability. On the other hand, human agents accomplish users' tasks even in many goal unavailability scenarios by persuading them towards a similar goal to the user's proposed task. Motivated by the limitation, the current work proposes and builds a novel transformer-based context-aware personalized persuasive virtual assistant (CoPersUasive VA), which also serves end-users in task unavailability situations. The proposed CoPersUasive VA recognizes goal conflicts through user sentiment and identifies an appropriate persuasion strategy using ongoing dialogue context and user personality. Depending on users' proposed goals, it finds a similar servable goal and persuades them with the identified persuasion strategy. The obtained experimental results and detailed post-analysis firmly establish that the proposed model effectively enhances the capability of task-oriented virtual assistants to deal with the task failures caused by goal unavailability. The obtained findings also suggest the crucial role of dialogue context in identifying an appropriate and appealing persuasion strategy. The proposed CoPersUasive model could easily be adapted to any other domain by fine-tuning the model on an underlying task. Furthermore, we developed a personalized persuasive multi-intent conversational dialogue corpus annotated with intent, slot, sentiment, and dialogue act for electronic domain.2

TI  - What Drives Consumers' Decisions to Use Intelligent Agent Technologies? A Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERNET COMMERCE
AB  - As artificial intelligence continues to advance, it will increasingly empower the successful use of intelligent agent (IA) technologies in marketing practices. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the state-of-the-art literature and present a holistic view of different types of antecedents of IA technology use in marketing from the consumer's perspective. This paper uses the systematic literature review method and covers 107 articles published in scientific journals between 2000 and 2020. The identified antecedents are categorized into IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external conditions, as well as individual characteristics and analyzed at the individual level of use. Future research should focus on investigating the relative importance of the effects of IA characteristics, consumer perceptions, external, and individual factors on consumers' intentions to use IAs. This paper argues that while extant technology acceptance models contribute to the understanding of IA use, IAs, due to their unique characteristics (e.g., anthropomorphism) and dimensions (e.g., IA as an interface, as a proxy for the system and an autonomous aggregator and agent), require a new lens to explain the drivers of IA use in data-rich and process-rich environments. The traditional technology acceptance theories provide a valuable, yet incomplete understanding of how consumers use IAs. Drawing from representation theory, this paper proposes a theoretical framework of IA use and argues that IAs act as representations to facilitate the primary goal.

TI  - A persona aware persuasive dialogue policy for dynamic and co-operative goal setting
T2  - EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS
AB  - Contextualization: In recent years, the popularity of virtual agents particularly task-oriented dialogue agents has increased immensely due to their effectiveness and simplicity in various domains such as industry, e-commerce, and health. Problem: In real-world, users do not have always a predefined and immutable goal, i.e., they may upgrade/downgrade/update their task goal dynamically depending upon their utility and the serving capability of the assisting agent. However, the existing Virtual Agents (VAs) in the dialogue literature relinquish and yield dialogue failure if they find any dynamic goal setting or goal unavailability scenarios. Contributions and methodology: Motivated by these inabilities of existing VAs, we propose some intelligent and expert Dialogue Agents (A Unified Dialogue Agent and Multi-agent Dialogue system) that can deal with dynamic and goal unavailability situations to elevate both user satisfaction and the agent's utility particularly task success rate. The proposed architecture incorporates a goal guiding module namely Dynamic and Co Operative Goal Driven Module (DyCoGDM), which traces goal status and resolves goal discrepancy through dynamic goal setting (Goal Formulator) and personalized persuasion (Goal Persuader) mechanisms. We also created and annotated a dialogue corpus because of unavailability of such corpus featured with dynamic and goal unavailability scenarios. Findings and implications: Our proposed method outperforms several baselines and state of the art methods in all evaluation metrics. The proposed VA is capable of dealing with dynamic goals and goal unavailability scenarios effectively. The study found that the persona aware persuasive dialogue agent outperforms generalized persuasive dialogue agent by a large margin. Furthermore, we also observed that the task oriented reward is the most essential reward for training a reinforcement learning based agent and agents trained without task based reward do not even converge.

TI  - Testing the comparative effects of physical activity advice by humans vs. computers in underserved populations: The COMPASS trial design, methods, and baseline characteristics
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - While physical inactivity is a key risk factor for a range of chronic diseases and conditions associated with aging, a significant proportion of midlife and older adults remain insufficiently active. This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. The major objective of this 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial is to test the comparative effectiveness of two linguistically and culturally adapted, community-based physical activity interventions with the potential for broad reach and translation. Ten local community centers serving a sizable number of Latino residents were randomized to receive one of two physical activity interventions. The Virtual Advisor program employs a computer-based embodied conversational agent named "Carmen" to deliver interactive, individually tailored physical activity advice and support. A similar intervention program is delivered by trained Peer Advisors. The target population consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 50 years and older living within proximity to a designated community center. The major outcomes are changes in walking and other forms of physical activity measured via self-report and accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include physical function and well-being variables. In addition to these outcome analyses, comparative cost analysis of the two programs, potential mediators of intervention success, and baseline moderators of intervention effects will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention. Here we present the study design and methods, including recruitment strategies and yield as well as study baseline characteristics.

TI  - Using the Wizard of Oz method to train persuasive agents
T2  - COOPERATIVE INFORMATION AGENTS XII, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 12th International Workshop on Cooperative Information Agents
AB  - Persuasive conversational agents persuade users to change their attitudes or behaviors through conversation and are expected to be applied as virtual sales-clerks in e-shopping sites. Developing Such an agent requires a conversation model that identifies the most appropriate responses to file user's inputs. To create Such a model, we propose the approach of combining a learning agent with the Wizard of Oz method: in this approach, it person (called the Wizard) talks to the user pretending to be the agent. The agent learns from the conversations between the Wizard and the user and constructs its own conversation model. In this approach, the Wizard has to reply to most of the user's inputs at the beginning. but the burden gradually falls because the agent learns how to reply as the conversation model grows.
   Every persuasive conversation has the goal of persuading the user and ends with success or failure. We introduce a goal-oriented conversation model that can represent the success probability of persuasion and it learning method to update the model depending on the success/failure of the persuasive conversation. We introduce a learning persuasive agent that implements the conversation model and the learning method and evaluate it in the situation wherein the agent persuades users to choose one type of digital camera over another. The agent Could succeed in reducing the Wizard's inputs by 48%, and, more interestingly, succeeded in persuading 2 users without any help from the Wizard.

TI  - Protocol of a mixed-methods evaluation of Perfect Fit: A personalized mHealth intervention with a virtual coach to promote smoking cessation and physical activity in adults
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective Adopting healthy behavior is vital for preventing chronic diseases. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions utilizing virtual coaches (i.e., artificial intelligence conversational agents) can offer scalable and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, targeting multiple unhealthy behaviors, like low physical activity and smoking, simultaneously seems beneficial. We developed Perfect Fit, an mHealth intervention with a virtual coach providing personalized feedback to simultaneously promote smoking cessation and physical activity. Through innovative methods (e.g., sensor technology) and iterative development involving end-users, we strive to overcome challenges encountered by mHealth interventions, such as shortage of evidence-based interventions and insufficient personalization. This paper outlines the content of Perfect Fit and the protocol for evaluating its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness, the role of participant characteristics, and the study's feasibility.Methods A single-arm, mixed-method, real-world evaluation study will be conducted in the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 100 adult daily smokers intending to quit within 6 weeks. The personalized intervention will last approximately 16 weeks. Primary outcomes include Perfect Fit's feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes are preliminary effectiveness and study feasibility, and we will measure participant characteristics. Quantitative data will be collected through questionnaires administered at baseline, post-intervention and 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Qualitative data will be gathered via semi-structured interviews post-intervention. Data analysis will involve descriptive analyses, generalized linear mixed models (quantitative) and the Framework Approach (qualitative), integrating quantitative and qualitative data during interpretation.Conclusions This study will provide novel insight into the potential of interventions like Perfect Fit, as a multiple health behavior change strategy. Findings will inform further intervention development and help identify methods to foster feasibility and acceptability. Successful mHealth interventions with virtual coaches will prevent chronic diseases and promote public health.

TI  - A formal understanding of computational empathy in interactive agents
T2  - COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB  - Interactive software agents, such as chatbots, are progressively being used in the area of health and well-being. In such applications, where agents engage with users in interpersonal conversations for, e.g., coaching, comfort or behavior -change interventions, there is an increased need for understanding agents' empathic capabilities. In the current state-of-the-art, there are no tools to do that. In order to understand empathic capabilities in interactive software agents, we need a precise notion of empathy. The literature discusses a variety of definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus of a formal definition. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, a formal definition-an ontology-of empathy is developed. We present the potential of the formal definition in a controlled user -study by applying it as a tool for assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots; Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition captures necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents, and how it can uncover and explain trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. The definition, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), may serve as an automated tool, enabling systems to recognize empathy in interactions-be it an interactive agent evaluating its own empathic performance or an intelligent system assessing the empathic capability of its interlocutors.

TI  - A mobile healthy lifestyle intervention to promote mental health in adolescence: a mixed-methods evaluation
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background A healthy lifestyle may improve mental health. It is yet not known whether and how a mobile intervention can be of help in achieving this in adolescents. This study investigated the effectiveness and perceived underlying mechanisms of the mobile health (mHealth) intervention #LIFEGOALS to promote healthy lifestyles and mental health. #LIFEGOALS is an evidence-based app with activity tracker, including self-regulation techniques, gamification elements, a support chatbot, and health narrative videos.Methods A quasi-randomized controlled trial (N = 279) with 12-week intervention period and process evaluation interviews (n = 13) took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents (12-15y) from the general population were allocated at school-level to the intervention (n = 184) or to a no-intervention group (n = 95). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, peer support, resilience, depressed feelings, sleep quality and breakfast frequency were assessed via a web-based survey; physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep routine via Axivity accelerometers. Multilevel generalized linear models were fitted to investigate intervention effects and moderation by pandemic-related measures. Interviews were coded using thematic analysis.Results Non-usage attrition was high: 18% of the participants in the intervention group never used the app. An additional 30% stopped usage by the second week. Beneficial intervention effects were found for physical activity (chi(2)(1) = 4.36, P = .04), sedentary behavior (chi(2)(1) = 6.44, P = .01), sleep quality (chi(2)(1) = 6.11, P = .01), and mood (chi(2)(1) = 2.30, P = .02). However, effects on activity-related behavior were only present for adolescents having normal sports access, and effects on mood only for adolescents with full in-school education. HRQoL (chi(2)(2) = 14.72, P < .001), mood (chi(2)(1) = 6.03, P = .01), and peer support (chi(2)(1) = 13.69, P < .001) worsened in adolescents with pandemic-induced remote-education. Interviewees reported that the reward system, self-regulation guidance, and increased health awareness had contributed to their behavior change. They also pointed to the importance of social factors, quality of technology and autonomy for mHealth effectiveness.Conclusions #LIFEGOALS showed mixed results on health behaviors and mental health. The findings highlight the role of contextual factors for mHealth promotion in adolescence, and provide suggestions to optimize support by a chatbot and narrative episodes.

TI  - Development of an Alcohol Refusal Training in Immersive Virtual Reality for Patients With Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disability and Alcohol Use Disorder: Cocreation With Experts in Addiction Care
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: People with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID; IQ=50-85) are at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). One factor contributing to this risk is sensitivity to peer pressure. Hence, tailored trainings are needed to practice alcohol refusal in impacted patients. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) appears promising to engage patients in dialogs with virtual humans, allowing to practice alcohol refusal realistically. However, requirements for such an IVR have not been studied for MBID/AUD.Objective: This study aims to develop an IVR alcohol refusal training for patients with MBID and AUD. In this work, we cocreated our peer pressure simulation with experienced experts in addiction care. Methods: We followed the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model to develop our IVR alcohol refusal training. With 5 experts from a Dutch addiction clinic for patients with MBID, we held 3 focus groups to design the virtual environment, persuasive virtual human(s), and persuasive dialog. Subsequently, we developed our initial IVR prototype and conducted another focus group to evaluate IVR and procedures for clinical usage, resulting in our final peer pressure simulation.Results: Our experts described visiting a friend at home with multiple friends as the most relevant peer pressure situation in the clinical setting. Based on the identified requirements, we developed a social-housing apartment with multiple virtual friends present. Moreover, we embedded a virtual man with generic appearance to exert peer pressure using a persuasive dialog. Patients can respond to persuasive attempts by selecting (refusal) responses with varying degrees of risk for relapse in alcohol use. Our evaluation showed that experts value a realistic and interactable IVR. However, experts identified lacking persuasive design elements, such as paralanguage, for our virtual human. For clinical usage, a user-centered customization is needed to prevent adverse effects. Further, interventions should be therapist delivered to avoid try-and-error in patients with MBID. Lastly, we identified factors for immersion, as well as facilitators and barriers for IVR accessibility.Conclusions: Our work establishes an initial PSD for IVR for alcohol refusal trainings in patients with MBID and AUD. With this, scholars can create comparable simulations by performing an analogous cocreation, replicate findings, and identify active PSD elements. For peer pressure, conveying emotional information in a virtual human's voice (eg, paralanguage) seems vital. However, previous rapport building may be needed to ensure that virtual humans are perceived as cognitively capable entities. Future work should validate our PSD with patients and start developing IVR treatment protocols using interdisciplinary teams.

TI  - A systematic review of artificial intelligence chatbots for promoting physical activity, healthy diet, and weight loss
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF BEHAVIORAL NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
AB  - Background: This systematic review aimed to evaluate Al chatbot characteristics, functions, and core conversational capacities and investigate whether Al chatbot interventions were effective in changing physical activity, healthy eating, weight management behaviors, and other related health outcomes.
   Methods: In collaboration with a medical librarian, six electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and IEEE) were searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. The National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used to assess risk of bias in individual studies. We applied the Al Chatbot Behavior Change Model to characterize components of chatbot interventions, including chatbot characteristics, persuasive and relational capacity, and evaluation of outcomes.
   Results: The database search retrieved 1692 citations, and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 4 were randomized controlled trials and 5 were quasi-experimental studies. Five out of the seven studies suggest chatbot interventions are promising strategies in increasing physical activity. In contrast, the number of studies focusing on changing diet and weight status was limited. Outcome assessments, however, were reported inconsistently across the studies. Eighty-nine and thirty-three percent of the studies specified a name and gender (i.e., woman) of the chatbot, respectively. Over half (56%) of the studies used a constrained chatbot (i.e., rule-based), while the remaining studies used unconstrained chatbots that resemble human-to-human communication.
   Conclusion: Chatbots may improve physical activity, but we were not able to make definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of chatbot interventions on physical activity, diet, and weight management/loss. Application of AI chatbots is an emerging field of research in lifestyle modification programs and is expected to grow exponentially. Thus, standardization of designing and reporting chatbot interventions is warranted in the near future.

TI  - A Review of Sensor-Based Interventions for Supporting Patient Adherence to Inhalation Therapy
T2  - PATIENT PREFERENCE AND ADHERENCE
AB  - Purpose: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sensor technologies employed in interventions to enhance patient adherence to inhalation therapy for chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular emphasis on human factors. Sensor-based interventions offer opportunities to improve adherence through monitoring and feedback; however, a deeper understanding of how these technologies interact with patients is essential. Patients and Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ACM Digital Library, spanning the timeframe from January 2014 to December 2023. Our inclusion criteria focused on studies that employed sensor-based technologies to enhance patient adherence to inhalation therapy. Results: The initial search yielded 1563 results. After a thorough screening process, we selected 37 relevant studies. These sensor- based interventions were organized within a comprehensive HFE framework, including data collection, data processing, system feedback, and system feasibility. The data collection phase comprised person-related, task-related, and physical environment-related data. Various approaches to data processing were employed, encompassing applications for assessing intervention effectiveness, monitoring patient behaviour, and identifying disease risks, while system feedback included reminders and alerts, data visualization, and persuasive features. System feasibility was evaluated based on patient acceptance, usability, and device cost considerations. Conclusion: Sensor-based interventions hold significant promise for improving adherence to inhalation therapy. This review highlights the necessity of an integrated "person-task-physical environment" system to advance future sensor technologies. By capturing comprehensive data on patient health, device usage patterns, and environmental conditions, this approach enables more personalized and effective adherence support. Key recommendations include standardizing data integration protocols, employing advanced algorithms for insights generation, enhancing interactive visual features for accessibility, integrating persuasive design elements to boost engagement, exploring the advantages of conversational agents, and optimizing experience to increase patient acceptance.

TI  - Setting Physical Activity Goals with a Virtual Coach: Vicarious Experiences, Personalization and Acceptance
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS
AB  - Goal-setting is often used in eHealth applications for behavior change as it motivates and helps to stay focused on a desired outcome. However, for goals to be effective, they need to meet criteria such as being specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). Moreover, people need to be confident to reach their goal. We thus created a goal-setting dialog in which the virtual coach Jody guided people in setting SMART goals. Thereby, Jody provided personalized vicarious experiences by showing examples from other people who reached a goal to increase people's confidence. These experiences were personalized, as it is helpful to observe a relatable other succeed. Data from an online study with a between-subjects with pre-post measurement design (n=39 participants) provide credible support that personalized experiences are seen as more motivating than generic ones. Motivational factors for participants included information about the goal, path to the goal, and the person who accomplished a goal, as well as the mere fact that a goal was reached. Participants also had a positive attitude toward Jody. We see these results as an indication that people are positive toward using a goal-setting dialog with a virtual coach in eHealth applications for behavior change. Moreover, contrary to hypothesized, our observed data give credible support that participants' self-efficacy was lower after the dialog than before. These results warrant further research on how such dialogs affect self-efficacy, especially whether these lower post-measurements of self-efficacy are associated with people's more realistic assessment of their abilities.

TI  - Digital preconception interventions targeting weight, diet and physical activity: A systematic review
T2  - NUTRITION & DIETETICS
AB  - AimOptimising preconception health increases the likelihood of conception, positively influences short- and long-term pregnancy outcomes and reduces intergenerational chronic disease risk. Our aim was to synthesise study characteristics and maternal outcomes of digital or blended (combining face to face and digital modalities) interventions in the preconception period.MethodsWe searched six databases (PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, Web of Science, CINHAL and PsycINFO) from 1990 to November 2022 according to the PRISMA guidelines for randomised control trials, quasi-experimental trials, observation studies with historical control group. Studies were included if they targeted women of childbearing age, older than 18 years, who were not currently pregnant and were between pregnancies or/and actively trying to conceive. Interventions had to be delivered digitally or via digital health in combination with face-to-face delivery and aimed to improve modifiable behaviours, including dietary intake, physical activity, weight and supplementation. Studies that included women diagnosed with type 1 or 2 diabetes were excluded. Risk of bias was assessed using the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics quality criteria checklist. Study characteristics, intervention characteristics and outcome data were extracted.ResultsTen studies (total participants n=4,461) were included, consisting of nine randomised control trials and one pre-post cohort study. Seven studies received a low risk of bias and two received a neutral risk of bias. Four were digitally delivered and six were delivered using blended modalities. A wide range of digital delivery modalities were employed, with the most common being email and text messaging. Other digital delivery methods included web-based educational materials, social media, phone applications, online forums and online conversational agents. Studies with longer engagement that utilised blended delivery showed greater weight loss.ConclusionMore effective interventions appear to combine both traditional and digital delivery methods. More research is needed to adequately test effective delivery modalities across a diverse range of digital delivery methods, as high heterogeneity was observed across the small number of included studies.

TI  - Designing Persuasive Food Conversational Recommender Systems With Nudging and Socially-Aware Conversational Strategies
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ROBOTICS AND AI
AB  - Unhealthy eating behavior is a major public health issue with serious repercussions on an individual's health. One potential solution to overcome this problem, and help people change their eating behavior, is to develop conversational systems able to recommend healthy recipes. One challenge for such systems is to deliver personalized recommendations matching users' needs and preferences. Beyond the intrinsic quality of the recommendation itself, various factors might also influence users' perception of a recommendation. In this paper, we present Cora, a conversational system that recommends recipes aligned with its users' eating habits and current preferences. Users can interact with Cora in two different ways. They can select pre-defined answers by clicking on buttons to talk to Cora or write text in natural language. Additionally, Cora can engage users through a social dialogue, or go straight to the point. Cora is also able to propose different alternatives and to justify its recipes recommendation by explaining the trade-off between them. We conduct two experiments. In the first one, we evaluate the impact of Cora's conversational skills and users' interaction mode on users' perception and intention to cook the recommended recipes. Our results show that a conversational recommendation system that engages its users through a rapport-building dialogue improves users' perception of the interaction as well as their perception of the system. In the second evaluation, we evaluate the influence of Cora's explanations and recommendation comparisons on users' perception. Our results show that explanations positively influence users' perception of a recommender system. However, comparing healthy recipes with a decoy is a double-edged sword. Although such comparison is perceived as significantly more useful compared to one single healthy recommendation, explaining the difference between the decoy and the healthy recipe would actually make people less likely to use the system.

TI  - Considering patient safety in autonomous e-mental health systems - detecting risk situations and referring patients back to human care
T2  - BMC MEDICAL INFORMATICS AND DECISION MAKING
AB  - Background: Digital health interventions can fill gaps in mental healthcare provision. However, autonomous e-mental health (AEMH) systems also present challenges for effective risk management. To balance autonomy and safety, AEMH systems need to detect risk situations and act on these appropriately. One option is sending automatic alerts to carers, but such 'auto-referral' could lead to missed cases or false alerts. Requiring users to actively self-refer offers an alternative, but this can also be risky as it relies on their motivation to do so. This study set out with two objectives. Firstly, to develop guidelines for risk detection and auto-referral systems. Secondly, to understand how persuasive techniques, mediated by a virtual agent, can facilitate self-referral.
   Methods: In a formative phase, interviews with experts, alongside a literature review, were used to develop a risk detection protocol. Two referral protocols were developed - one involving auto-referral, the other motivating users to self-refer. This latter was tested via crowd-sourcing (n = 160). Participants were asked to imagine they had sleeping problems with differing severity and user stance on seeking help. They then chatted with a virtual agent, who either directly facilitated referral, tried to persuade the user, or accepted that they did not want help. After the conversation, participants rated their intention to self-refer, to chat with the agent again, and their feeling of being heard by the agent.
   Results: Whether the virtual agent facilitated, persuaded or accepted, influenced all of these measures. Users who were initially negative or doubtful about self-referral could be persuaded. For users who were initially positive about seeking human care, this persuasion did not affect their intentions, indicating that a simply facilitating referral without persuasion was sufficient.
   Conclusion: This paper presents a protocol that elucidates the steps and decisions involved in risk detection, something that is relevant for all types of AEMH systems. In the case of self-referral, our study shows that a virtual agent can increase users' intention to self-refer. Moreover, the strategy of the agent influenced the intentions of the user afterwards. This highlights the importance of a personalised approach to promote the user's access to appropriate care.

TI  - MoveONParkinson: developing a personalized motivational solution for Parkinson's disease management
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Introduction Despite the effectiveness of exercise-based interventions on symptom management and disease progression, many people with Parkinson's Disease (PwPD) do not exercise regularly. In line with the ubiquitous use of digital health technology, the MoveONParkinson digital solution was developed, comprising a Web Platform and a Mobile App with a Conversational Agent (CA). The interface features were designed based on the principles of Social Cognitive Theory with the goal of fostering behavior change in PwPD for sustained exercise participation and improved disease management.Methods Using a mixed methods approach, this study aimed to collect feedback, assess the acceptability of the Mobile App and the Web Platform, and evaluate the usability of the latter. Quantitative data, which included questionnaire responses and the System Usability Scale (SUS) scores, were analyzed using descriptive statistics, heatmaps, and correlation matrices. Qualitative data, comprising semi-structured and thinking-aloud interview transcripts, were subjected to an inductive thematic analysis. A total of 28 participants were involved in the study, comprising 20 physiotherapists (average age: 34.50 +/- 10.4), and eight PwPD (average age: 65.75 +/- 8.63; mean Hoehn & Yahr: 2.0 (+/- 0.76)).Results Three main themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the interviews, namely: Self-management (Theme 1), User Engagement (Theme 2), and Recommendations (Theme 3). The assessment of the Mobile App and the CA (mean score: 4.42/5.0 +/- 0.79) suggests that PwPD were able to navigate this interface without notable difficulties. The mean SUS score of 79.50 (+/- 12.40%) with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 73.70 to 85.30, reveal good usability.Discussion These findings indicate a high level of acceptability of the MoveONParkinson digital solution, serving as a foundation for assessing its impact on exercise engagement and, subsequently, its influence on symptom management and quality of life of PwPD.

TI  - Users' needs for a digital smoking cessation application and how to address them: A mixed-methods study
T2  - PEERJ
AB  - Background: Despite their increasing prevalence and potential, eHealth applications for behavior change suffer from a lack of adherence and from dropout. Advances in virtual coach technology provide new opportunities to improve this. However, these applications still do not always offer what people need. We, therefore, need a better understanding of people's needs and how to address these, based on both actual experiences of users and their reflections on envisioned scenarios. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in which 671 smokers interacted with a virtual coach in five sessions. The virtual coach assigned them a new preparatory activity for quitting smoking or increasing physical activity in each session. Participants provided feedback on the activity in the next session. After the five sessions, participants were asked to describe barriers and motivators for doing their activities. In addition, they provided their views on videos of scenarios such as receiving motivational messages. To understand users' needs, we took a mixed-methods approach. This approach triangulated findings from qualitative data, quantitative data, and the literature. Results: We identified 14 main themes that describe people's views of their current and future behaviors concerning an eHealth application. These themes relate to the behaviors themselves, the users, other parties involved in a behavior, and the environment. The most prevalent theme was the perceived usefulness of behaviors, especially whether they were informative, helpful, motivating, or encouraging. The timing and intensity of behaviors also mattered. With regards to the users, their perceived importance of and motivation to change, autonomy, and personal characteristics were major themes. Another important role was played by other parties that may be involved in a behavior, such as general practitioners or virtual coaches. Here, the themes of companionableness, accountability, and nature of the other party (i.e., human vs AI) were relevant. The last set of main themes was related to the environment in which a behavior is performed. Prevalent themes were the availability of sufficient time, the presence of prompts and triggers, support from one's social environment, and the diversity of other environmental factors. We provide recommendations for addressing each theme. Conclusions: The integrated method of experience-based and envisioning-based needs acquisition with a triangulate analysis provided a comprehensive needs classification (empirically and theoretically grounded). We expect that our themes and recommendations for addressing them will be helpful for designing applications for health behavior change that meet people's needs. Designers should especially focus on the perceived usefulness of application components. To aid future work, we publish our dataset with user characteristics and 5,074 free-text responses from 671 people.

TI  - Conversational AI and Vaccine Communication: Systematic Review of the Evidence
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Since the mid-2010s, use of conversational artificial intelligence (AI; chatbots) in health care has expanded significantly, especially in the context of increased burdens on health systems and restrictions on in-person consultations with health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. One emerging use for conversational AI is to capture evolving questions and communicate information about vaccines and vaccination.
   Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to examine documented uses and evidence on the effectiveness of conversational AI for vaccine communication.
   Methods: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Embase, Epistemonikos, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, Academic Search Complete, and the University of London library database were searched for papers on the use of conversational AI for vaccine communication. The inclusion criteria were studies that included (1) documented instances of conversational AI being used for the purpose of vaccine communication and (2) evaluation data on the impact and effectiveness of the intervention.
   Results: After duplicates were removed, the review identified 496 unique records, which were then screened by title and abstract, of which 38 were identified for full-text review. Seven fit the inclusion criteria and were assessed and summarized in the findings of this review. Overall, vaccine chatbots deployed to date have been relatively simple in their design and have mainly been used to provide factual information to users in response to their questions about vaccines. Additionally, chatbots have been used for vaccination scheduling, appointment reminders, debunking misinformation, and, in some cases, for vaccine counseling and persuasion. Available evidence suggests that chatbots can have a positive effect on vaccine attitudes; however, studies were typically exploratory in nature, and some lacked a control group or had very small sample sizes.
   Conclusions: The review found evidence of potential benefits from conversational AI for vaccine communication. Factors that may contribute to the effectiveness of vaccine chatbots include their ability to provide credible and personalized information in real time, the familiarity and accessibility of the chatbot platform, and the extent to which interactions with the chatbot feel "natural" to users. However, evaluations have focused on the short-term, direct effects of chatbots on their users. The potential longer-term and societal impacts of conversational AI have yet to be analyzed. In addition, existing studies do not adequately address how ethics apply in the field of conversational AI around vaccines. In a context where further digitalization of vaccine communication can be anticipated, additional high-quality research will be required across all these areas.

TI  - Active Assistance Technology for Health-Related Behavior Change: An Interdisciplinary Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Information technology can help individuals to change their health behaviors. This is due to its potential for dynamic and unbiased information processing enabling users to monitor their own progress and be informed about risks and opportunities specific to evolving contexts and motivations. However, in many behavior change interventions, information technology is underused by treating it as a passive medium focused on efficient transmission of information and a positive user experience.
   Objective: To conduct an interdisciplinary literature review to determine the extent to which the active technological capabilities of dynamic and adaptive information processing are being applied in behavior change interventions and to identify their role in these interventions.
   Methods: We defined key categories of active technology such as semantic information processing, pattern recognition, and adaptation. We conducted the literature search using keywords derived from the categories and included studies that indicated a significant role for an active technology in health-related behavior change. In the data extraction, we looked specifically for the following technology roles: (1) dynamic adaptive tailoring of messages depending on context, (2) interactive education, (3) support for client self-monitoring of behavior change progress, and (4) novel ways in which interventions are grounded in behavior change theories using active technology.
   Results: The search returned 228 potentially relevant articles, of which 41 satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that significant research was focused on dialog systems, embodied conversational agents, and activity recognition. The most covered health topic was physical activity. The majority of the studies were early-stage research. Only 6 were randomized controlled trials, of which 4 were positive for behavior change and 5 were positive for acceptability. Empathy and relational behavior were significant research themes in dialog systems for behavior change, with many pilot studies showing a preference for those features. We found few studies that focused on interactive education (3 studies) and self-monitoring (2 studies). Some recent research is emerging in dynamic tailoring (15 studies) and theoretically grounded ontologies for automated semantic processing (4 studies).
   Conclusions: The potential capabilities and risks of active assistance technologies are not being fully explored in most current behavior change research. Designers of health behavior interventions need to consider the relevant informatics methods and algorithms more fully. There is also a need to analyze the possibilities that can result from interaction between different technology components. This requires deep interdisciplinary collaboration, for example, between health psychology, computer science, health informatics, cognitive science, and educational methodology.

TI  - Development of Chatbot-Based Oral Health Care for Young Children and Evaluation of its Effectiveness, Usability, and Acceptability: Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR PEDIATRICS AND PARENTING
AB  - Background: Chatbots are increasingly accepted in public health for their ability to replicate human-like communication and provide scalable, 24/7 services. The high prevalence of dental caries in children underscores the need for early and effective intervention. Objective: This study aimed to develop the 30-Day FunDee chatbot and evaluate its effectiveness, usability, and acceptability in delivering oral health education to caregivers of children aged 6 to 36 months. Methods: The chatbot was created using the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot behavior change model, integrating behavioral change theories into content designed for 3-5 minutes of daily use over 30 days. A pre-post experimental study was conducted from December 2021 to February 2022 in Hat Yai District, Songkhla Province, and Maelan District, Pattani Province, Thailand. Fifty-eight caregivers completed a web-based structured questionnaire at baseline and 2 months post baseline to evaluate knowledge, protection motivation theory-based perceptions, and tooth-brushing practices. Usability was assessed via chatbot logfiles and a web-based questionnaire at 2 months post baseline. Acceptability was evaluated through three methods: (1) open-ended chatbot interactions on day 30, (2) a web-based structured questionnaire at 2 months post baseline, and (3) semistructured telephone interviews with 15 participants 2 weeks post intervention. Participants for interviews were stratified by adherence levels and randomly selected from Hatyai and Maelan districts. All self-reported variables were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1=lowest, 5=highest). Results: The chatbot was successfully developed based on the 4 components of the AI chatbot behavior change model. Participants had a mean age of 34.5 (SD 8.6) years. The frequency of tooth brushing among caregivers significantly improved, increasing from 72.4% at baseline to 93.1% two months post baseline (P=.006). Protection motivation theory-based perceptions also showed significant improvement, with mean scores rising from 4.0 (SD 0.6) at baseline to 4.5 (SD 0.6) two months post baseline (P<.001). The chatbot received high ratings for satisfaction (4.7/5, SD 0.6) and usability (4.7/5, SD 0.5). Participants engaged with the chatbot for an average of 24.7 (SD 7.2) days out of 30. Caregivers praised the chatbot's content quality, empathetic communication, and multimedia design, but noted the intervention's lengthy duration and messaging system as limitations. Conclusions: The 30-Day FunDee chatbot effectively enhanced caregivers' perceptions of oral health care and improved tooth-brushing practices for children aged 6-36 months. High user satisfaction and engagement demonstrate its potential as an innovative tool for oral health education. These findings warrant further validation through large-scale, randomized controlled trials.

TI  - Human Factors in AI-Driven Digital Solutions for Increasing Physical Activity: Scoping Review
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance physical activity (PA) interventions. However, human factors (HFs) play a pivotal role in the successful integration of AI into mobile health (mHealth) solutions for promoting PA. Understanding and optimizing the interaction between individuals and AI -driven mHealth apps is essential for achieving the desired outcomes. Objective: This study aims to review and describe the current evidence on the HFs in AI -driven digital solutions for increasing PA. Methods: We conducted a scoping review by searching for publications containing terms related to PA, HFs, and AI in the titles and abstracts across 3 databases-PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore-and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they were primary studies describing an AI-based solution aimed at increasing PA, and results from testing the solution were reported. Studies that did not meet these criteria were excluded. Additionally, we searched the references in the included articles for relevant research. The following data were extracted from included studies and incorporated into a qualitative synthesis: bibliographic information, study characteristics, population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and AI-related information. The certainty of the evidence in the included studies was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Results: A total of 15 studies published between 2015 and 2023 involving 899 participants aged approximately between 19 and 84 years, 60.7% (546/899) of whom were female participants, were included in this review. The interventions lasted between 2 and 26 weeks in the included studies. Recommender systems were the most commonly used AI technology in digital solutions for PA (10/15 studies), followed by conversational agents (4/15 studies). User acceptability and satisfaction were the HFs most frequently evaluated (5/15 studies each), followed by usability (4/15 studies). Regarding automated data collection for personalization and recommendation, most systems involved fitness trackers (5/15 studies). The certainty of the evidence analysis indicates moderate certainty of the effectiveness of AI -driven digital technologies in increasing PA (eg, number of steps, distance walked, or time spent on PA). Furthermore, AI -driven technology, particularly recommender systems, seems to positively influence changes in PA behavior, although with very low certainty evidence. Conclusions: Current research highlights the potential of AI -driven technologies to enhance PA, though the evidence remains limited. Longer -term studies are necessary to assess the sustained impact of AI -driven technologies on behavior change and habit formation. While AI -driven digital solutions for PA hold significant promise, further exploration into optimizing AI's impact on PA and effectively integrating AI and HFs is crucial for broader benefits. Thus, the implications for innovation management involve conducting long-term studies, prioritizing diversity, ensuring research quality, focusing on user experience, and understanding the evolving role of AI in PA promotion.

TI  - A scoping review of patient-facing, behavioral health interventions with voice assistant technology targeting self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Engaging in positive healthy lifestyle behaviors continues to be a public health challenge, requiring innovative solutions. As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence Chatbot Behavior Change Model for Designing Artificial Intelligence Chatbots to Promote Physical Activity and a Healthy Diet: Viewpoint
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet.
   Objective: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations.
   Methods: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model.
   Results: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper.
   Conclusions: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles.

TI  - The Effects of Expressing Empathy/Autonomy Support Using a COVID-19 Vaccination Chatbot: Experimental Study in a Sample of Belgian Adults
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Chatbots are increasingly used to support COVID-19 vaccination programs. Their persuasiveness may depend on the conversation-related context.Objective: This study aims to investigate the moderating role of the conversation quality and chatbot expertise cues in the effects of expressing empathy/autonomy support using COVID-19 vaccination chatbots.Methods: This experiment with 196 Dutch-speaking adults living in Belgium, who engaged in a conversation with a chatbot providing vaccination information, used a 2 (empathy/autonomy support expression: present vs absent) x 2 (chatbot expertise cues: expert endorser vs layperson endorser) between-subject design. Chatbot conversation quality was assessed through actual conversation logs. Perceived user autonomy (PUA), chatbot patronage intention (CPI), and vaccination intention shift (VIS) were measured after the conversation, coded from 1 to 5 (PUA, CPI) and from -5 to 5 (VIS). Results: There was a negative interaction effect of chatbot empathy/autonomy support expression and conversation fallback (CF; the percentage of chatbot answers "I do not understand" in a conversation) on PUA (PROCESS macro, model 1, B=-3.358, SE 1.235, t186=2.718, P=.007). Specifically, empathy/autonomy support expression had a more negative effect on PUA when the CF was higher (conditional effect of empathy/autonomy support expression at the CF level of +1SD: B=-.405, SE 0.158, t186=2.564, P=.011; conditional effects nonsignificant for the mean level: B=-0.103, SE 0.113, t186=0.914, P=.36; conditional effects nonsignificant for the -1SD level: B=0.031, SE=0.123, t186=0.252, P=.80). Moreover, an indirect effect of empathy/autonomy support expression on CPI via PUA was more negative when CF was higher (PROCESS macro, model 7, 5000 bootstrap samples, moderated mediation index=-3.676, BootSE 1.614, 95% CI -6.697 to -0.102; conditional indirect effect at the CF level of +1SD: B=-0.443, BootSE 0.202, 95% CI -0.809 to -0.005; conditional indirect effects nonsignificant for the mean level: B=-0.113, BootSE 0.124, 95% CI -0.346 to 0.137; conditional indirect effects nonsignificant for the -1SD level: B=0.034, BootSE 0.132, 95% CI -0.224 to 0.305). Indirect effects of empathy/autonomy support expression on VIS via PUA were marginally more negative when CF was higher. No effects of chatbot expertise cues were found. Conclusions: The findings suggest that expressing empathy/autonomy support using a chatbot may harm its evaluation and persuasiveness when the chatbot fails to answer its users' questions. The paper adds to the literature on vaccination chatbots by exploring the conditional effects of chatbot empathy/autonomy support expression. The results will guide policy makers and chatbot developers dealing with vaccination promotion in designing the way chatbots express their empathy and support for user autonomy.

TI  - A Motivational Interviewing Chatbot With Generative Reflections for Increasing Readiness to Quit Smoking: Iterative Development Study
T2  - JMIR MENTAL HEALTH
AB  - Background: The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client's statements, using a generative language model. Objective: This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections.Methods: Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants' readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tunedResults: The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations.Conclusions: The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions.

TI  - Leveraging human-centered design and causal pathway diagramming toward enhanced specification and development of innovative implementation strategies: a case example of an outreach tool to address racial inequities in breast cancer screening
T2  - IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Background Implementation strategies are strategies to improve uptake of evidence-based practices or interventions and are essential to implementation science. Developing or tailoring implementation strategies may benefit from integrating approaches from other disciplines; yet current guidance on how to effectively incorporate methods from other disciplines to develop and refine innovative implementation strategies is limited. We describe an approach that combines community-engaged methods, human-centered design (HCD) methods, and causal pathway diagramming (CPD)-an implementation science tool to map an implementation strategy as it is intended to work-to develop innovative implementation strategies.
   Methods We use a case example of developing a conversational agent or chatbot to address racial inequities in breast cancer screening via mammography. With an interdisciplinary team including community members and operational leaders, we conducted a rapid evidence review and elicited qualitative data through interviews and focus groups using HCD methods to identify and prioritize key determinants (facilitators and barriers) of the evidence-based intervention (breast cancer screening) and the implementation strategy (chatbot). We developed a CPD using key determinants and proposed strategy mechanisms and proximal outcomes based in conceptual frameworks.
   Results We identified key determinants for breast cancer screening and for the chatbot implementation strategy. Mistrust was a key barrier to both completing breast cancer screening and using the chatbot. We focused design for the initial chatbot interaction to engender trust and developed a CPD to guide chatbot development. We used the persuasive health message framework and conceptual frameworks about trust from marketing and artificial intelligence disciplines. We developed a CPD for the initial interaction with the chatbot with engagement as a mechanism to use and trust as a proximal outcome leading to further engagement with the chatbot.
   Conclusions The use of interdisciplinary methods is core to implementation science. HCD is a particularly synergistic discipline with multiple existing applications of HCD to implementation research. We present an extension of this work and an example of the potential value in an integrated community-engaged approach of HCD and implementation science researchers and methods to combine strengths of both disciplines and develop human-centered implementation strategies rooted in causal perspective and healthcare equity.

TI  - A Technology-Enhanced Intervention for Violence and Substance Use Prevention Among Young Black Men: Protocol for Adaptation and Pilot Testing
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Black boys and men from disinvested communities are disproportionately survivors and perpetrators of youth violence. Those presenting to emergency departments with firearm-related injuries also report recent substance use. However, young Black men face several critical individual and systemic barriers to accessing trauma-focused prevention programs. These barriers contribute to service avoidance, the exacerbation of violence recidivism, substance use relapse, and a revolving-door approach to prevention. In addition, young Black men are known to be digital natives. Therefore, technology-enhanced interventions offer a pragmatic and promising opportunity to mitigate these barriers, provide vital life skills for self-led behavior change, and boost service engagement with vital community resources.Objective: The study aims to systematically adapt and pilot-test Boosting Violence-Related Outcomes Using Technology for Empowerment, Risk Reduction, and Life Skills Preparation in Youth Based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (BrotherlyACT), a culturally congruent, trauma-focused digital psychoeducational and service-engagement tool tailored to young Black men aged 15-24 years. BrotherlyACT will incorporate microlearning modules, interactive safety planning tools for risk assessment, goal-setting, mindfulness practice, and a service-engagement conversational agent or chatbot to connect young Black men to relevant services.Methods: The development of BrotherlyACT will occur in 3 phases. In phase 1, we will qualitatively investigate barriers and facilitators influencing young Black men's willingness to use violence and substance use prevention services with 15-30 young Black men (aged 15-24 years) who report perpetrating violence and substance use in the past year and 10 service providers (aged >18 years; any gender; including health care providers, street outreach workers, social workers, violence interrupters, community advocates, and school staff). Both groups will be recruited from community and pediatric emergency settings. In phase 2, a steering group of topic experts (n=3-5) and a youth and community advisory board comprising young Black men (n=8-12) and service providers (n=5-10) will be involved in participatory design, alpha testing, and beta testing sessions to develop, refine, and adapt BrotherlyACT based on an existing skills-based program (Achieving Change Through Values-Based Behavior). We will use user-centered design principles and the Assessment, Decision, Administration, Production, Topical, Experts, Integration, Training, and Testing framework to guide this adaptation process (phase 2). In phase 3, a total of 60 young Black men will pilot-test the adapted BrotherlyACT over 10 weeks in a single-group, pretest-posttest design to determine its feasibility and implementation outcomes.Results: Phase 1 data collection began in September 2021. Phases 2 and 3 are scheduled to start in June 2023 and end in September 2024.Conclusions: The development and testing of BrotherlyACT is a crucial first step in expanding an evidence-based psychoeducational and service-mediating intervention for young Black men involved in violence. This colocation of services shifts the current prevention strategy from telling them why to change to teaching them how.

TI  - Digital Home-Based Self-Monitoring System for People with Heart Failure: Protocol for Development of SmartHeart and Evaluation of Feasibility and Acceptability
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic, progressive condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. In addition to the daily challenges that HF poses, acute exacerbations can lead to costly hospitalizations and increased mortality. High health care costs and the burden of HF have led to the emerging application of new technologies to support people living with HF to stay well while living in the community. However, many digital solutions have not involved consumers and health care professionals in their design, leading to poor adoption. The SmartHeart project aimed to codevelop a smart health ecosystem to support the early detection of HF deterioration and encourage self-care, potentially preventing hospitalizations. Objective: This study aims to provide an overview of the SmartHeart project by describing our approach to designing the SmartHeart system, outlining its features, and describing the planned pilot study to determine the feasibility of the system. Methods: We used the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework to guide the development of the SmartHeart system, involving users (people with HF and their caregivers) and stakeholders (health care providers involved in the management of HF) in its design. SmartHeart is a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system. It includes 2 user interfaces for patients: an Amazon Alexa conversational agent and a smartphone app. The system collects physiological, symptom, and behavioral data through wireless sensors and self-reports from users. These data are processed and analyzed to provide personalized health insights, self-care support, and alerts in case of health deterioration. The system also includes a web-based user interface for health care professionals, allowing them to access data, send messages to users, and receive notifications about potential health deterioration. A single-arm, multicenter pilot trial (N=20) is planned to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SmartHeart before evaluation through a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome will be a description of the study's feasibility (recruitment, attrition, engagement, and changes in self-care). Results: The SmartHeart study started in January 2021 on procurement of funding. Recruitment for the pilot trial started in August 2024 and will be completed by March 2025. We have currently enrolled 12 participants. Follow-up of all participants will be completed by the end of May 2025. Conclusions: We have co-designed and developed a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system for the early detection of HF deterioration and prevention of HF-related hospitalizations. The next step is a pilot study, which will provide valuable information on feasibility and preliminary effects to inform a larger evaluation trial. SmartHeart has the potential to augment existing health services and help people with HF stay well while living in the community.

TI  - Feasibility and Acceptability of Chatbots for Nutrition and Physical Activity Health Promotion Among Adolescents: Systematic Scoping Review With Adolescent Consultation
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Reducing lifestyle risk behaviors among adolescents depends on access to age-appropriate health promotion information. Chatbots-computer programs designed to simulate conversations with human users-have the potential to deliver health information to adolescents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and support behavior change, but research on the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in the adolescent population is unknown. Objective: This systematic scoping review aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions among adolescents. A secondary aim is to consult adolescents to identify features of chatbots that are acceptable and feasible. Methods: We searched 6 electronic databases from March to April 2022 (MEDLINE, Embase, Joanna Briggs Institute, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Association for Computing Machinery library, and the IT database Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Peer-reviewed studies were included that were conducted in the adolescent population (10-19 years old) without any chronic disease, except obesity or type 2 diabetes, and assessed chatbots used nutrition or physical activity interventions or both that encouraged individuals to meet dietary or physical activity guidelines and support positive behavior change. Studies were screened by 2 independent reviewers, with any queries resolved by a third reviewer. Data were extracted into tables and collated in a narrative summary. Gray literature searches were also undertaken. Results of the scoping review were presented to a diverse youth advisory group (N=16, 13-18 years old) to gain insights into this topic beyond what is published in the literature. Results: The search identified 5558 papers, with 5 (0.1%) studies describing 5 chatbots meeting the inclusion criteria. The 5 chatbots were supported by mobile apps using a combination of the following features: personalized feedback, conversational agents, gamification, and monitoring of behavior change. Of the 5 studies, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on nutrition, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on physical activity, and 1 (20.0%) focused on both nutrition and physical activity. Feasibility and acceptability varied across the 5 studies, with usage rates above 50% in 3 (60.0%) studies. In addition, 3 (60.0%) studies reported health-related outcomes, with only 1 (20.0%) study showing promising effects of the intervention. Adolescents presented novel concerns around the use of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions, including ethical concerns and the use of false or misleading Conclusions: Limited research is available on chatbots in adolescent nutrition and physical activity interventions, finding identified issues in the design features that have not been mentioned in the published literature. Therefore, chatbot codesign with adolescents may help ensure that such technology is feasible and acceptable to an adolescent population.

TI  - Generative AI and the future of marketing: A consumer protection perspective
T2  - COMPUTER LAW & SECURITY REVIEW
AB  - Generative AI has the potential to be the biggest disruption in marketing since the emergence of digital commerce in the early 2000s. This article will focus on three ways in which generative AI is expected to change marketing. First, generative AI enables companies to automatically create advertising copy and images, potentially leading to significant cost reductions. Secondly, generative AI offers possibilities to improve and automate personalised marketing, potentially enabling companies to send the right persuasive message at the right time to each potential customer. Thirdly, generative AI potentially offers possibilities to market products to consumers via generative AI chatbots. These developments offer potential advantages but also bear risks for consumers. For example, deepfakes in advertising can mislead consumers, AI-generated personalised marketing can exploit consumer vulnerabilities, and B2C chatbots can deceive consumers by providing biased advice. This article shows that EU law does in principle provide protection to consumers in relation to AI-generated marketing, but is also likely to fall short in effectively protecting consumers against the identified risks in several ways.

TI  - AI-powered ChatGPT in the hospitality and tourism industry: benefits, challenges, theoretical framework, propositions and future research directions
T2  - TOURISM RECREATION RESEARCH
AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and smart/e-tourism provide imperative opportunities to service industries; however, the implementation of ChatGPT in the tourism and hospitality industry is limited, which extends different considerations/challenges that need vigilant reflection. Based on this significance and research gap, we thus develop a theoretical framework which suggests different sets of key research propositions in AI technology-powered ChatGPT. A widespread literature review and practices were conducted to investigate the conceptual advancements/developments on generative AI-powered technologies including ChatGPT, chatbot in marketing, tourism, hospitality and information management. The proposed framework suggests generative AI technology-powered ChatGPT develops customer's interaction-based conditions including experience, engagement/trust, attachment, satisfaction/service quality, attitude change and operational efficiency, which consequently affect their strategic outcomes including behaviours, subjective/psychological well-being, happiness and performance. Thus, this research note suggests theoretical/practical implications to provide an extensive future-research roadmap on AI technology-powered ChatGPT and also recommends transformative opportunities, challenges and benefits in tourism, hospitality and marketing management.

TI  - Leveraging Generative AI Tools to Support the Development of Digital Solutions in Health Care Research: Case Study
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize health technology product development by improving coding quality, efficiency, documentation, quality assessment and review, and troubleshooting. Objective: This paper explores the application of a commercially available generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) to the development of a digital health behavior change intervention designed to support patient engagement in a commercial digital diabetes prevention program. Methods: We examined the capacity, advantages, and limitations of ChatGPT to support digital product idea conceptualization, intervention content development, and the software engineering process, including software requirement generation, software design, and code production. In total, 11 evaluators, each with at least 10 years of experience in fields of study ranging from medicine and implementation science to computer science, participated in the output review process (ChatGPT vs human -generated output). All had familiarity or prior exposure to the original personalized automatic messaging system intervention. The evaluators rated the ChatGPT-produced outputs in terms of understandability, usability, novelty, relevance, completeness, and efficiency. Results: Most metrics received positive scores. We identified that ChatGPT can (1) support developers to achieve high -quality products faster and (2) facilitate nontechnical communication and system understanding between technical and nontechnical team members around the development goal of rapid and easy -to -build computational solutions for medical technologies. Conclusions: ChatGPT can serve as a usable facilitator for researchers engaging in the software development life cycle, from product conceptualization to feature identification and user story development to code generation.

TI  - Persuasive Surfaces and Calculating Machines. A Rhetorical Perspective on Artificial Intelligence
T2  - GLOBAL PHILOSOPHY
AB  - This essay examines the communicative implications of generative AI through a rhetorical lens. Rather than asking whether machines can truly 'think,' this approach considers how generative AI's probabilistic outputs construct persuasive textual 'surfaces' that interact rhetorically with human communication. Authorship and meaning are no longer localized to a single individual creator but emerge through the interplay of human and machine co-construction of 'possible worlds.' By viewing generative AI as a 'techn & eacute;' in the classical sense, we examine how models 'imitate' prior texts through algorithmic recombination. As AI accelerates information flows, it becomes increasingly important for individuals to develop rhetorical literacy, to deconstruct the interests and values encoded in AI's persuasive surfaces. In contrast to the influential but one-directional information-theoretical communication model proposed by Shannon (1948), the essay advocates a rhetorical model of communication that emphasizes the active role of readers in reconstructing possible worlds from textual offers. Rather than neutral vessels of truth, generative AI outputs are inherently contingent yet interest-driven, requiring enhanced communicative competencies to navigate their impacts on changing concepts of reality, authorship, and common ground.

TI  - Technological optimism surpasses fear of missing out: A multigroup analysis of presumed media influence on generative AI technology adoption across varying levels of technological optimism
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - Drawing upon the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) model, this study investigates indirect media effects on individuals' intentions to adopt generative AI technology, with a further examination of how variations in technological optimism impact the relationships within the IPMI model. Findings from a national survey of 1061 respondents confirmed the existence of presumed media influence in the context of generative AI technology, as individuals' attention to generative AI technology related media content influenced their presumptions about how others use it, subsequently affecting their adoption intentions through social norm perception, attitude change, and the fear of missing out. Furthermore, a multigroup comparison uncovers divergent presumed media effects on generative AI technology adoption between subgroups characterized by their differing levels of technological optimism, in which high technological optimism was found to trump fear of missing out in driving its adoption.

T2  - 2023 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DATA, INFORMATION AND COMPUTING SCIENCE, CDICS
CP  - 2023 International Conference on Data, Information and Computing Science
AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a spectrum of generative AI services that promise to enhance various professional and personal tasks. This study aims to explore the factors influencing users intentions to transition from basic to premium generative AI services, focusing on Performance Expectancy (PE), Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), Personal Innovativeness (PI), and Social Influence (SI). A survey of 193 individuals, primarily university students with an IT background, revealed that PE, TSE, and SI significantly affect the Behavioral Intention (BI) to adopt enhanced services, with SI being the most influential. Contrary to expectations, PI did not predict BI, indicating that innovation alone does not drive the adoption of advanced AI capabilities. The findings suggest that the practicality of AI tools, user confidence in their technical skills, and the persuasive power of social networks are pivotal in the decision-making process for upgrading AI services. This research contributes to the understanding of AI adoption patterns and provides insights for developers and marketers to tailor user experiences and educational initiatives that align with user needs and social dynamics. It also underscores the importance of addressing ethical considerations as AI continues to permeate various aspects of society.

TI  - Tracing the legitimacy of Artificial Intelligence: A longitudinal analysis of media discourse
T2  - TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most relevant technologies of our time. During the last decade, AI has made major technological breakthroughs most recently in the space of generative AI. This development is enabled by an increase in computing power, a decrease in its price, and the emergence of ubiquitous computing, resulting in vast amounts of storable and processable data. However, the diffusion of AI depends on its legitimacy in society, whereby legitimacy is understood as the congruence between organizational activities and their cultural environment. This study aims at understanding the process whereby AI is being (de)legitimated across key industries and over time. To capture and trace the process of legitimation, we rely on media coverage as a form of societal discourse reflecting the legitimation process of AI. We find that the legitimation process gathers momentum in the mid-2010s and the legitimacy of AI increases over time. Furthermore, we identify four types of legitimacy discourse, which integrate sentiment, specific media frames, and appeals of persuasion. Uncovering the four types of legitimacy discourse, we aim at supporting organizations seeking to understand the legitimacy of specific AI applications and how these legitimacy judgments can shift.

TI  - Identifying Behavior Change Techniques in an Artificial Intelligence-Based Fitness App: A Content Analysis
T2  - HEALTH EDUCATION & BEHAVIOR
AB  - In the field of artificial intelligence-based fitness apps, the effective integration of behavior change techniques (BCTs) is critical for promoting physical activity and improving health outcomes. However, the specific BCTs employed by apps and their impact on user engagement and behavior change are not explored sufficiently. This study investigates the Freeletics fitness app through a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the use of BCTs. In the quantitative analysis, fifteen unique BCTs were identified based on the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy (V1). In the qualitative analysis, user reviews (n=400) were examined to understand perspectives on the app's effectiveness in promoting behavior change. Goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring of behavior, and social support were among the most prevalent BCTs identified in the Freeletics app, and their effectiveness in enhancing user engagement and promoting behavior change was also highlighted by user reviews. Among the areas of improvement identified in the study were the need for simplifying personalization options and addressing user concerns regarding the specificity of feedback. The study underscores the importance of integrating BCTs effectively within AI-based fitness apps to drive user engagement and facilitate behavior change. It contributes valuable insights into the design and implementation of BCTs in fitness apps and offers recommendations for developers, emphasizing the significance of goal setting, feedback mechanisms, self-monitoring, and social support. By understanding the impact of specific BCTs on user behavior and addressing user concerns, developers can create more effective fitness apps, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyles and positive behavior change.

TI  - How real is real enough? Unveiling the diverse power of generative AI-enabled virtual influencers and the dynamics of human responses
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB  - Virtual influencers in various forms are capturing a growing share of ad spend from human influencers. Followers respond to virtual influencers much as if they were human, with engagement rates and measures of trust and source credibility that rival their human counterparts. However, there is an acute need for more nuanced understanding of the differential characteristics of user engagement with human influencers and the many emerging forms, types and interactional characteristics of virtual influencers. We conduct an exploratory study of three parts. First, through an indepth review of the existing literature, we delineate the implications of unsettled taxonomies of virtual influencers by function and form, and we outline a revised typology. Second, our secondary review of virtual influencer literature, trade, and industry sources conceptualizes divergent factors influencing the persuasive capability of human and virtual influencers while identifying intersecting research themes. From this synthesis we induce suggestions for future research and practice. Finally, we assess, refine and adjust our framework through depth interviews with leading expert practitioners to generate six key findings to guide future researched-backed virtual influencer practice and research.

TI  - Supporting Adolescent Engagement with Artificial Intelligence-Driven Digital Health Behavior Change Interventions
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Understanding and optimizing adolescent-specific engagement with behavior change interventions will open doors for providers to promote healthy changes in an age group that is simultaneously difficult to engage and especially important to affect. For digital interventions, there is untapped potential in combining the vastness of process-level data with the analytical power of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand not only how adolescents engage but also how to improve upon interventions with the goal of increasing engagement and, ultimately, efficacy. Rooted in the example of the INSPIRE narrative-centered digital health behavior change intervention (DHBCI) for adolescent risky behaviors around alcohol use, we propose a framework for harnessing AI to accomplish 4 goals that are pertinent to health care providers and software developers alike: measurement of adolescent engagement, modeling of adolescent engagement, optimization of current interventions, and generation of novel interventions. Operationalization of this framework with youths must be situated in the ethical use of this technology, and we have outlined the potential pitfalls of AI with particular attention to privacy concerns for adolescents. Given how recently AI advances have opened up these possibilities in this field, the opportunities for further investigation are plenty.

TI  - A longitudinal study on artificial intelligence adoption: understanding the drivers of ChatGPT usage behavior change in higher education
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to progress, the use of AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in higher education settings has gained significant attention. This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students' ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students' ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students' ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students' ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education. The findings also provide actionable guidance for AI developers and educational institutions seeking to optimize student engagement with AI technologies.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence-Based Chatbots for Promoting Health Behavioral Changes: Systematic Review
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots can offer personalized, engaging, and on-demand health promotion interventions. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior change. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated the feasibility or efficacy of AI chatbots for behavior change. The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles were performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6, 40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1, 7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and expert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of the moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI techniques, and limitation for generalizability. Conclusions: AI chatbots have demonstrated the efficacy of health behavior change interventions among large and diverse populations; however, future studies need to adopt robust randomized control trials to establish definitive conclusions.

TI  - How AI sources can increase openness to opposing views
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB  - Exposure to counterattitudinal information has been shown to yield mixed effects on attitude polarization. The current research explores the differential impact of such information when generated by artificial intelligence (AI) versus human sources. While prior work highlights a general aversion to AI for decision-making, our research reveals a consistent openness to AI in the context of counterattitudinal messages. Across four pre-registered studies (N = 2061), we find that when people receive counterattitudinal messages on potentially polarizing issues, AI sources are perceived as less biased, more informative, and having less persuasive intent than human sources. This leads to greater receptiveness to counterattitudinal messages when those messages come from AI rather than human sources. In addition, we find preliminary evidence that receiving counterattitudinal messages from an AI (versus human) source can diminish outgroup animosity and facilitate attitude change.

AB  - The potential of LLMs to generate context-specific content for psychiatric patients could possibly be used to support treatment. Patients diagnosed with Severe Mental Illnesses face a significant challenge in the realm of goal setting. Caregivers work closely with patients with SMI to establish treatment goals. However, most goals are often immeasurable, hindering their integration into mHealth. This is a missed opportunity since mHealth has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in tracking a patient's progress and help motivate patients to work on their goals using behavior change concepts like personalization and gamification. Recognizing the time-consuming nature of creating measurable goals. This study validates an LLM-powered goal system aiming to provide a time-efficient way of goal creation for patients with SMI, on the quality of the goals it generates in collaboration with caregivers.

AB  - Traditionally, AI has been modeled within economics as a technology that impacts payoffs by reducing costs or refining information for human agents. Our position is that, in light of recent advances in generative AI, it is increasingly useful to model AI itself as an economic agent. In our framework, each user is augmented with an AI agent and can consult the AI prior to taking actions in a game. The AI agent and the user have potentially different information and preferences over the communication, which can result in equilibria that are qualitatively different than in settings without AI.

TI  - From Destination to Daily Life: A Longitudinal Study on the Effects of Flashback Nudging on Pro-environmental Behavior Spillover
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB  - This study examines how flashback nudging-a reminder of past pro-environmental actions-delivered through a chatbot survey over 6 weeks in a quasi-experimental design, can facilitate pro-environmental behavior spillover among tourists visiting nature-based destinations. Integrating conversational artificial intelligence allows for personalized, timely, and scalable interventions, making the delivery of flashback nudges more efficient and engaging than traditional methods. Flashback nudging effectively strengthens the impact of environmental self-identity on behavioral change. Although nudges take time to work, the multigroup analysis revealed significant differences in self-reported past pro-environmental behaviors between the treatment and control groups. The findings demonstrate the importance of deliberate, technology-enabled interventions in enhancing meaning-making processes and promoting transformative tourism experiences. Artificial intelligence advances behavior change efforts by enabling innovative, lasting environmental engagement. This study emphasizes the potential of conversational artificial intelligence to drive tourism's contributions to a sustainable future, advancing the discourse on leveraging technology for behavioral interventions in tourism.

TI  - Responsible design of an AI system for health behavior change-an ethics perspective on the participatory design process of the STAR-C digital coach
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Introduction The increased focus on the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) follows the increased use in society of data-driven analyses of personal information collected in the use of digital applications for various purposes that the individual is often not aware of. The purpose of this study is to investigate how values and norms are transformed into design choices in a participatory design process of an AI-based digital coaching application for promoting health and to prevent cardiovascular diseases, where a variety of expertise and perspectives are represented.Method A participatory design process was conducted engaging domain professionals and potential users in co-design workshops, interviews and observations of prototype use. The design process and outcome was analyzed from a responsible design of AI systems perspective.Results The results include deepened understanding of the values and norms underlying health coaching applications and how an AI-based intervention could provide person-tailored support in managing conflicting norms. Further, the study contributes to increased awareness of the value of participatory design in achieving value-based design of AI systems aimed at promoting health through behavior change, and the inclusion of social norms as a design material in the process.Conclusion It was concluded that the relationship between the anticipated future users and the organization(s) or enterprises developing and implementing the health-promoting application is directing which values are manifested in the application.

TI  - Systematic review of context-aware digital behavior change interventions to improve health
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Health risk behaviors are leading contributors to morbidity, premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, and escalating health costs. However, traditional interventions to change health behaviors often have modest effects, and limited applicability and scale. To better support health improvement goals across the care continuum, new approaches incorporating various smart technologies are being utilized to create more individualized digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). The purpose of this study is to identify context-aware DBCIs that provide individualized interventions to improve health. A systematic review of published literature (2013-2020) was conducted from multiple databases and manual searches. All included DBCIs were context-aware, automated digital health technologies, whereby user input, activity, or location influenced the intervention. Included studies addressed explicit health behaviors and reported data of behavior change outcomes. Data extracted from studies included study design, type of intervention, including its functions and technologies used, behavior change techniques, and target health behavior and outcomes data. Thirty-three articles were included, comprising mobile health (mHealth) applications, Internet of Things wearables/sensors, and internet-based web applications. The most frequently adopted behavior change techniques were in the groupings of feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning. Technologies used to apply these in a context-aware, automated fashion included analytic and artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning and symbolic reasoning) methods requiring various degrees of access to data. Studies demonstrated improvements in physical activity, dietary behaviors, medication adherence, and sun protection practices. Context-aware DBCIs effectively supported behavior change to improve users' health behaviors.

TI  - Explainable AI: The Effect of Contradictory Decisions and Explanations on Users' Acceptance of AI Systems
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - Providing explanations of an artificial intelligence (AI) system has been suggested as a means to increase users' acceptance during the decision-making process. However, little research has been done to examine the psychological mechanism of how these explanations cause a positive or negative reaction in the user. To address this gap, we investigate the effect on user acceptance if decisions and the associated provided explanations contradict between an AI system and the user. An interdisciplinary research model was derived and validated by an experiment with 78 participants. Findings suggest that in decision situations with cognitive misfit users experience negative mood significantly more often and have a negative evaluation of the AI system's support. Therefore, the following article provides further guidance regarding new interdisciplinary approaches for dealing with human-AI interaction during the decision-making process and sheds some light on how explainable AI can increase users' acceptance of such systems.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON THE IMPACT OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS (ECIAIR 2021)
CP  - 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (ECIAIR)
AB  - Affective Computing refers to a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims to recognize, interpret, and adequately respond to human emotions. Human-machine interactions should thus become more individual and emotionally appealing. But what would our everyday life look like if such an emotionally intelligent artificial being became our best friend? This question was addressed by a multilinear development scenario that lets the reader experience different stages in the life of the protagonist from the first day in secondary school to the loss of a loved one in midlife. The subject of this sci-fi prototyping was the progressive power of emotional artificial intelligence, which becomes tangible in this multilinear story in four fictional stages in the future. In each stage, the reader is presented with a decision that affects the role of the artificially intelligent being in the protagonist's life. In this way, different versions of our digital future can be experienced with affective computing.

T2  - PHEALTH 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WEARABLE MICRO AND NANO TECHNOLOGIES FOR PERSONALIZED HEALTH
CP  - 17th International Conference on Wearable Micro and Nano Technologies for Personalized Health (pHealth)
AB  - A broad range of aspects are needed to be taken into consideration in the design and development of personalized coaching systems based on artificial intelligence methodologies. This research presents the initial phase of joining different professional and stakeholder perspectives on behavior change technologies into a flexible design proposal for a digital coaching system. The diversity and sometimes opposed views on content, behavior, purposes and context were managed using a structured argument-based design approach, which also feed into the behavior of the personalized system. Results include a set of personalization strategies that will be further elaborated with the target user group to manage sensitive issues such as ethics, social norms, privacy, motivation, autonomy and social relatedness.

TI  - Exploring Designer Trust in Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content: TAM/TPB Model Study
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Traditionally, users have perceived that only manual laborers or those in repetitive jobs would be subject to technological substitution. However, with the emergence of technologies like Midjourney, ChatGPT, and Notion AI, known as Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), we have come to realize that cognitive laborers, particularly creative designers, also face similar professional challenges. Yet, there has been relatively little research analyzing the acceptance and trust of artificial intelligence from the perspective of designers. This study integrates the TAM/TPB behavioral measurement model, incorporating intrinsic characteristics of designers, to delineate their perceived risks of AIGC into functional and emotional dimensions. It explores how these perceived characteristics, risks, and trust influence designers' behavioral intentions, employing structural equation modeling for validation. The findings reveal the following: (1) designer trust is the primary factor influencing their behavioral choices; (2) different dimensions of perceived risks have varying degrees of impact on trust, with functional risks significantly positively affecting trust compared to emotional risks; (3) only by enhancing the transparency and credibility of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) can the perceived characteristics of designers be elevated; and (4) only by effectively safeguarding designers' legitimate rights and interests can perceived risks be significantly reduced, thereby enhancing trust and subsequently prompting actual behavioral intentions. This study not only enhances the applicability and suitability of AIGC across various industries but also provides evidence for the feasibility of intelligent design in the creative design industry, facilitating the transition of AIGC to Artificial Intelligence-Generated Design (AIGD) for industrial upgrading.

TI  - A Framework for Implementing Disease Prevention and Behavior Change Evidence at Scale
T2  - ROLE OF DIGITAL HEALTH POLICY AND LEADERSHIP
CP  - Future of Health Leadership, Informatics and Policy conference
AB  - The current corpus of evidence-based information for chronic disease prevention and treatment is vast and growing rapidly. Behavior change theories are increasingly more powerful but difficult to operationalize in the current healthcare system. Millions of Canadians are unable to access personalized preventive and behavior change care because our in-person model of care is running at full capacity and is not set up for mass education and behavior change programs. We propose a framework to utilize data from electronic medical records to identify patients at risk of developing chronic disease and reach out to them using digital health tools that are overseen by the primary care team. The framework leverages emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital health tools, and patient-generated data to deliver evidence-based knowledge and behavior change to patients across Canada at scale. The framework is flexible to enable new technologies to be added without overwhelming providers, patients or implementers.

TI  - Motivational interviewing skills practice enhanced with artificial intelligence: ReadMI
T2  - BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundFinding time in the medical curriculum to focus on motivational interviewing (MI) training is a challenge in many medical schools. We developed a software-based training tool, "Real-time Assessment of Dialogue in Motivational Interviewing" (ReadMI), that aims to advance the skill acquisition of medical students as they learn the MI approach. This human-artificial intelligence teaming may help reduce the cognitive load on a training facilitator.MethodsDuring their Family Medicine clerkship, 125 third-year medical students were scheduled in pairs to participate in a 90-minute MI training session, with each student doing two role-plays as the physician. Intervention group students received both facilitator feedback and ReadMI metrics after their first role-play, while control group students received only facilitator feedback.ResultsWhile students in both conditions improved their MI approach from the first to the second role-play, those in the intervention condition used significantly more open-ended questions, fewer closed-ended questions, and had a higher ratio of open to closed questions.ConclusionMI skills practice can be gained with a relatively small investment of student time, and artificial intelligence can be utilized both for the measurement of MI skill acquisition and as an instructional aid.

TI  - Physics instructors' acceptance and implementation of generative AI
T2  - PHYSICAL REVIEW PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH
AB  - [This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Artificial Intelligence Tools in Physics Teaching and Physics Education Research.] This study investigates physics instructors' acceptance and implementation of generative AI (GenAI) in physics education, guided by Rogers' diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, focusing on its five-stage innovation-decision process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Two survey versions were developed-one for GenAI users and another for nonusers. Data were collected through an online survey featuring five-point Likert scale items and open-ended questions, yielding 320 responses from high school and university physics instructors. The persuasion stage was explored in depth using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). A mixed-method approach combining quantitative structural equation modeling (SEM) and qualitative content analysis was employed. We found instructors distributed across different adoption stages, with key barriers including insufficient technical knowledge (51.75% of nonusers) and language processing limitations (50.5% of users). Hedonic motivation (/3 = 0.498) was found to have a substantially stronger influence on adoption than performance expectancy (/3 = 0.121), with an effect size approximately 4 times greater. We identified significant differences between paid and free GenAI users, with paid users more likely to request prompt-writing guidance (30.56% vs 6.47%) despite using more advanced models. Support needs also varied substantially, as half of paid users requested budget support for GenAI services compared to only 17.65% of free users. Most physics instructors used GenAI primarily for assessment tasks, particularly for generatingphysics problems with solutions. Their primary concerns included incorrect physics information in GenAI responses, potential negative impacts on students' analytical thinking, language barriers, and challenges with prompt writing. These findings suggest that successful GenAI integration in physics education requires physics-specific training and differentiated support based on whether instructors use free or paid versions of GenAI tools.

TI  - Deception detection in educational AI: challenges for Japanese middle school students in interacting with generative AI robots
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Educational materials that utilize generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) have been developed, thus, allowing students to learn through conversations with robots or agents. However, if these artificial entities provide incorrect information (hallucinating), it could lead to confusion among students. To investigate whether students can detect lies from these artificial entities, we conducted an experiment using the social robot Furhat and we make it engage in various types of deceptive interactions. Twenty-two Japanese middle school students participated in ten teaching sessions with Furhat using a human and an anime facial appearances while employing different types of deception: Lying, Paltering, Pandering, and Bullshit. The results revealed that the majority of students were deceived by those lies. Additionally, the robot's facial appearance (i.e., social agency) affected both the learning effectiveness and the likelihood of being deceived. We conclude that an anime robot face is recommended to be used as it excelled in learning effectiveness as it attracts students attention. An anime face also provided protection against deceptive techniques due to its low social agency which leads to ineffectiveness in persuasion and deception. This study underscores the importance of preparing AI-based educational tools and scripts carefully to prevent the dissemination of false information produced through generative AI hallucinations to students.

TI  - How the decision to accept or reject PV affects the behaviour of residential battery system adopters
T2  - APPLIED ENERGY
AB  - When residential rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely accepted across society, the uptake of home battery energy storage systems is closely tied to the PV-status quo and the behaviour previously taken by households. This study proposes that a decision of acceptance or rejection of PV systems is the past behaviour of the battery adoption decision. This antecedent role of PV behaviour may spark two attitudinal changes: (a) feelings of regret, which may occur among PV adopters, stemming from a positive experience of using the system, or among non-adopters due to their rejection of the system, and (b) feelings of despair, which may arise among current PV users due to dissatisfaction and discontent with the system. While regret positively changes consumers' attitude towards battery adoption expediting an earlier purchase, despair could preclude battery installation. Through a survey of 557 households in South East Queensland, Australia, this study investigated factors driving attitude change. Instead of traditional statistical methods, machine learning algorithms were adopted to derive data-driven models of attitude change, allowing for higher prediction accuracy and a determination of the latent causalities. The main findings indicate that perceived attitudes towards financial and nonfinancial benefits, followed by informal peers, best estimate the attitude change, whereas traditional sociodemographic factors, knowledge and affordability may not engender a shift. Leveraging from this new paradigm can encourage current PV consumers to take another step and become earlier battery adopters. Failure to recognise these dynamics may breed despair and turn current innovators and early adopters of PVs into late adopters or rejectors of battery systems.

TI  - Supporting Procedural Fidelity of Behavioral Interventions for Children With Autism via an Artificial Intelligence Platform
T2  - BEHAVIORAL INTERVENTIONS
AB  - Access to behavior analytic services is limited and often unavailable for many in areas with a dearth of qualified providers. Tools to support behavior-change agents located in the natural environment of consumers may be a way to provide behavioral interventions. An artificial intelligence (AI) platform that guides the implementation of behavioral interventions may be useful for supporting procedural fidelity. The current studies evaluated whether an AI platform was effective at increasing and maintaining high levels of procedural fidelity in individuals with little to no prior training. Participants were two behavior technicians in training (Exp. 1) and three caregivers (Exp. 2). Introducing guidance provided by the AI platform GAINS improved the procedural fidelity with which behavior technicians and caregivers implemented behavioral interventions with children with autism, except for one caregiver. These results suggest AI platforms may be useful tools for supporting high levels of procedural fidelity by novice users.

AB  - This paper presents a virtual coach for older adults at home to support active and healthy aging, and independent living. It aids users in their behavior change process for improving on cognitive, physical, social interaction and nutrition areas using SMART goals. To achieve an effective behavior change of the user, the coach relies on the I-Change behavioral change model. Using a combination of projectors, cameras, microphones and support sensors, the older adult's home becomes an augmented reality environment, where common objects are used for projection and sensed. Older adults interact with this virtual coach in their home in a natural way using speech and body gestures (including touch in certain objects) on projected user interfaces in common objects at home.

TI  - Leveraging Artificial Intelligence for Expediting Implementation Efforts
T2  - CREATIVE NURSING
AB  - Expedited implementation of evidence into practice and policymaking is critical to ensure the delivery of effective care and improve health-care outcomes. Implementation science deals with the designing of methods and strategies for increasing and facilitating the uptake of evidence into practice and policymaking. Nevertheless, the process of designing and selecting methods and strategies for implementing evidence is complicated because of the complexity of health-care settings where implementation is desired. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized a range of fields, including genomics, education, drug trials, research, and health care. This commentary discusses how AI can be leveraged to expedite implementation science efforts for transforming health-care practice. Four key aspects of AI use in implementation science are highlighted: (a) AI for implementation planning (e.g., needs assessment, predictive analytics, and data management), (b) AI for developing implementation tools and guidelines, (c) AI for designing and applying implementation strategies, and (d) AI for monitoring and evaluating implementation outcomes. Use of AI along the implementation continuum from planning to delivery and evaluation can enable more precise and accurate implementation of evidence into practice.

TI  - Achieving trust in health-behavior-change artificial intelligence apps (HBC-AIApp) development: A multi-perspective guide
T2  - JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL INFORMATICS
AB  - Objective: Trust determines the success of Health-Behavior-Change Artificial Intelligence Apps (HBC-AIApp). Developers of such apps need theory-based practical methods that can guide them in achieving such trust. Our study aimed to develop a comprehensive conceptual model and development process that can guide developers how to build HBC-AIApp in order to support trust creation among the app's users.Methods: We apply a multi-disciplinary approach where medical informatics, human-centered design, and holistic health methods are integrated to address the trust challenge in HBC-AIApps. The integration extends a conceptual model of trust in AI developed by Jermutus et al., whose properties guide the extension of the IDEAS (integrate, design, assess, and share) HBC-App development process.Results: The HBC-AIApp framework consists of three main blocks: (1) system development methods that study the users' complex reality, hence, their perceptions, needs, goals and environment; (2) mediators and other stakeholders who are important for developing and operating the HBC-AIApp, boundary objects that examine users' activities via the HBC-AIApp; and (3) the HBC-AIApp's structural components, AI logic, and physical implementation. These blocks come together to provide the extended conceptual model of trust in HBC-AIApps and the extended IDEAS process.Discussion: The developed HBC-AIApp framework drew from our own experience in developing trust in HBCAIApp. Further research will focus on studying the application of the proposed comprehensive HBC-AIApp development framework and whether applying it supports trust creation in such apps.

T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective This study presents a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the usability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of a mobile app-based relational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot (Exerbot) intervention for increasing physical activity behavior. Methods The study was conducted over a 1-week period, during which participants were randomized to either converse with a baseline chatbot without relational capacity (control group) or a relational chatbot using social relational communication strategies. Objectively measured physical activity data were collected using smartphone pedometers. Results The study was feasible in enrolling a sample of 36 participants and with a 94% retention rate after 1 week. Daily engagement rate with the AI chatbot reached over 88% across the groups. Findings revealed that the control group experienced a significant decrease in steps on the final day, whereas the group interacting with the relational chatbot maintained their step counts throughout the study period. Importantly, individuals who engaged with the relational chatbot reported a stronger social bond with the chatbot compared to those in the control group. Conclusions Leveraging AI chatbot and the relationship-building capabilities of AI holds promise in the development of cost-effective, accessible, and sustainable behavior change interventions. This approach may benefit individuals with limited access to conventional in-person behavior interventions.

TI  - Rationally trust, but emotionally? The roles of cognitive and affective trust in laypeople's acceptance of AI for preventive care operations
T2  - PRODUCTION AND OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals' acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers' operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI-based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new-age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers' health behavior are also provided.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Behavioral Science Through the Looking Glass: Challenges for Real-World Application
T2  - ANNALS OF BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Background Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the process of scientific research. AI, coupled with availability of large datasets and increasing computational power, is accelerating progress in areas such as genetics, climate change and astronomy [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada; Hausen R, Robertson BE. Morpheus: A deep learning framework for the pixel-level analysis of astronomical image data. Astrophys J Suppl Ser. 2020;248:20; Dias R, Torkamani A. AI in clinical and genomic diagnostics. Genome Med. 2019;11:70.]. The application of AI in behavioral science is still in its infancy and realizing the promise of AI requires adapting current practices.
   Purposes By using AI to synthesize and interpret behavior change intervention evaluation report findings at a scale beyond human capability, the HBCP seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities. We explore challenges facing AI adoption in behavioral science through the lens of lessons learned during the Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP).
   Methods The project used an iterative cycle of development and testing of AI algorithms. Using a corpus of published research reports of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions, behavioral science experts annotated occurrences of interventions and outcomes. AI algorithms were trained to recognize natural language patterns associated with interventions and outcomes from the expert human annotations. Once trained, the AI algorithms were used to predict outcomes for interventions that were checked by behavioral scientists.
   Results Intervention reports contain many items of information needing to be extracted and these are expressed in hugely variable and idiosyncratic language used in research reports to convey information makes developing algorithms to extract all the information with near perfect accuracy impractical. However, statistical matching algorithms combined with advanced machine learning approaches created reasonably accurate outcome predictions from incomplete data.
   Conclusions AI holds promise for achieving the goal of predicting outcomes of behavior change interventions, based on information that is automatically extracted from intervention evaluation reports. This information can be used to train knowledge systems using machine learning and reasoning algorithms.

TI  - Using Artificial Intelligence in Infection Prevention
T2  - CURRENT TREATMENT OPTIONS IN INFECTIOUS DISEASES
AB  - Purpose of ReviewArtificial intelligence (AI) offers huge potential in infection prevention and control (IPC). We explore its potential IPC benefits in epidemiology, laboratory infection diagnosis, and hand hygiene.Recent FindingsAI has the potential to detect transmission events during outbreaks or predict high-risk patients, enabling development of tailored IPC interventions. AI offers opportunities to enhance diagnostics with objective pattern recognition, standardize the diagnosis of infections with IPC implications, and facilitate the dissemination of IPC expertise. AI hand hygiene applications can deliver behavior change, though it requires further evaluation in different clinical settings. However, staff can become dependent on automatic reminders, and performance returns to baseline if feedback is removed.SummaryAdvantages for IPC include speed, consistency, and capability of handling infinitely large datasets. However, many challenges remain; improving the availability of high-quality representative datasets and consideration of biases within preexisting databases are important challenges for future developments. AI in itself will not improve IPC; this requires culture and behavior change. Most studies to date assess performance retrospectively so there is a need for prospective evaluation in the real-life, often chaotic, clinical setting. Close collaboration with IPC experts to interpret outputs and ensure clinical relevance is essential.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Orthodontic Smart Application for Treatment Coaching and Its Impact on Clinical Performance of Patients Monitored with AI-TeleHealth System
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Background: Treatment of malocclusion with clear removable appliances like Invisalign(R) or Spark (TM), require considerable higher level of patient compliance when compared to conventional fixed braces. The clinical outcomes and treatment efficiency strongly depend on the patient's discipline. Smart treatment coaching applications, like strojCHECK(R) are efficient for improving patient compliance. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of computerized personalized decision algorithms responding to observed and anticipated patient behavior implemented as an update of an existing clinical orthodontic application (app). Materials and Methods: Variables such as (1) patient app interaction, (2) patient app discipline and (3) clinical aligner tracking evaluated by artificial intelligence system (AI) system-Dental monitoring(R) were observed on the set of 86 patients. Two 60-day periods were evaluated; before and after the app was updated with decision tree processes. Results: All variables showed significant improvement after the update except for the manifestation of clinical non-tracking in men, evaluated by artificial intelligence from video scans. Conclusions: Implementation of application update including computerized decision processes can significantly enhance clinical performance of existing health care applications and improve patients' compliance. Using the algorithm with decision tree architecture could create a baseline for further machine learning optimization.

TI  - Role of artificial intelligence in operations environment: a review and bibliometric analysis
T2  - TQM JOURNAL
AB  - Purpose - "Technological intelligence" is the capacity to appreciate and adapt technological advancements, and "artificial intelligence" is the key to achieve persuasive operational transformations in majority of contemporary organizational set-ups. Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics.
   Design/methodology/approach - As rightly remarked by past researchers that reviewing is learning from experience, research team has reviewed (by applying systematic literature review through bibliometric analysis) the concept of artificial intelligence in this article. A sum of 1,854 articles extracted from Scopus database for the year 2018-2019 (31st of May) with selected keywords (artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, agent-based systems, expert systems, big data analytics and operations management) along with certain filters (subject-business, management and accounting; language-English; document-article, article in press, review articles and source-journals).
   Findings - Results obtained from cluster analysis focus on predominant themes for present as well as future researchers in the area of artificial intelligence. Emerged clusters include Cluster 1: Artificial Intelligence and Optimization; Cluster 2: Industrial Engineering/Research and Automation; Cluster 3: Operational Performance and Machine Learning; Cluster 4: Sustainable Supply Chains and Sustainable Development; Cluster 5: Technology Adoption and Green Supply Chain Management and Cluster 6: Internet of Things and Reverse Logistics.
   Originality/value - The result of review of selected studies is in itself a unique contribution and a food for thought for operations managers and policy makers.

TI  - A human-centered perspective on research challenges for hybrid human artificial intelligence in lifestyle and behavior change support
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - As intelligent systems become more integrated into people's daily life, systems designed to facilitate lifestyle and behavior change for health and well-being have also become more common. Previous work has identified challenges in the development and deployment of such AI-based support for diabetes lifestyle management and shown that it is necessary to shift the design process of AI-based support systems towards a human-centered approach that can be addressed by hybrid intelligence (HI). However, this shift also means adopting a user-centric design process, which brings its own challenges in terms of stakeholder involvement, evaluation processes and ethical concerns. In this perspective paper, we aim to more comprehensively identify challenges and future research directions in the development of HI systems for behavior change from four different viewpoints: (1) challenges on an individual level, such as understanding the individual end-user's context (2) challenges on an evaluation level, such as evaluation pipelines and identifying success criteria and (3) challenges in addressing ethical implications. We show that developing HI systems for behavior change is an interdisciplinary process that requires further collaboration and consideration from various fields.

TI  - Validation of a Design Architecture to Deliver Health Management and Behavior Change Evidence at Scale
T2  - ROLE OF DIGITAL HEALTH POLICY AND LEADERSHIP
CP  - Future of Health Leadership, Informatics and Policy conference
AB  - Forty-four percent of Canadians over the age of 20 have a non-communicable disease (NCD). Millions of Canadians are at risk of developing the complications of NCDs; millions have already experienced those complications. Fortunately, the evidence base for NCD prevention and behavior change is large and growing and digital technologies can deliver them at scale and with high fidelity. However, the current model of in-person primary care is not designed nor capable of operationalizing that evidence. New developments in artificial intelligence that can predict who will develop NCD or the complications of NCD are increasingly available, making the challenge of delivering disease prevention even more urgent. This paper presents findings from stakeholder engagement on a design architecture to address three initial barriers to large-scale deployment of health management and behavior change evidence: 1) the challenges of regulating mobile health apps, 2) the challenge of creating a value-based rationale for payers to invest in deploying mobile health apps at scale, and 3) the high cost of customer acquisition for delivering mobile health apps to those at risk.

TI  - Principles and Validations of an Artificial Intelligence-Based Recommender System Suggesting Acceptable Food Changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUTRITION
AB  - Background: Along with the popularity of smartphones, artificial intelligence-based personalized suggestions can be seen as promising ways to change eating habits toward more desirable diets. Objectives: Two issues raised by such technologies were addressed in this study. The first hypothesis tested is a recommender system based on automatically learning simple association rules between dishes of the same meal that would make it possible to identify plausible substitutions for the consumer. The second hypothesis tested is that for an identical set of dietary-swaps suggestions, the more the user is-or thinks to be-involved in the process of identifying the suggestion, the higher is their probability of accepting the suggestion.Methods: Three studies are presented in this article, first, we present the principles of an algorithm to mine plausible substitutions from a large food consumption database. Second, we evaluate the plausibility of these automatically mined suggestions through the results of online tests conducted for a group of 255 adult participants. Afterward, we investigated the persuasiveness of 3 suggestion methods of such recommendations in a population of 27 healthy adult volunteers through a custom designed smartphone application.Results: The results firstly indicated that a method based on automatic learning of substitution rules between foods performed relatively well identifying plausible swaps suggestions. Regarding the form that should be used to suggest, we found that when users are involved in selecting the most appropriate recommendation for them, the resulting suggestions were more accepted (OR 1/4 3.168; P < 0.0004).Conclusions: This work indicates that food recommendation algorithms can gain efficiency by taking into account the consumption context and user engagement in the recommendation process. Further research is warranted to identify nutritionally relevant suggestions.

TI  - Beyond ideals: why the (medical) AI industry needs to motivate behavioural change in line with fairness and transparency values, and how it can do it
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly relied upon by clinicians for making diagnostic and treatment decisions, playing an important role in imaging, diagnosis, risk analysis, lifestyle monitoring, and health information management. While research has identified biases in healthcare AI systems and proposed technical solutions to address these, we argue that effective solutions require human engagement. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on how to motivate the adoption of these solutions and promote investment in designing AI systems that align with values such as transparency and fairness from the outset. Drawing on insights from psychological theories, we assert the need to understand the values that underlie decisions made by individuals involved in creating and deploying AI systems. We describe how this understanding can be leveraged to increase engagement with de-biasing and fairness-enhancing practices within the AI healthcare industry, ultimately leading to sustained behavioral change via autonomy-supportive communication strategies rooted in motivational and social psychology theories. In developing these pathways to engagement, we consider the norms and needs that govern the AI healthcare domain, and we evaluate incentives for maintaining the status quo against economic, legal, and social incentives for behavior change in line with transparency and fairness values.

TI  - Telehealth Behavioral Intervention for Diabetes Management in Adults With Physical Disabilities: Intervention Fidelity Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem among people with physical disabilities. Health coaching has been proven to be an effective approach in terms of behavioral changes, patient self-efficacy, adherence to treatment, health service use, and health outcomes. Telehealth systems combined with health coaching have the potential to improve the quality of health care by increasing access to services. Treatment fidelity is particularly important for behavior change studies; however, fidelity protocols are inadequately administered and reported in the literature.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to outline all the intervention fidelity strategies and procedures of a telecoaching intervention-artificial intelligence for diabetes management (AI4DM)-which is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a telehealth platform in adults with type 2 diabetes and permanent impaired mobility. AI4DM aims to create a web-based disability-inclusive diabetes self-management program. We selected the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) fidelity framework to describe strategies to ensure intervention fidelity in our research.
   Methods: We have developed fidelity strategies based on the five fidelity domains outlined by the NIH BCC-focusing on study design, provider training, treatment delivery, treatment receipt, and enactment of treatment skills. The design of the study is grounded in the social cognitive theory and is intended to ensure that both arms would receive the same amount of attention from the intervention. All providers will receive standardized training to deliver consistent health coaching to the participants. The intervention will be delivered through various controlling and monitoring strategies to reduce differences within and between treatment groups. The content and structure of the study are delivered to ensure comprehension and participation among individuals with low health literacy. By constantly reviewing and monitoring participant progress and protocol adherence, we intend to ensure that participants use cognitive and behavioral skills in real-world settings to engage in health behavior.
   Results: Enrollment for AI4DM will begin in October 2021 and end in October 2022. The results of this study will be reported in late 2022.
   Conclusions: Developing and using fidelity protocols in behavior change studies is essential to ensure the internal and external validity of interventions. This study incorporates NIH BCC recommendations into an artificial intelligence embedded telecoaching platform for diabetes management designed for people with physical disabilities. The developed fidelity protocol can provide guidance for other researchers conducting telehealth interventions within behavioral health settings to present more consistent and reproducible research.

TI  - AI-supported Health Coaching Model for Patients with Chronic Diseases
T2  - 2019 16TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS (ISWCS)
CP  - 16th International Symposium on Wireless Communication Systems (ISWCS)
AB  - The global expenditure of healthcare systems on the management of chronic diseases is exhausting costs and efforts. This is due to the delicate nature of patients needing care constantly, as well as the chronic nature of the diseases. These two causes force patients to pay visits to their healthcare providers more frequently. Repetitive visits are countless, short in time, unmanageable and ineffective. The state of the art for managing chronic diseases focus on a shared effort between the patient and the physician in an ongoing process of collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and finally adapting the management program by the physician and the patient. Technology along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) made these processes easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to introduce models that integrated AI in health coaching plans for patients with chronic diseases. As health coaching is an integral part of some countries public health strategy. It is now used as a complementary medical intervention to shape healthy behavior change. In this paper we propose a model that puts health coaching along with AI in its core to 1. empower patients to effectively manage their chronic conditions 2. as well as to persuade them to adhere to their care management program for extended periods of time.

TI  - CAN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PREFERENCES BE AN ALTERNATIVE TO HUMAN LINGUISTIC CHOICES? A MULTIDIMENSIONAL ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH ABSTRACTS OF ENGLISH LINGUISTICS
T2  - JOURNAL OF NUSANTARA STUDIES-JONUS
AB  - Background and Purpose: With the rapid advancements in generative AI, understanding its ability to emulate human language conventions is crucial. This work aims to analyze the possibility of applying AI technology in language production by comparing the lexico-grammatical features of abstracts created with the help of ChatGPT and written by British and American researchers. Methodology: Twenty papers written by researchers affiliated with UK universities and twenty by researchers affiliated with American universities were selected from the journals listed under the first quartile of the Web of Science and Scopus. Using the titles that were from the selected works, 40 abstracts were generated from ChatGPT for comparison. Each article was introduced with its title, and ChatGPT was asked to create an abstract based on the title. Subsequently, the subjects were examined with the help of Biber's (1991) multivariate model considering five dimensions, which include the Informational vs Involved discourse, the Narrative vs Non-narrative, the Explicit vs. Situation- dependent discourse, Overt expression of argumentation/persuasion and the Impersonal/Abstract style as opposed to the Nonimpersonal/Non-abstract style. Findings: The five factors analysed in the texts give evidence that ChatGPT generates more information- centric, non-narrative, argumentative, and less abstractive discourse than human researchers. Contributions: The results of the study show the possibilities for the further development of AI that helps to create language closer to human language.

TI  - Leveraging artificial intelligence-mediated communication for cancer prevention and control and drug addiction: A systematic review
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Objective To conduct a systematic review on Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication (AIMC) behavioral interventions in cancer prevention/control and substance use.Methods Eight databases were searched from 2017 to 2022 using the Population Intervention Control Outcome Study (PICOS) framework. We synthesized findings of AIMC-based interventions for adult populations in cancer prevention/control or substance use, applying SIGN Methodology Checklist 2 for quality assessments and reviewing retention and engagement.Results Initial screening identified 187 studies; seven met inclusion criteria, involving 2768 participants. Females comprised 67.6% (n = 1870). Mean participant age was 42.73 years (SD = 7.00). Five studies demonstrated significant improvements in substance use recovery, physical activity, genetic testing, or dietary habits.Conclusions AIMC shows promise in enhancing health behaviors, but further exploration is needed on privacy risks, biases, safety concerns, chatbot features, and serving underserved populations.Implications There is a critical need to foster comprehensive fully powered studies and collaborations between technology developers, healthcare providers, and researchers. Policymakers can facilitate the responsible integration of AIMC technologies into healthcare systems, ensuring equitable access and maximizing their impact on public health outcomes.
   We conducted a systematic review on behavioral interventions using Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication in the contexts of cancer prevention/control and substance use.
   Researchers conducted a thorough review of how Artificial Intelligence-Mediated Communication (AIMC) can influence behavior in cancer prevention/control and substance use. They analyzed seven studies involving nearly 2800 adults, mostly women, focusing on outcomes like substance use recovery and lifestyle changes. Six studies reported randomized controlled trials, focusing on interventions for substance use and other health behaviors. Several studies showed promising results, such as improved physical activity and dietary habits. Studies varied in design: one was a single-arm trial, while others had multiple arms or stratified randomization. Most trials used validated outcome measures and reported high retention rates. Despite promising results in behavior change, sustainability beyond treatment was rarely reported. Studies highlighted demographic diversity and employed intent-to-treat or per-protocol analyses. Challenges included blinding issues and potential biases. Overall, the trials emphasized the need for comprehensive, rigorous research in AI-mediated health interventions. The review highlighted the need for more research on privacy concerns, biases, and the effectiveness of AIMC tools, especially for underserved populations. The findings suggest that AIMC could play a significant role in improving public health, but more robust studies and collaborations are necessary to maximize its impact and ensure fair access in healthcare systems.

TI  - Worker Perspectives on Incorporating Artificial Intelligence into Office Workspaces: Implications for the Future of Office Work
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Workplace environments have a significant impact on worker performance, health, and well-being. With machine learning capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed to automate individualized adjustments to work environments (e.g., lighting, temperature) and to facilitate healthier worker behaviors (e.g., posture). Worker perspectives on incorporating AI into office workspaces are largely unexplored. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore office workers' views on including AI in their office workspace. Six focus group interviews with a total of 45 participants were conducted. Interview questions were designed to generate discussion on benefits, challenges, and pragmatic considerations for incorporating AI into office settings. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an iterative approach. Two primary constructs emerged. First, participants shared perspectives related to preferences and concerns regarding communication and interactions with the technology. Second, numerous conversations highlighted the dualistic nature of a system that collects large amounts of data; that is, the potential benefits for behavior change to improve health and the pitfalls of trust and privacy. Across both constructs, there was an overarching discussion related to the intersections of AI with the complexity of work performance. Numerous thoughts were shared relative to future AI solutions that could enhance the office workplace. This study's findings indicate that the acceptability of AI in the workplace is complex and dependent upon the benefits outweighing the potential detriments. Office worker needs are complex and diverse, and AI systems should aim to accommodate individual needs.

TI  - Personalized cardiometabolic care powered by artificial intelligence
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY
AB  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are providing a wealth of opportunities for improving clinical practice and healthcare delivery. It is predicted by AI experts that healthcare will change more in the next decade than it has in the previous century due to the volume and speed of these advancing capabilities. In this paper, we will illustrate the potential value of AI by sharing an example of an AI-powered digital health platform, designed to support people living with chronic cardiometabolic conditions and their care teams. The goal is to transform the care continuum from prevention through diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management, including efficient acute care interventions when needed. The intent is to shift from reactive to proactive care including preventive-based guidance and interventions. AI-powered health technologies enable true person-centered care (i.e., for N=1), but for entire populations at scale (i.e., N >> 1), shifting the traditional mass generalization paradigm to one of mass customization. We demonstrate how an AI-powered digital health platform: 1) supports early detection and diagnosis of chronic conditions such as diabetes and related cardiometabolic conditions with data and insights; 2) optimizes personalized treatment; 3) tracks progress; 4) provides education; and 5) enables longitudinal behavior change to sustain health. We will present current AI capabilities as well as future considerations for the industry. We will also discuss principles that govern the responsible adoption of AI capabilities in healthcare to complement, not replace, the clinician.

TI  - The Effect of Balancing Methods on Model Behavior in Imbalanced Classification Problems
T2  - FIFTH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON LEARNING WITH IMBALANCED DOMAINS: THEORY AND APPLICATIONS
CP  - 5th International Workshop on Learning with Imbalanced Domains - Theory and Applications / European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML PKDD)
AB  - Imbalanced data poses a significant challenge in classification as model performance is affected by insufficient learning from minority classes. Balancing methods are often used to address this problem. However, such techniques can lead to problems such as overfitting or loss of information. This study addresses a more challenging aspect of balancing methods - their impact on model behavior. To capture these changes, Explainable Artificial Intelligence tools are used to compare models trained on datasets before and after balancing. In addition to the Variable Importance method, this study uses Partial Dependence and Accumulated Local Effects profiles. Real and simulated datasets are tested, and an open-source Python package edgaro is developed to facilitate this analysis. The results obtained show significant changes in model behavior due to balancing methods, which can lead to biased models toward a balanced distribution. These findings confirm that balancing analysis should go beyond model performance comparisons to achieve higher reliability of machine learning models. Therefore, we propose a new method performance gain plot for informed data balancing strategy to make an optimal selection of balancing method by analyzing the measure of change in model behavior versus performance gain.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL AND INTERACTIVE ARTS, ARTECH 2023
CP  - 11th International Conference on Digital and Interactive Arts (ARTECH) - Digital Creation Processes
AB  - Policy mandates in addressing climate change are hindered by a lack of intrinsic motivation amongst participants to take collective action. Instead of overt persuasion, this study applied generative AI tools to speculative imagining of future climate scenarios and their adaptation strategies, using a workshop to encourage participants to align themselves with climate action. Participants used text-to-image tools to generate visions of the future in speculative scenarios, then prompted ChatGPT for potential solutions in these scenarios. They then asked text-to-image again to visualize the ChatGPT suggestions. Participants encountered difficulties editing or removing visual elements, dealt with the lack of transparency in the generation process by specifying the physical layout as opposed to the semantics, and collaboratively developed linguistic strategies for visual depiction of novel artifacts. This work shows how generative tools can be used to prototype future scenarios and envision designs that serve social purposes.

TI  - The Differential Impact of AI Salience on Advertising Engagement and Attitude: Scary Good AI Advertising
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH
AB  - Across four studies, the authors find that AI-salient advertising generates greater online engagement (e.g., comment word count) but evokes more negative than positive emotions that impact ad attitude. AI salience, the degree to which the consumer perceives that artificial intelligence played a role in creating the advertisement, is introduced as an important factor that marketing practitioners must consider as they implement AI-generated advertising content (e.g., imagery). Using a theoretical foundation in the psychology of fear, we show that negative emotions evoke reactance, thus compromising ad attitude.

TI  - On How Chronic Conditions Affect the Patient-AI Interaction: A Literature Review
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Background: Across the globe, managing chronic diseases has been recognized as a challenge for patients and healthcare providers. The state of the art in managing chronic conditions requires not only responding to the clinical needs of the patient, but also guaranteeing a comfortable state of wellbeing for them, despite living with the disease. This demands mutual effort between the patient and the physician in constantly collecting data, monitoring, and understanding the disease. The advent of artificial intelligence has made this process easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to analyze how the different artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are used to manage different types of chronic conditions. Objective: Throughout this grounded theory literature review, we aim to provide an overview for the features that characterize artificial intelligence based health coaching systems used by patients with chronic diseases. Methods: During our search and paper selection process process, we use three bibliographic libraries (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library). Using the grounded theory, we extract overarching themes for the artificial intelligence based health coaching systems. These systems are then classified according to their role, platform, type of interaction with the patient, as well as targeted chronic conditions. Of 869 citations retrieved, 31 unique studies are included in this review. Results: The included studies assess 14 different chronic conditions. Common roles for AI-based health coaching systems are: developing adherence, informing, motivating, reminding, preventing, building a care network, and entertaining. Health coaching systems combine the aforementioned roles to cater to the needs of the patients. The combinations of these roles differ between multilateral, unilateral, opposing bilateral, complementing bilateral, one-role-missing, and the blurred role combinations. Conclusion: Clinical solutions and research related to artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are very limited. Clear guidelines to help develop artificial intelligence-based health coaching systems are still blurred. This grounded theory literature review attempted to shed the light on the research and development requirements for an effective health coaching system intended for patients with chronic conditions. Researchers are recommended to use this review to identify the most suitable role combination for an effective health coaching system development.

TI  - Argument-based human-AI collaboration for supporting behavior change to improve health
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - This article presents an empirical requirement elicitation study for an argumentation-based digital companion for supporting behavior change, whose ultimate goal is the promotion and facilitation of healthy behavior. The study was conducted with non-expert users as well as with health experts and was in part supported by the development of prototypes. It focuses on human-centric aspects, in particular user motivations, as well as on expectations and perceptions regarding the role and interaction behavior of a digital companion. Based on the results of the study, a framework for person tailoring the agent's roles and behaviors, and argumentation schemes are proposed. The results indicate that the extent to which a digital companion argumentatively challenges or supports a user's attitudes and chosen behavior and how assertive and provocative the companion is may have a substantial and individualized effect on user acceptance, as well as on the effects of interacting with the digital companion. More broadly, the results shed some initial light on the perception of users and domain experts of "soft," meta-level aspects of argumentative dialogue, indicating potential for future research.

AB  - Human mobility patterns can be identified through the analysis of GPS and smartphone data. This identification has been the theme of several studies, particularly in the smart cities domain. Considering that patterns identify human routines, changes in these patterns may also provide useful information. This paper reports the analysis of GPS data from a group of Chinese in Beijing from April 2009 till October 2012, identifying routine routing patterns and sudden collective breaks on those patterns. Artificial Intelligence techniques were used to identify mobility patterns. Olympic games dates and the 2009 pollution peak were identified though our method. We believe it can be a powerful tool to infer mass events occurring in any part of the world.

TI  - The Design and Development of a Personalized Leisure Time Physical Activity Application Based on Behavior Change Theories, End-User Perceptions, and Principles From Empirical Data Mining
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Introduction: Many adults do not reach the recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines, which can lead to serious health problems. A promising method to increase PA is the use of smartphone PA applications. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple PA apps, it remains unclear how to develop and design engaging and effective PA apps. Furthermore, little is known on ways to harness the potential of artificial intelligence for developing personalized apps. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the Playful data-driven Active Urban Living (PAUL): a personalized PA application.
   Methods: The two-phased development process of the PAUL apps rests on principles from the behavior change model; the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework; and the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model. During the first phase, we explored whether location-specific information on performing PA in the built environment is an enhancement to a PA app. During the second phase, the other modules of the app were developed. To this end, we first build the theoretical foundation for the PAUL intervention by performing a literature study. Next, a focus group study was performed to translate the theoretical foundations and the needs and wishes in a set of user requirements. Since the participants indicated the need for reminders at a for-them-relevant moment, we developed a self-learning module for the timing of the reminders. To initialize this module, a data-mining study was performed with historical running data to determine good situations for running.
   Results: The results of these studies informed the design of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) application for running, walking, and performing strength exercises. The app is implemented as a set of modules based on the persuasive strategies "monitoring of behavior," "feedback," "goal setting," "reminders," "rewards," and "providing instruction." An architecture was set up consisting of a smartphone app for the user, a back-end server for storage and adaptivity, and a research portal to provide access to the research team.
   Conclusions: The interdisciplinary research encompassing psychology, human movement sciences, computer science, and artificial intelligence has led to a theoretically and empirically driven leisure time PA application. In the current phase, the feasibility of the PAUL app is being assessed.

AB  - The Theory of Transforming Wellbeing (TTW) is emerging as an inevitable response to the ever-growing imbalance in our lives across the globe. Over the decades, we have been advancing technologies to make our lives better. The fundamental question still remains: with all the evolving innovations, are we gaining decent success in achieving happier and more sustainable societies? All the crucial domains of our lives continuously provide evidence of things getting disbalanced despite us making huge progress in building increasingly capable technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and drones, just to name a few. The TTW advances scientific knowledge and its practical applications to transform lives. Due to its strong fundament that blends technological innovations with human nature, TTW is applicable in many essential life contexts, including health, education, sustainability, equality, governance, safety, emergency, ecology, and economy.

T2  - EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND PROCESS MINING APPLICATIONS FOR HEALTHCARE, XAI-HEALTHCARE 2023 & PM4H 2023
CP  - 21st Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIME) Conference / 3rd International Workshop on Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare (XAI-Healthcare) / 1st International Workshop on Process Mining Applications for Healthcare (PM4H)
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can issue smart, contextsensitive recommendations to help patients self-manage their illnesses, including medication regimens, dietary habits, physical activity, and avoiding flare-ups. Instead of merely positing an "edict," the AI model can also explain why the recommendation was issued: why one should stay indoors (e.g., increased risk of flare-ups), why further calorie intake should be avoided (e.g., met the daily limit), or why the care provider should be contacted (e.g., prescription change). The goal of these explanations is to achieve understanding and persuasion effects, which, in turn, targets education and long-term behavior change. Symbolic AI models facilitate explanations as they are able to offer logical proofs of inferences (or recommendations) from which explanations can be generated. We implemented a modular framework called XAIN (eXplanations for AI in Notation3) to explain symbolic reasoning inferences in a trace-based, contrastive, and counterfactual way. We applied this framework to explain recommendations for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients to avoid flare-ups. For evaluation, we propose a questionnaire that captures understanding, persuasion, education, and behavior change, together with traditional XAI metrics including fidelity (soundness, completeness) and interpretability (parsimony, clarity).

TI  - Chatbots as extenders of pediatric obesity intervention: an invited commentary on "Feasibility of Pediatric Obesity & Pre-Diabetes Treatment Support through Tess, the AI Behavioral Coaching Chatbot"
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Despite our best efforts, pediatric obesity remains an important public health issue. Although many different approaches to address this condition have been utilized, few have achieved long-term success. Technology is increasingly being explored as a convenient and accessible method for delivering behavioral interventions. Stephens and colleagues report the feasibility of using a behavioral coaching social chatbot, Tess, to extend a multicomponent pediatric obesity intervention for adolescents. We examine the pros and cons of this approach. Although social chatbots offer an interesting and novel method for promoting round-the-clock support, important issues and decisions must be carefully considered during the design phase to help ensure a safe environment for a vulnerable population.

TI  - Use of Artificial-Intelligence-Based Chatbots to Promote Physical Activity: A Systematic Review of Interventions
T2  - KINESIOLOGY REVIEW
AB  - Background: Artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered chatbots have been increasingly utilized in interventions to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyle behaviors. This systematic review explored the effectiveness of these chatbots in physical activity interventions. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using comprehensive searches across PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and the Cochrane Library. Studies included were peer-reviewed intervention studies utilizing AI-powered chatbots designed to promote physical activity, conducted from 2010 onward and published in English. Results: Of 11,347 articles identified, eight studies published between 2018 and 2023 met the inclusion criteria. Using randomized controlled trials or pre- post designs, these studies involved sample sizes from 15 to 116 participants. Interventions included chatbots, voice-activated assistants, and health-coaching applications in remote and controlled settings. Primary outcomes focused on physical activity metrics like moderate and vigorous physical activity and step counts, with secondary outcomes covering quality of life and engagement. Intervention effectiveness varied, with some showing significant improvements in physical activity while others had mixed results. Study quality assessment revealed generalizability, data collection, and missing data-handling limitations. Conclusion: AI-powered chatbots show promise as practical tools for promoting physical activity. They offer personalized, engaging, and scalable interventions that can be integrated into broader public health strategies. Despite their promise, the variability in effectiveness and inconsistencies in study quality underscore an urgent need for future research to standardize intervention designs and advance AI techniques for more reliable and scalable health outcomes.

TI  - Entropy-based Planning Algorithm for Personalized Interventions: Preliminary Report on Question-reduction Agent
T2  - COMPANION OF THE 2024 ACM INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON PERVASIVE AND UBIQUITOUS COMPUTING, UBICOMP COMPANION 2024
CP  - ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing / ACM International Symposium on Wearable Computers (UbiComp/ISWC)
AB  - Prevention of lifestyle diseases is an important issue in terms of both the lifelong well-being of each individual and the burden on society. Although several artificial-intelligence-based chatbots have been proposed to support preventing such diseases, they have not yet reached a complex problem setting that combines multiple theories of behavioral change. In such complex settings, in addition to intervention selection, it is important to reduce the amount of attributes acquired to reduce the user's burden in preventing inhibition of motivation. Therefore, we developed the Entropy-Based Planning algorithm that selects interventions from a small number of questions. To evaluate the algorithm, we conducted a short-term randomized control trial (RCT) with a small number of users as an initial validation. Due to certain limitations, we were unable to obtain results indicating sufficient effectiveness. However, important findings were obtained for the future development of behavioral-change support bots. The findings include the need to investigate the relevance of preferences among multiple behavior-change theories and balance the number of questions and accuracy of personalization on user impressions. We intend to conduct further research on the basis of these findings as well as conduct a large-scale RCT after improving the algorithm and experiment settings.

TI  - Perspective: Challenges for Personalized Nutrition in the Current United States Regulatory Framework and Future Opportunities
T2  - ADVANCES IN NUTRITION
AB  - Personalized nutrition (PN) aims to provide tailored dietary recommendations to improve a person's health outcomes by integrating a multitude of individual-level information and supporting desired behavior changes. The field is rapidly evolving with technological advances. As new biomarkers are discovered, wearables and other devices can now provide up-to-the-minute insights, and artificial intelligence and machine learning models support recommendations and lifestyle behavior change. Advancements in the field enhance the potential for tailored and effective programs but raise important questions regarding user safety, security, health, transparency, and privacy. The Personalized Nutrition Initiative at the University of Illinois held the workshop, "Challenges for Personalized Nutrition in the Current United States Regulatory Framework and Future Opportunities," to address regulatory implications of current PN programs, future innovation within the current framework, and existing complexities of oversight. A majority of PN programs combine multiple components, and these components may need to be regulated differently. The areas of food, supplements, in vitro diagnostics, and medical and wellness devices were described and discussed as they apply to PN programs. The speakers and discussants concluded that regulatory guidance for PN programs should focus on ensuring 1) safety and accuracy of the tests and devices, 2) credentialed and skilled experts develop the advice, 3) responsible and clear communication of information and benefits, 4) substantiation of scientific claims, and 5) procedures are implemented to protect user privacy. Furthermore, as this field incorporates new devices, biomarkers, behavior-based tools, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the need to adapt the existing regulatory framework was also considered. Working closely with regulatory bodies is required and should be an opportunity to provide users with transparency, build trust, and create a source of differentiation for PN innovators.

TI  - A Smartphone Healthcare Application, CALO mama Plus, to Promote Weight Loss: A Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - NUTRIENTS
AB  - Mobile applications are increasingly used in healthcare. We have developed a smartphone healthcare application, CALO mama Plus, that can register daily diet, exercise, mood, and sleep quality, calculate dietary intake, and provide advice using artificial intelligence technology. This 3-month randomized controlled trial tested the hypothesis that CALO mama Plus could promote body weight reduction in Japanese adults with overweight or obesity. We recruited office workers as participants. The key eligibility criteria were an age of 20-65 years and a body mass index of 23-40 kg/m(2). The primary outcome was body weight change over 3 months. We enrolled 141 participants and randomly assigned them to the intervention (n = 72) and control (n = 69) groups. The intervention group used CALO mama Plus, and the control group did not receive any intervention. The change in body weight was -2.4 +/- 4.0 kg and -0.7 +/- 3.3 kg in the intervention and control groups, respectively. An analysis of covariance adjusted for related variables showed a significant between-group difference in body weight change (-1.60 kg; 95% confidence interval -2.83 to -0.38; p = 0.011). The present study suggests that CALO mama Plus effectively promotes weight loss.

TI  - Can You Spot the AI? Incorporating GenAI into Technical Writing Assignments
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 26TH WESTERN CANADIAN CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING EDUCATION, WCCCE 2024
CP  - 26th Western Canadian Conference on Computing Education (WCCCE)
AB  - In an effort to foster critical reflection on the usage of generative AI (genAI) during computer science writing assignments, this three-part assignment challenges students to predict whether their peers can detect which essays are generated using AI. Implemented as part of a third-year professional responsibility and technical writing course for N=200 students during Spring 2024, students individually generated two short persuasive essays, one using genAI and the other without. They then combined the two essays into a single document and submitted it for peer-review. Additionally, they formulated a guess on whether their peers would be able to detect which essay was generated as well as a rationale for their guess. Following the peer-review process, students reflected on their own experience trying to detect which essays were generated as well as the outcome of their guess about their peers abilities as well. Feedback indicates its effectiveness in engaging students in their understanding of the potentials and limitations of genAI. Recommended prerequisites include a clear course AI-usage policy and a brief overview of genAI prompt engineering.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in Education: Big Data, Black Boxes, and Technological Solutionism
T2  - REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE TECNOLOGIA EDUCATIVA-RELATEC
AB  - The use of digital technology is constantly permeating and transforming all social systems, and education is not an exception. In the last decade, the development of Artificial Intelligence has given a new push to the hope of providing educational systems with 'effective' and more personalized solutions for teaching and learning. Educators, educational researchers, and policymakers, in general, lack the knowledge and expertise to understand the underlying logic of these new systems, and there is insufficient research based evidence to fully understand the consequences for learners' development of both the extensive use of screens and the increasing reliance on algorithms in educational settings. This article, geared towards educators, academics in the field of Education, and policymakers, first introduces the concepts of 'Big Data', Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning algorithms and how they are presented and deployed as 'black boxes', and the possible impact on education these new software solutions can have. Then, it focuses on the underlying educational discourses that historically have seen information and communication technologies as a panacea for solving educational problems, pointing out the need to analyse not only their advantages, but also their possible negative effects. It finishes with a short exploration of possible future scenarios and conclusions.

TI  - The effect of gender stereotypes on artificial intelligence recommendations
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This study explores the effects of gender stereotypes on evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations. We predict that gender stereotypes will affect human-AI interactions, resulting in somewhat different persuasive effects of AI recommendations for utilitarian vs. hedonic products. We found that participants in the male AI agent condition gave higher competence scores than in the female AI agent condition. Contrariwise, perceived warmth was higher in the female AI agent condition than in the male condition. More importantly, a significant interaction effect between AI gender and product type was found, suggesting that participants showed more positive attitudes toward the AI recommendations when the male AI recommended a utilitarian (vs. hedonic) product. Conversely, a hedonic product was evaluated more positively when advised by the female (vs. male) AI agent.

TI  - The Rise of Deepfakes: A Conceptual Framework and Research Agenda for Marketing
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
AB  - Deepfakes, digital content created via machine learning, a form of artificial intelligence technology, are generating interest among marketers and the general population alike and are often portrayed as a "phantom menace" in the media. Despite relevance to marketing theory and practice, deepfakes-and the opportunities for benefit or deviance they provide-are little understood or discussed. This article introduces deepfakes to the marketing literature and proposes a typology, conceptual framework, and associated research agenda, underpinned by theorizing based on balanced centricity, to guide the future investigation of deepfakes in marketing scholarship. The article makes an argument for balance (i.e., situations where all stakeholders benefit), and it is hoped that this article may provide a foundation for future research and application of deepfakes as "a new hope" for marketing.

TI  - Personalized Digital Health Communications to Increase COVID-19 Vaccination in Underserved Populations: A Double Diamond Approach to Behavioral Design
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing health disparities. People of historically underserved communities, including racial and ethnic minority groups and people with lower incomes and educational attainments, experienced disproportionate premature mortality, access to healthcare, and vaccination acceptance and adoption. At the same time, the pandemic increased reliance on digital devices, offering a unique opportunity to leverage digital communication channels to address health inequities, particularly related to COVID-19 vaccination. We offer a real-world, systematic approach to designing personalized behavior change email and text messaging interventions that address individual barriers with evidence-based behavioral science inclusive of underserved populations. Integrating design processes such as the Double Diamond model with evidence-based behavioral science intervention development offers a unique opportunity to create equitable interventions. Further, leveraging behavior change artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities allows for both personalizing and automating that personalization to address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination at scale. The result is an intervention whose broad component library meets the needs of a diverse population and whose technology can deliver the right components for each individual.

TI  - Artificial intelligence or the challenge of the century Anatomy of a radical antihumanism
T2  - COGNITION TECHNOLOGY & WORK
AB  - "Artificial Intelligence or the Challenge of the Century: Anatomy of a Radical Antihumanism" by eric Sadin examines, from a phenomenology of artifacts perspective, the evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and the challenges it poses. The author conceives AI as a global system composed of devices interconnected with beings and objects in the world, whose behavior is continuously monitored and digitally influenced through algorithms. Specifically, the power of this "algorithmic Leviathan" lies not only in its ability to handle vast amounts of information, rendering human minds dispensable, but also in its administration based on a numerical regime of truth. To comprehend this, Sadin introduces the concepts of "aletheic potency" and "kairos power." Aletheic potency refers to the persuasive capacity of AI to articulate "truths" that align with our preferences and expectations. On the other hand, kairos power enables AI to swiftly respond to its shortcomings through compensatory actions that minimize our dissatisfaction, thus keeping us captive within its infallible logic. In summary, the emergence of AI signifies a change in the status of technologies, challenging our relationship with the world, as it is expected to enunciate truth through automated interpretation of situations and make decisions on our behalf. This represents the stage of techno-logos of technique: not logos about technique produced by humans, but humans shaped by a technique capable of generating discourse or truth.

TI  - Using testimonial narratives to persuade people about artificial intelligence: the role of attitudinal similarity with the protagonist of the message
T2  - PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION
AB  - This study addresses the factors that increase the persuasive impact of testimonial narrative messages on artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, the effect on two variables that, to date, have not been explored in this field is analyzed: the attitudes toward AI (positive versus ambivalent) expressed by the protagonist of the narrative message (a testimonial in audiovisual format) and the role of participants' prior beliefs about AI. An online experiment (N = 652) was carried out to contrast the effect of attitudinal similarity on identification with the protagonist of the narrative message and the indirect effect on attitudes and intention to use AI. The results showed that the message whose protagonist expressed positive attitudes toward AI induced greater identification only in those participants with previous positive beliefs. In contrast, the message whose protagonist expressed ambivalent attitudes toward AI induced greater identification only among participants with previous negative beliefs. In addition, identification and cognitive elaboration were found to mediate the effect of attitudinal similarity on the attitude toward and intention to use AI. These findings are discussed in the context of narrative persuasion research and the development of campaigns for improving social perceptions of data science.

TI  - Feasibility of pediatric obesity and prediabetes treatment support through Tess, the AI behavioral coaching chatbot
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through various media, including Internet interventions, mobile apps, and video games. BITs present several possible benefits, including increased dissemination and accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, and decreased stigma, especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot, Tess, addresses different facets of behavioral health, such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7, Tess delivers customized integrative support, psychoeducation, and interventions through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e., SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23; M-age = 15.20 years; Range(age) = 9.78-18.54 years; 57% female) coping with weight management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to promote treatment adherence, behavior change, and overall wellness. Adolescent patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the time. The 4,123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings (96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of support through artificial intelligence, specifically in a pediatric setting, which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to clinicians, Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous learning, future iterations may have additional features to increase the user experience.

TI  - From Persuasion Theory to Climate Action: Insights and Future Directions for Increasing Climate-Friendly Behavior
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - Combatting climate change requires motivating individuals to adopt climate-friendly behaviors, whether to make individual lifestyle changes, vote for environmental policy, or accept technological innovations. Efforts to promote such behaviors can be more effective when informed by theoretically and empirically driven insights into human behavior change-an endeavor led by persuasion research. This review explores the intersection of persuasion research and climate-friendly behavior, demonstrating how persuasion theory can be applied to encourage climate action. Key theoretical approaches are examined, including the theory of planned behavior, social norms, narrative-based persuasion, framing, and emotional appeals, along with considerations for their practical applications. Additionally, promising future directions for integrating persuasion research into climate change interventions are highlighted; these include tailoring messages based on moral foundations theory and the transtheoretical model, as well as leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize climate-friendly recommendations. By synthesizing insights across persuasion and environmental research, this review provides valuable guidance for environmental researchers, policymakers, intervention designers, communication strategists, and environmental activists in developing robust and effective strategies to increase climate action at a time when accelerating these behaviors is more urgent than ever.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Persuasion: A Construal-Level Account
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Although more individuals are relying on information provided by nonhuman agents, such as artificial intelligence and robots, little research has examined how persuasion attempts made by nonhuman agents might differ from persuasion attempts made by human agents. Drawing on construal-level theory, we posited that individuals would perceive artificial agents at a low level of construal because of the agents' lack of autonomous goals and intentions, which directs individuals' focus toward how these agents implement actions to serve humans rather than why they do so. Across multiple studies (total N = 1,668), we showed that these construal-based differences affect compliance with persuasive messages made by artificial agents. These messages are more appropriate and effective when the message represents low-level as opposed to high-level construal features. These effects were moderated by the extent to which an artificial agent could independently learn from its environment, given that learning defies people's lay theories about artificial agents.

Their effectiveness depends on the quality of their design. Frameworks for DSG design can guide the creation of engaging gamestailored to objectives such as education, health, and social impact. Objective:This study aims to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature on digital entertainment game design frameworks and DSG design frameworks (DSGDFWs). Thefocus is on conceptual frameworks offering high-level guidanceforthegame creation process rather than component-specific tools. We explore how these frameworks can be applied to create impactful serious gamesin fields such as health care and education. Key goals include identifying design principles, commonalities, dependencies, gaps, and opportunities in the literature. Suggestions for future research includeempathic design thinking, artificial intelligence integration, and iterative improvements. The findings culminate in a synthesized 4-phase design process, offering generic guidelines for designers and developers to create effective serious games that benefit society. Methods: A 2-phase methodology was used: a scoping literature review and cluster analysis. A targeted search across 7 databases (ACM, Scopus, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, JMIR Publications, and SAGE) was conducted using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Studies included academic or industry papers evaluating digital game design frameworks. Cluster analysis was applied to categorize the data, revealing trends and correlations among frameworks. Results: Of 987 papers initially identified, 25 (2.5%) met the inclusion criteria, with an additional 22 identified through snowballing, resulting in 47 papers. These papers presented 47 frameworks, including 16 (34%) digital entertainment game design frameworks and 31 (66%) DSGDFWs. Thematicanalysis grouped frameworks into categories, identifying patterns and relationships between design elements. Commonalities, dependencies, and gaps were analyzed, highlighting opportunities for empathic design thinking and artificial intelligence applications. Key considerations in DSG design were identified and presented in a 4-phase design baseline with the outcome of a list of design guidelines that might, according to the literature, be applied to an end-to-end process of designing and building future innovative solutions. Conclusions:The main benefits of using DSGDFWs seem to be related to enhancing the effectiveness of serious gamesin achieving their intended objectives, such as learning, behavior change, and social impact. Limitations primarily seem to be related to constraints associated with the specific contexts in which the serious games are developed and used. Approaches in the future should be aimed at refining and adapting existing frameworks to different contexts and purposes, as well as exploring new frameworks that incorporate emerging technologies and design principles.

TI  - Artificial intelligence, marketing management, and ethics: their effect on customer loyalty intentions: A conceptual study
T2  - RETAIL AND MARKETING REVIEW
AB  - The purpose of this study was to address ethical issues of privacy, information security, discrimination, and diversity concerns in the Artificial intelligence context, and to show how they relate to customers' loyalty intentions. The outcome sought was the development of a conceptual model that relates these themes to the actions of marketing management practitioners. An extensive review of literature on Persuasive technology, Social penetration, and Transforming wellbeing theories formed the basic structure for this study. After reviewing and synthesizing empirical literature on the major themes, and linking them to the constructs extracted from the grounding theories, the author generated a list of propositions that relate them to each other and the constructs. These propositions led to the development of a conceptual model. Researchers that deal with ethical issues and new technology can empirically test this model. The conceptualized model extends the explanatory powers of these grounding theories, by showing how they can improve business practices under the fourth industrial revolution era. This can aid management practitioners on artificial intelligence management strategies, and mitigate negative consequences related to the application of advanced technologies in business. This study is based on the literature, and, therefore, carries with it all the limitations that are inherent in the articles accessed. Generalizing the proposals need to take into account the fact that the proposed framework has not yet been subjected to empirical testing.

TI  - Study Protocol for the Effects of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-Supported Automated Nutritional Intervention on Glycemic Control in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus
T2  - DIABETES THERAPY
AB  - IntroductionNutritional intervention is effective in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes but requires large inputs of manpower. Recent improvements in photo analysis technology facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and remote communication technologies have enabled automated evaluations of nutrient intakes. AI- and mobile-supported nutritional intervention is expected to be an alternative approach to conventional in-person nutritional intervention, but with less human resources, although supporting evidence is not yet complete. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that AI-supported nutritional intervention is as efficacious as the in-person, face-to-face method in terms of improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.MethodsThis is a multicenter, unblinded, parallel, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of AI-supported automated nutrition therapy with that of conventional human nutrition therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes mainly controlled with diet are to be recruited and randomly assigned to AI-supported nutrition therapy (n=50) and to human nutrition therapy (n=50). Asken, a mobile application whose nutritional evaluation has been already validated to that by the classical method of weighted dietary records, has been specially modified for this study so that it follows the recommendations of Japan Diabetes Society (total energy restriction with proportion of carbohydrates to fat to protein of 50-60, 20, and 20-30%, respectively).Planned OutcomesThe primary outcome is the change in glycated hemoglobin levels from baseline to 12months, and this outcome is to be compared between the two groups. The secondary outcomes are changes in fasting plasma glucose, plasma lipid profile, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressures, and urinary albumin excretion. The results of this randomized controlled trial will fill the gap between the demand for support of AI in nutritional interventions and the scientific evidence on its efficacy.Trial RegistrationUMIN000032231.

TI  - Identifying People Based on Machine Learning Classification of Foods Consumed in Order to Offer Tailored Healthier Food Options
T2  - INTELLIGENT HUMAN SYSTEMS INTEGRATION 2020
CP  - 3rd International Conference on Intelligent Human Systems Integration (IHSI) - Integrating People and Intelligent Systems
AB  - Using food recall data collected from over 8000 Americans, we used Machine Learning to classify a person's demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and income) based on the foods they consumed in a 24-h period. The best-performing models predicted gender correctly 61%, race 44%, and age 43% of the time on independent validation data. The model was subsequently used to provide tailored recommendations for healthier food options based on low-calorie and low-fat options for specific food groups that are typically consumed by other Americans that match the person's demographics. This system is part of a larger Smart Human-Centered System that assists users in recording the foods they consume, recognizes nutritional content of the food, offers tailored recommendations for consuming healthier foods, and tracking behavior change over time.

TI  - Creative Artificial Intelligence and Narrative Transportation
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY OF AESTHETICS CREATIVITY AND THE ARTS
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used to accomplish complex tasks, including the creation of artworks and entertainment products. Our focus here is on user responses to AI systems as authors of fictional stories. Across two experiments, we examined how the information that a story was written by AI influences narrative transportation and related experiences. In Experiment 1 (N = 325) the information that an AI had created a short story (contemporary fiction) reduced narrative transportation into this story. Experiment 2 (N = 489) was an extended replication in which genre differences (contemporary fiction vs. science fiction) were addressed. As expected, ostensible AI authorship reduced transportation, but this effect was qualified by genre: Whereas the AI-authorship effect was replicated for contemporary fiction stories, transportation did not differ between human and AI authorship when participants read science fiction stories. Across both experiments, individual differences (openness, affinity for technology and attitude toward AI) did not moderate the effect of AI authorship on any of the dependent variables.

TI  - Affective, cognitive, and contextual cues in Reddit posts on artificial intelligence
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE
AB  - Artificially intelligent technologies have become a common topic in our everyday discussions where arguments about the subject can take different forms from cognitive reasoning to emotional expressions. Utilizing persuasion theories and research on the appeal of content characteristics as the theoretical approach to examine affective-cognitive language, we investigated social media posts on artificial intelligence (AI). We examined Reddit posts from 2005 to 2018 referring to AI (N = 455,634) using automated content analysis tools. The results revealed that although both the tone positivity and affective-cognitive ratio were dependent on the specific context, the language in AI posts was more analytically than emotionally oriented in general. Other users were more likely to engage with Reddit posts on AI that were high in cognitive and analytic content compared to affective and emotional content. In addition to the practical contribution of public opinion on AI, the results contribute to the theoretical discussions on affective and cognitive language in social media discussions.

TI  - Governing Ethical AI Transformation: A Case Study of AuroraAI
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - How can the public sector use AI ethically and responsibly for the benefit of people? The sustainable development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector requires dialogue and deliberation between developers, decision makers, deployers, end users, and the public. This paper contributes to the debate on how to develop persuasive government approaches for steering the development and use of AI. We examine the ethical issues and the role of the public in the debate on developing public sector governance of socially and democratically sustainable and technology-intensive societies. To concretize this discussion, we study the co-development of a Finnish national AI program AuroraAI, which aims to provide citizens with tailored and timely services for different life situations, utilizing AI. With the help of this case study, we investigate the challenges posed by the development and use of AI in the service of public administration. We draw particular attention to the efforts made by the AuroraAI Ethics Board in deliberating the AuroraAI solution options and working toward a sustainable and inclusive AI society.

TI  - Deconstructing the role of artificial intelligence in programmatic advertising: at the intersection of automation and transparency
T2  - JOURNAL OF STRATEGIC MARKETING
AB  - With the increasingly sophisticated improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in marketing communications, a gap prevails between heightened levels of excitement around it and high-level application. Consequently, this topic necessitates in-depth investigation to prepare for future changes. This study examines the role of AI in programmatic advertising through a quantitative content analysis of AI-enabled digital programmatic advertisements. Although the idea that sponsorship disclosure, appeals, and sentiments are important in persuasive messages has been documented, this study extends existing literature by examining these concepts within AI-enabled programmatic advertising. Sponsorship-linked marketing and congruence theory guided this study. The results showed that only about half of the ads revealed sponsorship information. Further, the brand-sponsor association was not clearly established in the ads. A sentiment analysis showed the prominence of positive sentiments in the ads. Additionally, the ads mostly used product- and consumer-focused appeals. Theoretical and research contributions and strategic marketing implications are discussed.

TI  - Persuasion in the Age of Artificial Intelligence (AI): Theories and Complications of AI-Based Persuasion
T2  - HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has profound implications for both communication and persuasion. We consider how AI complicates and promotes rethinking of persuasion theory and research. We define AI-based persuasion as a symbolic process in which a communicative-AI entity generates, augments, or modifies a message-designed to convince people to shape, reinforce, or change their responses-that is transmitted to human receivers. We review theoretical perspectives useful for studying AI-based persuasion-the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model, and the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion-to explicate how differences in AI complicate persuasion in two ways. First, thin AI exhibits few (if any) machinic (i.e., AI) cues, social cues might be available, and communication is limited and indirect. Second, thick AI exhibits ample machinic and social cues, AI presence is obvious, and communication is direct and interactive. We suggest avenues for future research in each case.

TI  - Evaluating XAI: A comparison of rule-based and example-based explanations
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Current developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) led to a resurgence of Explainable AI (XAI). New methods are being researched to obtain information from AI systems in order to generate explanations for their output. However, there is an overall lack of valid and reliable evaluations of the effects on users' experience of, and behavior in response to explanations. New XAI methods are often based on an intuitive notion what an effective explanation should be. Ruleand example-based contrastive explanations are two exemplary explanation styles. In this study we evaluate the effects of these two explanation styles on system understanding, persuasive power and task performance in the context of decision support in diabetes self-management. Furthermore, we provide three sets of recommendations based on our experience designing this evaluation to help improve future evaluations. Our results show that rule-based explanations have a small positive effect on system understanding, whereas both ruleand example-based explanations seem to persuade users in following the advice even when incorrect. Neither explanation improves task performance compared to no explanation. This can be explained by the fact that both explanation styles only provide details relevant for a single decision, not the underlying rational or causality. These results show the importance of user evaluations in assessing the current assumptions and intuitions on effective explanations. (c) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Behavior Change Support Systems for Self-Treating Procrastination: Systematic Search in App Stores and Analysis of Motivational Design Archetypes
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: The phenomenon of procrastination refers to an individual's conscious decision to postpone the completion of tasks despite being aware of its adverse consequences in the future. Extant research in this field shows that procrastination is associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress and the likelihood of developing depression and calls for the development of suitable interventions that support individuals in making lasting positive changes to their procrastination behaviors. In parallel, practice has produced a plethora of behavior change support systems (BCSSs) that aim to provide a low-threshold, accessible alternative to in-person therapeutic approaches. Most of these BCSSs can be considered motivational BCSSs that combine functional, utilitarian components with hedonic and eudaimonic design elements to empower self-treatment. Although early studies have suggested the potential benefits of such BCSSs, research on understanding their specific design characteristics and support of individuals in self-treating procrastination is still in its infancy. Objective: In response to this gap between practice and research, we aimed to analyze and systemize the multitude of practical design efforts in motivational BCSSs for the self-treatment of procrastination and identify the main design archetypes that have emerged. Methods: We conducted a 3-step research approach. First, we identified 127 behavior change support apps for procrastination through a systematic screening process in theGerman and USAppleApp Store and Google Play Store. Second, we systematically coded the identified apps in terms of the behavior change techniques targeted by their functional design and hedonic or eudaimonic design elements. Third, we conducted a 2-step cluster analysis to identify archetypes of motivational design in behavior change support apps to combat procrastination. Results: A variety of motivational designs have been developed and implemented in practice, and our analysis identified five mainarchetypes: (1) structured progressmonitor, (2) self-improvementguide, (3) productivity adventure, (4) emotional wellness coach, and (5) social focus companion. The identified archetypes target different psychological determinants of procrastination and successfully use a variety of hedonic and eudaimonic design elements that extend beyond the current state of research. Conclusions:The results of our study provide a foundation for future research endeavors that aim to examine the comparative effects of motivational design archetypes and develop more effective interventions tailored to individual needs. For practitioners, the findings reveal the contemporary design space of motivational BCSSs to support the self-treatment of procrastination and may serve as blueprints that can guide the design of future systems. For individuals seeking support and health professionals treating procrastination, our study systemizes the landscape of apps, thereby facilitating the selection of one that best aligns with the patient's individual needs.

TI  - Nature of Users' Persuasion and Exploration in Interactive Storytelling Video Games in the Netflix Games Library
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - As trailblazer in streaming entertainment, Netflix has redefined how people consume media, captivating audiences with its original programming. Despite this, the streaming giant could not translate similar success with its video game offering. This paper is an outcome of a unique experimental study which examines the built-in features of interactive storytelling games and their effect on induced persuasion and exploration among game players. This research involves eighty- eight players playing two popular games from the Netflix library. It tests the effects of artificial intelligence, feature interactivity, device responsiveness and personalization features of the game on induced persuasion and exploration among gamers. Using Bayesian regression and correlation, the results help to deduce that while built-in features can effectively persuade players, they fall short in encouraging deeper exploration within the game's narrative. It also illustrates the growing significance of artificial intelligence in human computer interaction. The study also highlights the critical role of storytelling for the gaming business and its significance in developing new visual culture.

TI  - The connected workplace: Characteristics and social consequences of work surveillance in the age of datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence
T2  - JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Because of COVID-19 lockdowns, managers and administrators have begun to look for new ways to monitor and control their stranded-at-home workforce. Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee's body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance. Taking an employee-centric position, it also proposes a research agenda for critical, behavioral, and design-oriented scholars who wish to explore the identified issues.

T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Understanding human-artificial intelligence (AI) interactions is a growing academic interest. This article conceptualizes AI as a persuasion agent and reviews the recent literature on AI through the lens of persuasion knowledge. It presents research on AI acceptance and aversion in terms of the properties of the AI itself (e.g., anthropomorphism, functionality, and usability), the properties of individuals interacting with AI (e.g., individual differences in judgments of AI, perceived uniqueness, and task performance), and the context of the interaction (e.g., type of decision, domain, and usage occasion). In assessing AI interaction research through this lens, we systematically categorize these findings and identify promising future research directions.

TI  - SmileApp: The Design and Evaluation of an mHealth App for Stress Reduction Through Artificial Intelligence and Persuasive Technology
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY, PERSUASIVE 2024
CP  - 19th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - Mobile health apps are becoming popular and capable of addressing a wide range of health-related issues including stress. In this study, we designed, developed, and evaluated an mHealth application called SmileApp to promote positive mood as a means of reducing stress. The design of SmileApp is grounded in psychological theories and integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and persuasive technology (PT). To evaluate SmileApp, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study involving 72 participants. This was followed by an optional semi-structured interviewwith 23 participants. Quantitative results suggest that SmileApp is usable, and the use of the features can convince users to smile more frequently, as well as feel a sense of companionship and connectedness. Furthermore, qualitative results suggest that SmileApp was a unique design to help users alleviate stress. These results offer valuable insights into innovative approaches for designing mHealth applications that promote positive mood. Moreover, the findings underscore the importance of utilizing technology to support emotional wellbeing. We present a novel approach to promote desired behaviors by motivating users to read supportive messages and play mobile games by smiling.

TI  - A unified health algorithm that teaches itself to improve health outcomes for every individual: How far into the future is it?
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - The single biggest factor driving health outcomes is patient behavior. The CHR Model (County Health Rankings Model) weights socioeconomic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and physical environment factors collectively at 80% in driving impact on health outcomes, to the 20% weight for access to and quality of clinical care. Commercial determinants of health affect everyone today and unhealthy choices worsen pre-existing economic, social, and racial inequities. Yet there is a disproportionate focus on therapeutic intervention to the exclusion of shaping patient behaviors to improve healthcare. If the recent pandemic taught us a critically important lesson, it is the imperative to look beyond clinical care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), long-standing systemic health and social inequities put various groups of people at higher risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, including many racial and ethnic minority groups. The virus was simply more efficient in detecting such vulnerabilities than the guardians of these physiologies. These insights from the pandemic come at the heel of a confluence of three major accelerants that may radically reshape our approaches to hot-spotting vulnerabilities and managing them before they manifest in a derangement or disease. They are the recent strides in behavioral economics and behavior science; advances in remote monitoring and personal health technologies; and developments in artificial intelligence and data sciences. These accelerants allow us to imagine a previously impossible vision-we can now build and maintain a unified health algorithm for every individual that can dynamically track the two interdependent streams of risk, clinical and behavioral.

TI  - An Artificial Intelligence-Driven Digital Health Solution to Support Clinical Management of Patients With Long COVID-19: Protocol for a Prospective Multicenter Observational Study
T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the weaknesses of most health systems around the world, collapsing them and depleting their available health care resources. Fortunately, the development and enforcement of specific public health policies, such as vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, among others, has reduced the prevalence and complications associated with COVID-19 in its acute phase. However, the aftermath of the global pandemic has called for an efficient approach to manage patients with long COVID-19. This is a great opportunity to leverage on innovative digital health solutions to provide exhausted health care systems with the most cost-effective and efficient tools available to support the clinical management of this population. In this context, the SENSING-AI project is focused on the research toward the implementation of an artificial intelligence-driven digital health solution that supports both the adaptive self-management of people living with long COVID-19 and the health care staff in charge of the management and follow-up of this population.
   Objective: The objective of this protocol is the prospective collection of psychometric and biometric data from 10 patients for training algorithms and prediction models to complement the SENSING-AI cohort.
   Methods: Publicly available health and lifestyle data registries will be consulted and complemented with a retrospective cohort of anonymized data collected from clinical information of patients diagnosed with long COVID-19. Furthermore, a prospective patient-generated data set will be captured using wearable devices and validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaires to complement the retrospective cohort. Finally, the 'Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse' guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship will be applied to the resulting data set to encourage the continuous process of discovery, evaluation, and reuse of information for the research community at large.
   Results: The SENSING-AI cohort is expected to be completed during 2022. It is expected that sufficient data will be obtained to generate artificial intelligence models based on behavior change and mental well-being techniques to improve patients' self-management, while providing useful and timely clinical decision support services to health care professionals based on risk stratification models and early detection of exacerbations.
   Conclusions: SENSING-AI focuses on obtaining high-quality data of patients with long COVID-19 during their daily life. Supporting these patients is of paramount importance in the current pandemic situation, including supporting their health care professionals in a cost-effective and efficient management of long COVID-19.

TI  - A systematic literature review for understanding the effectiveness of advanced techniques in diabetes self-care management
T2  - ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB  - This article includes a systematic review that identifies and summarizes the many behavioral change techniques (BCTs), behavioral health theories, and advanced techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) currently used to manage diabetes. The review focuses on assessing the efficacy of diabetes self-care applications that leverage these cutting-edge techniques in their development and use. The study provides the latest comprehensive review and the findings of the report through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 reporting guidelines. After carefully reviewing and choosing pertinent studies from well-known bibliographic databases, the review finds that self-care treatments favor behavior change, blood glucose reduction, healthier habits, and substantial weight loss. According to the results, investigations that use these methodologies and ideas and AI-based ones are more likely to succeed. The evaluation ends by highlighting its shortcomings and outlining potential future research and application design areas. It also highlights the possibility of incorporating BCT methodologies, theories, and AI-based techniques in creating self-management interventions. The knowledge gained from this systematic review can help application developers create frameworks for effective diabetes self-care interventions based on the identified cutting-edge techniques.

TI  - Exploring VUI-Supported Mindfulness Techniques for Smoking Cessation
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH CONFERENCE ON ACM CONVERSATIONAL USER INTERFACES, CUI 2024
CP  - 6th ACM Conference on Conversational User Interfaces (CUI)
AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) in supporting mindfulness techniques for smoking cessation. We conducted a month-long between-subject study involving nine participants, comparing a VUI on smart speakers against an augmented VUI (a blend of VUI and Graphical User Interface) on mobile devices. Specifically, we evaluated how these interfaces support individuals in quitting smoking through mindfulness practices. Our results include qualitative insights on participants' experiences with mindfulness, their smoking cessation motivation, and engagement with the VUI prototypes, alongside quantitative data on their usage patterns. Our findings offer insights into the potential application of VUIs in smoking cessation and suggest design guidelines for future health-oriented applications. The study underscores the importance of device context in designing effective health interventions and sets the direction for future work in HCI and mindfulness applications.

TI  - Digital therapeutics in hypertension: How to make sustainable lifestyle changes
T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL HYPERTENSION
AB  - Various digital therapeutic products have been validated and approved since 2017. They have demonstrated efficacy and safety as a new therapeutic modality in various disorders or conditions. Hypertension is a common but serious condition that can be prevented or controlled with lifestyle changes and medicines. Although a digital therapeutic in hypertension is validated and approved in Japan, whether digital therapeutics (DTx) can significantly improve sustainable lifestyle changes is still a controversial topic. Most studies did not discuss the long-term gain challenges. In this review, the authors discuss the definition of DTx, and analyze the motivation, engagement and adherence challenges of DTx in hypertension. Some ongoing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based digital interventions and behavioral strategies for implementing sustainable lifestyle changes are identified and analyzed. With AI-enabled interventions and behavioral strategies, DTx might be one of the effective approaches to make sustainable lifestyle changes.

TI  - Digital Transformation Based on AI Technologies in European Union Organizations
T2  - ELECTRONICS
AB  - This study aims to investigate the influence of emerging digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, on the digital intensity index (DII). The research method employed involves quantitative analysis of the indicators regarding DII and emerging digital technologies, conducted based on data published by Eurostat for EU members in 2021. During our research, we formulated and tested hypotheses about the relationship between the DII and emerging digital technologies, and the effect on the DII of using AI-based technologies in various economic processes. The formulated hypotheses were validated via four regression models designed during this study, using the most relevant factors. Our research results demonstrate that the DII is positively influenced by emerging IoT and cloud computing digital technologies, as well as the use of AI technologies based on machine learning and AI-based robotic process automation (RPA) software. Furthermore, the same positive influence was identified in human resource management and recruitment processes compared to the intensity with which these technologies are used in other economic processes. Based on these findings, this study offers persuasive arguments for implementing emerging digital technologies at the EU organizational level to achieve significant increases in digitalization levels.

TI  - Designing a feature selection method based on explainable artificial intelligence
T2  - ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB  - Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) systems make predictions in numerous high stakes domains, including credit-risk assessment and medical diagnostics. Consequently, AI systems increasingly affect humans, yet many state-of-the-art systems lack transparency and thus, deny the individual's "right to explanation ". As a remedy, researchers and practitioners have developed explainable AI, which provides reasoning on how AI systems infer individual predictions. However, with recent legal initiatives demanding comprehensive explainability throughout the (development of an) AI system, we argue that the pre-processing stage has been unjustifiably neglected and should receive greater attention in current efforts to establish explainability. In this paper, we focus on introducing explainability to an integral part of the pre-processing stage: feature selection. Specifically, we build upon design science research to develop a design framework for explainable feature selection. We instantiate the design framework in a running software artifact and evaluate it in two focus group sessions. Our artifact helps organizations to persuasively justify feature selection to stakeholders and, thus, comply with upcoming AI legislation. We further provide researchers and practitioners with a design framework consisting of meta-requirements and design principles for explainable feature selection.

TI  - Understanding the emotional response to Covid-19 information in news and social media: A mental health perspective
T2  - HUMAN BEHAVIOR AND EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions has been profound, affecting the health, livelihoods, and wellbeing of populations worldwide. Studies have shown widespread effects on mental health, with an increase in stress, loneliness, and depression symptoms related to the pandemic. Media plays a critical role in containing and managing crises, by informing society and fostering positive behavior change. Social restrictions have led to a large increase in reliance on online media channels, and this can influence mental health and wellbeing. Anxiety levels, for instance, may be exacerbated by exposure to Covid-related content, contagion of negative sentiment among social networks, and "fake news." In some cases, this may trigger abstinence, leading to isolation and limited access to vital information. To be able to communicate distressing news during crises while protecting the wellbeing of individuals is not trivial; it requires a deeper understanding of people's emotional response to online and social media content. This paper selectively reviews research into consequences of social media usage and online news consumption for wellbeing and mental health, focusing on and discussing their effects in the context of the pandemic. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, for example, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Recognition, are discussed as useful methods for investigating effects on population mental health as the pandemic situation evolves. We present suggestions for future research, and for using these advances to assess large data sets of users' online content, to potentially inform strategies that enhance the mental health of social media users going forward.

TI  - A Blueprint for an AI & AR-Based Eye Tracking System to Train Cardiology Professionals Better Interpret Electrocardiograms
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2022)
CP  - 17th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - The electrocardiogram is one of the most used medical tests worldwide. Despite its prevalent use in the healthcare sector, there exists a limited understanding in how medical practitioners interpret it. This is mainly due to the scarcity of international guidelines that unify its interpretation across different health institutions. This leads to a lack of training and unpreparedness by medical students who are about to join the medical workforce. In this paper, we propose a blueprint for a proactive artificial intelligence and augmented reality-based eye tracking system to train cardiology professionals for a better electrocardiogram interpretation. The proposed blueprint is inspired from extensive interviews with cardiology medical practitioners as well as students who interpret electro-cardiograms as part of their daily practice. The interviews contributed to identifying the major pain-points within the process of electrocardiogram interpretation. The interviews were also critical in conceptualizing the persuasive components of the training system for a guided correct electrocardiogram interpretation. Throughout the presented blueprint, we detail the three components that constitute the system. These are the augmented reality-based interactive training interface, the artificial intelligence-based processing sub-system, and finally the adaptive electrocardiogram dataset.

TI  - Gamification of Behavior Change: Mathematical Principle and Proof-of-Concept Study
T2  - JMIR SERIOUS GAMES
AB  - Background: Many people want to build good habits to become healthier, live longer, or become happier but struggle to change their behavior. Gamification can make behavior change easier by awarding points for the desired behavior and deducting points for its omission. Objective: In this study, we introduced a principled mathematical method for determining how many points should be awarded or deducted for the enactment or omission of the desired behavior, depending on when and how often the person has succeeded versus failed to enact it in the past. We called this approach optimized gamification of behavior change. Methods: As a proof of concept, we designed a chatbot that applies our optimized gamification method to help people build healthy water -drinking habits. We evaluated the effectiveness of this gamified intervention in a 40 -day field experiment with 1 experimental group (n=43) that used the chatbot with optimized gamification and 2 active control groups for which the chatbot's optimized gamification feature was disabled. For the first control group (n=48), all other features were available, including verbal feedback. The second control group (n=51) received no feedback or reminders. We measured the strength of all participants' water -drinking habits before, during, and after the intervention using the Self -Report Habit Index and by asking participants on how many days of the previous week they enacted the desired habit. In addition, all participants provided daily reports on whether they enacted their water -drinking intention that day. Results: A Poisson regression analysis revealed that, during the intervention, users who received feedback based on optimized gamification enacted the desired behavior more often (mean 14.71, SD 6.57 times) than the active (mean 11.64, SD 6.38 times; P<.001; incidence rate ratio=0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.91) or passive (mean 11.64, SD 5.43 times; P=.001; incidence rate ratio=0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.89) control groups. The Self -Report Habit Index score significantly increased in all conditions (P<.001 in all cases) but did not differ between the experimental and control conditions (P>.11 in all cases). After the intervention, the experimental group performed the desired behavior as often as the 2 control groups (P >=.17 in all cases). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that optimized gamification can be used to make digital behavior change interventions more effective.

TI  - Navigating healthier beverage consumption in adolescents using the "R-Ma Bot" chatbot: A usability and evaluation study
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective This pilot study aimed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of a behavior change technique (BCT)-based chatbot developed to promote healthier beverage consumption among adolescents.Methods The Read and Manage your health roBot ("R-Ma Bot"), designed with 13 BCTs, was tested with 42 adolescents (13 men, 29 women, mean age 15.0 +/- 0.7) for 2 weeks. Usability was assessed after the 2-week intervention using a chatbot usability questionnaire, recruitment, retention, participation, and engagement. Scores above 70 out of 100 were considered high usability. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were collected for evaluation. Effectiveness was measured by changes in knowledge, use and impact of nutrition labels, and weekly consumption of sugar, sodium, and caffeine from carbonated and/or energy drinks before and after the 2-week intervention.Results The score of R-Ma Bot's usability averaged 74.7, with participants addressing it useful, friendly, and easy to use, though they suggested improving unnatural conversation flow. All participants engaged with the chatbot for at least 13 out of 14 days, with over half using it daily for the entire period. After intervention, awareness of nutrition labels increased from 64.3% to 92.9%, and nonreaders decreased from 42.9% to 16.7%. Weekly sugar intake from beverages significantly decreased by 60%, from 13.1 +/- 20.1 mg to 7.9 +/- 12.8 mg.Conclusions R-Ma Bot's high usability contributed to high retention and behavioral changes, significantly reduced sugar consumption from beverages and improved awareness of nutrition labels. We suggest integrating strategies that enhance knowledge, motivation, and opportunities through BCTs with youth-friendly design elements in the development of interventions for adolescents.

TI  - Types of Dialogue and Burdens of Proof
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF ARGUMENT: PROCEEDINGS OF COMMA 2010
CP  - 3rd Conference on Computational Models of Argument
AB  - Burden of proof has recently come to be a topic of interest in argumentation systems for artificial intelligence (Prakken and Sartor, 2006, 2007, 2009; Gordon and Walton, 2007, 2009), but so far the main work on the subject seems to be in that type of dialogue which has most intensively been investigated generally, namely persuasion dialogue. The most significant exception is probably deliberation dialogue, where some recent work has begun to tentatively investigate burden of proof in that setting. In this paper, I survey work on burden of proof in the artificial intelligence literature on argumentation, and offer some thoughts on how this work might be extended to the other types of dialogue recognized by Walton and Krabbe (1995) that so far do not appear to have been much investigated in this regard.

TI  - A Comprehensive Study of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Approaches in Confronting the Coronavirus (COVID-19) Pandemic
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH SERVICES
AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread over 219 countries of the globe as a pandemic, creating alarming impacts on health care, socioeconomic environments, and international relationships. The principal objective of the study is to provide the current technological aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and other relevant technologies and their implications for confronting COVID-19 and preventing the pandemic's dreadful effects. This article presents AI approaches that have significant contributions in the fields of health care, then highlights and categorizes their applications in confronting COVID-19, such as detection and diagnosis, data analysis and treatment procedures, research and drug development, social control and services, and the prediction of outbreaks. The study addresses the link between the technologies and the epidemics as well as the potential impacts of technology in health care with the introduction of machine learning and natural language processing tools. It is expected that this comprehensive study will support researchers in modeling health care systems and drive further studies in advanced technologies. Finally, we propose future directions in research and conclude that persuasive AI strategies, probabilistic models, and supervised learning are required to tackle future pandemic challenges.

TI  - Barriers and facilitators to physical activity and further digital exercise intervention among inactive British adolescents in secondary schools: a qualitative study with physical education teachers
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - BackgroundPrevious studies indicated that physical education programs in schools were unsuccessful to ameliorate physical activity (PA) behaviors among adolescents. This study investigated PE teachers' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to PA and further digital exercise interventions among inactive British adolescents in secondary schools based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model, the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW), and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). MethodA qualitative study was conducted among 156 PE teachers in England. deductive thematic analysis approach was applied to analyze data. ResultsA comprehensive perception of PE teachers revealed 21 barriers to PA among inactive adolescents in secondary schools. The study findings show that barriers exist across all categories of the COM-B model in physical opportunity (7), reflective motivation (5), social opportunity (4), psychological capability (4) and physical capability (1). The majority of these barriers were reported in previous studies as being barriers to PA from the perspective of children and adolescents. This shows that the findings are consistent with the views of children and adolescents that participated in these studies. Particular salient barriers for inactive adolescents were reported and greater insight into their experiences was highlighted. The study reported the main sources of behavior, intervention functions, policy functions, and behavior change tools that can be used for future behavior change interventions to support inactive adolescents. ConclusionThe study recommends using its findings to design interventions for inactive adolescents to achieve recommended levels of physical activity (PA). The study's comprehensive approach and evidence-based solutions provide extensive reference points for future intervention design, informing policy and contributing to enhancing support for inactive adolescents. Further development of digital exercise interventions, including conversational artificial intelligence (AI), is suggested to engage adolescents at scale and provide personalized support to overcome multiple barriers to PA.

TI  - A Theory-Driven Approach to Fake News/Information Disorder Analysis and Explanation via Target-Based Emotion-Stance Analysis (TESA) and Interpretive Graph Generation (IGG)
T2  - SOCIAL SCIENCE COMPUTER REVIEW
AB  - Information disorder (IDO) presents a persistent challenge to society, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding its dynamics beyond just merely detecting it. This study introduces a theory-driven framework that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning, utilizing the target-based emotion-stance analysis (TESA) approach to analyze emotion and stance dynamics within IDO content. Complementing TESA, interactive graph generation (IGG) is applied for scalable and interpretable qualitative analyses. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study leverages TESA for target-centric emotion and stance analysis, evaluating target-based classifiers on both human-annotated and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the study explores synthetic data generation using generative AI to enrich the analysis, applying IGG to map complex data interactions. The study also found that integrating synthetic data developed from human annotations enhanced model performance, particularly for emotion classification tasks. Results demonstrate that IDO narratives significantly differ from non-IDO narratives, frequently leveraging negative emotions such as anger and disgust to manipulate public perception. TESA proved effective in capturing these nuanced variations, while IGG facilitated the triangulation of such findings via the scalable interpretation of emotional narratives, revealing that IDO content often amplifies polarizing and antagonistic perspectives. By combining TESA and IGG, this research emphasizes the importance of using NLP to extract and examine the emotional and stance nuances toward targets of interest within IDO context. This approach not only deepens theoretical insights into IDO's persuasive mechanisms but also supports the development of practical tools for analyzing and managing the influence of IDO on public discourse.

TI  - Exploring Persuasive Games for Emotion Regulation: A State-of-the-Art Scoping Review
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - Persuasive games, designed and tailored to change users' behavior, have enhanced user experience across various domains. However, their role in emotion regulation remains understudied, despite the increasingly immersive environments they create that trigger emotional responses. Sensors have emerged as key artificial intelligence (AI) tools in persuasive games supporting emotion regulation compared to other AI technologies, such as chatbots. Yet the effectiveness, challenges, and applications of these sensors lack comprehensive exploration. Our scoping review analyzed 32 articles published from 2013 to 2023 on persuasive games using AI-based sensing technologies for emotion regulation. Results from 27 articles (84.8%) reporting the effectiveness of sensors revealed mostly large to moderate effects (d >= 0.8 <= 0.4). Common challenges with integrated sensors (camera systems, facial recognition, smartwatches, and altimetric pressure sensors) included emotion detection accuracy and ethical concerns. We provide design recommendations for developing ethically sound and effective persuasive games for emotion regulation in the future.

TI  - Development of a Living Lab for a Mobile-Based Health Program for Korean-Chinese Working Women in South Korea: Mixed Methods Study
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Korean-Chinese (KC) women make up the largest group of female migrants in South Korea. To prevent and manage chronic diseases in middle-aged KC women working full time, it is necessary to develop health promotion programs that utilize an online platform because such a platform would allow individuals to participate in health promotion interventions at their convenience.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop a living lab for a mobile-based health (LLm Health) program focused on improving the physical activity and cultural adaptation of KC women workers.
   Methods: We used a mixed methods design. Living lab principles were factored into the LLm Health program, including the use of multiple methods, user engagement, multistakeholder participants, real-life settings, and cocreation. The program was developed using the 4 steps of the intervention mapping method: needs assessment, setting of objectives, identification of intervention strategies, and intervention design. Needs assessment was conducted through a literature review, focus group interviews with a total of 16 middle-aged KC women, and an online survey related to health promotion of migrant workers given to 38 stakeholders. KC middle-aged women participated in the early stages of program development and provided the idea of developing programs and mobile apps to enhance physical activity and acculturation. The mobile app developed in the program was validated with the help of 12 KC women and 4 experts, including 3 nursing professors and a professor of physical education. They were asked to rate each item based on content, interface design, and technology on a 4-point scale using a 23-item Smartphone App Evaluation Tool for Health Care.
   Results: The LLm Health program comprised a 24-week walking program using Fitbit devices, the mobile app, and social cognitive interventions. The mobile app contained 6 components: a step counter, an exercise timer, an online chat function, health information, level of cardiovascular risk, and health status. The cultural aspects and lifestyles of KC women were accommodated in the entire process of program development. The content validity of the mobile app was found to be 0.90 and 0.96 according to the 12 KC women and 4 experts, respectively.
   Conclusions: The mobile app was found to be valid and acceptable for KC women. The living lab approach was a useful strategy for developing a culturally adaptive LLm Health program for KC women workers, leading to their active participation in the overall research process, including needs assessment, program composition, and pre-evaluation.

TI  - Health recommender systems to facilitate collaborative decision-making in chronic disease management: A scoping review
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective Health recommender systems (HRSs) are increasingly used to complement existing clinical decision-making processes, but their use for chronic diseases remains underexplored. Recognizing the importance of collaborative decision making (CDM) and patient engagement in chronic disease treatment, this review explored how HRSs support patients in managing their illness.Methods A scoping review was conducted using the framework proposed by Arksey and O'Malley, advanced by Levac et al., in line with the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Quantitative (descriptive numerical summary) and qualitative (inductive content analysis) methods wered used to synthesize the data.Results Forty-five articles were included in the final review, most commonly covering diabetes (9/45, 20%), mental health (9/45, 20.0%), and tobacco dependence (7/45, 15.6%). Behavior change theories (10/45, 22.2%) and authoritative sources (10/45, 22.2%) were the most commonly referenced sources for design and development work. From the thematic analysis, we conclude: (a) the main goal of HRSs is to induce behavior change, but limited research investigates their effectiveness in achieving this aim; (b) studies acknowledge that theories, models, frameworks, and/or guidelines help design HRSs to elicit specific behavior change, but they do not implement them; (c) connections between CDM and HRS purpose should be more explicit; and (d) HRSs can often offer other self-management services, such as progress tracking and chatbots.Conclusions We recommend a greater emphasis on evaluation outcomes beyond algorithmic performance to determine HRS effectiveness and the creation of an evidence-driven, methodological approach to creating HRSs to optimize their use in enhancing patient care.Lay summary Our work aims to provide a summary of the current landscape of health recommender system (HRS) use for chronic disease management. HRSs are digital tools designed to help people manage their health by providing personalized recommendations based on their health history, behaviors, and preferences, enabling them to make more informed health decisions. Given the increased use of these tools for personalized care, and especially with advancements in generative artificial intelligence, understanding the current methods and evaluation processes used is integral to optimizing their effectiveness. Our findings show that HRSs are most used for diabetes, mental health, and tobacco dependence, but only a small percentage of publications directly reference and/or use relevant frameworks to help guide their design and evaluation processes. Furthermore, the goal for most of these HRSs is to induce behavior change, but there is limited research investigating how effective they are in accomplishing this. Given these findings, we recommend that evaluations shift their focus from algorithms to more holistic approaches and to be more intentional about the processes used when designing the tool to support an evidence-driven approach and ultimately create more effective and useful HRSs for chronic disease management.

TI  - Enhancing Trust and Empathy in Marketing: Strategic AI and Human Influencer Selection for Optimized Content Persuasion
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR
AB  - Compared to human influencers, AI influencers offer advantages such as low cost, high efficiency, and fairer handling of objective tasks. However, they are believed to have shortcomings in perception and empathy abilities. How can companies select the more appropriate promoter between AI influencers and human influencers based on their marketing content? How can enterprises design more persuasive marketing content according to the type of influencer? Three behavioral experiments were conducted in this paper. The results indicate that when AI influencers post marketing content with functional advertising appeal, they can significantly enhance people's perceived trust. When human influencers share marketing content with experiential advertising appeal, they can significantly improve people's perceived empathy. Consumers with lower levels of knowledge are more susceptible to the matching effect of influencer type and advertising appeal type on the persuasive effect of marketing content than those with higher levels of knowledge. The conclusions of this study assist enterprises in scientifically matching influencer types with advertising appeals. By choosing influencers based on the nature of the marketing content or designing suitable marketing content based on the influencer type, companies can maximize marketing effectiveness. This refined marketing strategy not only improves the persuasive effect of the marketing content but also strengthens the brand's market competitiveness.

TI  - The influence of algorithms on political and dating decisions
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Artificial intelligence algorithms are ubiquitous in daily life, and this is motivating the development of some institutional initiatives to ensure trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there is not enough research on how these algorithms can influence people's decisions and attitudes. The present research examines whether algorithms can persuade people, explicitly or covertly, on whom to vote and date, or whether, by contrast, people would reject their influence in an attempt to confirm their personal freedom and independence. In four experiments, we found that persuasion was possible and that different styles of persuasion (e.g., explicit, covert) were more effective depending on the decision context (e.g., political and dating). We conclude that it is important to educate people against trusting and following the advice of algorithms blindly. A discussion on who owns and can use the data that makes these algorithms work efficiently is also necessary.

TI  - Weight loss in a digital app-based diabetes prevention program powered by artificial intelligence
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Objective The National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) reduces diabetes incidence and associated medical costs but is typically staffing-intensive, limiting scalability. We evaluated an alternative delivery method with 3933 members of a program powered by conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) called Lark DPP that has full recognition from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods We compared weight loss maintenance at 12 months between two groups: 1) CDC qualifiers who completed >= 4 educational lessons over 9 months (n = 191) and 2) non-qualifiers who did not complete the required CDC lessons but provided weigh-ins at 12 months (n = 223). For a secondary aim, we removed the requirement for a 12-month weight and used logistic regression to investigate predictors of weight nadir in 3148 members. Results CDC qualifiers maintained greater weight loss at 12 months than non-qualifiers (M = 5.3%, SE = .8 vs. M = 3.3%, SE = .8; p = .015), with 40% achieving >= 5%. The weight nadir of 3148 members was 4.2% (SE = .1), with 35% achieving >= 5%. Male sex (beta = .11; P = .009), weeks with >= 2 weigh-ins (beta = .68; P < .0001), and days with an AI-powered coaching exchange (beta = .43; P < .0001) were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving >= 5% weight loss. Conclusions An AI-powered DPP facilitated weight loss and maintenance commensurate with outcomes of other digital and in-person programs not powered by AI. Beyond CDC lesson completion, engaging with AI coaching and frequent weighing increased the likelihood of achieving >= 5% weight loss. An AI-powered program is an effective method to deliver the DPP in a scalable, resource-efficient manner to keep pace with the prediabetes epidemic.

TI  - Leveraging Mobile Phone Sensors, Machine Learning, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence to Predict Imminent Same-Day Binge-drinking Events to Support Just-in-time Adaptive Interventions: Algorithm Development and Validation Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Digital just-in-time adaptive interventions can reduce binge-drinking events (BDEs; consuming >= 4 drinks for women and >= 5 drinks for men per occasion) in young adults but need to be optimized for timing and content. Delivering just-in-time support messages in the hours prior to BDEs could improve intervention impact.Objective: We aimed to determine the feasibility of developing a machine learning (ML) model to accurately predict future, that is, same-day BDEs 1 to 6 hours prior BDEs, using smartphone sensor data and to identify the most informative phone sensor features associated with BDEs on weekends and weekdays to determine the key features that explain prediction model performance.Methods: We collected phone sensor data from 75 young adults (aged 21 to 25 years; mean 22.4, SD 1.9 years) with risky drinking behavior who reported their drinking behavior over 14 weeks. The participants in this secondary analysis were enrolled in a clinical trial. We developed ML models testing different algorithms (eg, extreme gradient boosting [XGBoost] and decision tree) to predict same-day BDEs (vs low-risk drinking events and non-drinking periods) using smartphone sensor data (eg, accelerometer and GPS). We tested various "prediction distance" time windows (more proximal: 1 hour; distant: 6 hours) from drinking onset. We also tested various analysis time windows (ie, the amount of data to be analyzed), ranging from 1 to 12 hours prior to drinking onset, because this determines the amount of data that needs to be stored on the phone to compute the model. Explainable artificial intelligence was used to explore interactions among the most informative phone sensor features contributing to the prediction of BDEs.Results: The XGBoost model performed the best in predicting imminent same-day BDEs, with 95% accuracy on weekends and 94.3% accuracy on weekdays (F1-score=0.95 and 0.94, respectively). This XGBoost model needed 12 and 9 hours of phone sensor data at 3-and 6-hour prediction distance from the onset of drinking on weekends and weekdays, respectively, prior to predicting same-day BDEs. The most informative phone sensor features for BDE prediction were time (eg, time of day) and GPS-derived features, such as the radius of gyration (an indicator of travel). Interactions among key features (eg, time of day and GPS-derived features) contributed to the prediction of same-day BDEs. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility and potential use of smartphone sensor data and ML for accurately predicting imminent (same-day) BDEs in young adults. The prediction model provides "windows of opportunity," and with the adoptionof explainable artificial intelligence, we identified "key contributing features" to trigger just-in-time adaptive intervention prior to the onset of BDEs, which has the potential to reduce the likelihood of BDEs in young adults.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT02918565; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02918565

TI  - Beyond Consumption-Relevant Outcomes: The Role of AI Customer Service Chatbots' Communication Styles in Promoting Societal Welfare
T2  - JOURNAL OF SYSTEMS SCIENCE AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in customer service becomes ubiquitous. In response to the advocacy in the "2021 Coordinated Plan on Artificial Intelligence", it is crucial to understand how to leverage AI customer service chatbots for societal welfare. Across two scenario studies and one lab experiment, this research investigates the impact of AI chatbots' communication styles on consumers' subsequent prosocial intentions irrelevant to the AI-human interaction contents. The combined evidence suggests that consumers exhibit higher prosocial intentions after interacting with social-oriented (vs. task-oriented) AI chatbots. The findings reveal the chain-mediating roles of social presence and empathy. Moreover, the current research investigates the boundary effect of consumers' goal focus (process focus vs. outcome focus), and shows that AI chatbots' communication styles have stronger impact on prosocial intentions for customers with outcome focus. These results revealed the important externality of the AI application in marketplace and provide a novel perspective for companies to implement the corporate social responsibility (CSR) strategy.

TI  - Clicks and tricks: The dark art of online persuasion
T2  - CURRENT OPINION IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Internet users are inundated with attempts to persuade, including digital nudges like defaults, friction, and reinforcement. When these nudges fail to be transparent, optional, and beneficial, they can become 'dark patterns', categorised here under the acronym FORCES (Frame, Obstruct, Ruse, Compel, Entangle, Seduce). Elsewhere, psychological principles like negativity bias, the curiosity gap, and fluency are exploited to make social content viral, while more covert tactics including astroturfing, meta-nudging, and inoculation are used to manufacture consensus. The power of these techniques is set to increase in line with technological advances such as predictive algorithms, generative AI, and virtual reality. Digital nudges can be used for altruistic purposes including protection against manipulation, but behavioural interventions have mixed effects at best.

TI  - RETRACTED: Beliefs and Practice Evaluation Based on Artificial Intelligence Models under the IP Environment (Retracted Article)
T2  - JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - The digitization of thought theory is not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the students. It is very necessary to strengthen the construction of ideological and political (IP) courses, strengthen the education of mainstream ideology, and occupy the initiative of discourse. There are effective ways and means to study the deep integration of information technologies into the new age of philosophy and philosophy education of students, which can greatly improve the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of humanities courses. The intuitive development of intellectual and political education through artificial intelligence is both a real prerequisite for modern development and technological innovation and for new ideas confronting the specific problems of thought-politics education, and it is a necessary prerequisite to ensure the quality and efficiency to improve the teaching of thought politics. AI in ways that embed technology provides a powerful impetus for contradictory movements in thought-politics discourse that lead the effective coordination of its internal elements to high-quality developments. In a practical way, we should take full advantage of the technical advantages of artificial intelligence, through intelligent mehrfachanalyse corresponding algorithms, artificial intelligenzbilder, and artificial roboterbilder photos and profiles that are used to write and accurately provide more precise, leading, stacking, and accurate estimates to maximize and to improve the accuracy of thought and policy education. Philosophy and political theory are the keys to guiding people to accomplish basic human tasks. With the passage of time and with continuous innovation, ideology and philosophical principles are both prerequisites for the self-development of the emotions of the age and necessary for improving the outcomes and effectiveness of scientific education. Advances in the field of artificial intelligence have fundamentally changed human life and have also impacted traditional school and university education systems. This brings new opportunities and challenges to students. This includes the use of smart technology to improve the learning process. Ideological teachers and policymakers must keep up with the all-round trend of the times, make full use of the benefits brought by intelligent new technologies and platforms, effectively improve the effect of ideological education, and further increase the attractiveness, attraction, persuasion, and contagion of ideological education.

TI  - Measuring adherence, acceptability and likability of an artificial-intelligence-based, gamified phone application to improve the quality of dietary choices of adolescents in Ghana and Vietnam: Protocol of a randomized controlled pilot test
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Unhealthy diets are a critical global concern while dietary measure methods are time consuming and expensive. There is limited evidence that phone-based interventions can improve nutrition data collection and dietary quality, especially for adolescents in developing countries. We developed an artificial-intelligence-based phone application called Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights (FRANI) to address these problems. FRANI can recognize foods in images, track food consumption, display statistics and use gamified nudges to give positive feedback on healthy food choice. This study protocol describes the design of new pilot studies aimed at measuring the feasibility (acceptability, adherence, and usability) of FRANI and its effects on the quality of food choice of adolescents in Ghana and Vietnam. In each country, 36 adolescents (12-18 years) will be randomly allocated into two groups: The intervention group with the full version of FRANI and the control group with the functionality limited to image recognition and dietary assessment. Participants in both groups will have their food choices tracked for four weeks. The control groups will then switch to the full version of FRANI and both groups will be tracked for a further 2 weeks to assess acceptability, adherence, and usability. Analysis of outcomes will be by intent to treat and differences in outcomes between intervention and control group will use Poisson and odds ratio regression models, accounting for repeated measures at individual levels. If deemed feasible, acceptable and usable, FRANI will address gaps in the literature and advance the nutrition field by potentially improving the quality of food choices of adolescent girls in developing countries. This pilot study will also provide insights on the design of a large randomized controlled trial. The functioning and dissemination of FRANI can be an important step towards highly scalable nutrition data collection and healthier food choices for a population at risk of malnutrition.
   The study protocol and the methods and materials were approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the IFPRI on April 29th, 2020 (registration number #00007490), the Thai Nguyen National Hospital on April 14th, 2020 ( protocol code 274/DDD-BVTWTN) and the University of Ghana on August 10th, 2020 (Federalwide Assurance FWA 00001824; NMIMR-IRB CPN 078-19/20). The study protocol was registered in the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN 10681553; https://doi.org/10.1186/ISRCTN10681553) on November 12, 2021.

TI  - Minding the source: toward an integrative theory of human-machine communication
T2  - HUMAN COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB  - According to the computers are social actors (CASA) paradigm, a dominant theoretical framework for research on human-computer interaction, people treat computers as if they were people. Recent studies on human-machine communication (HMC) and human-artificial intelligence (AI) interaction, however, appear to focus on when and how people respond to machines differently than to human agents. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, this study reviews critically the two overarching theoretical explanations proposed and tested in each respective tradition, the mindlessness account and the machine heuristic. After elaborating on several conceptual and operational issues with each explanatory mechanism, an alternative theoretical model of HMC is proposed that integrates both research traditions and generates predictions that potentially deviate from the dual-process models. Lastly, it is discussed how recent developments in AI technology invite modifications to the current understanding of HMC and beyond.

TI  - Stimulating or Intimidating: The Effect of AI-Enabled In-Store Communication on Consumer Patronage Likelihood
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has penetrated the marketing landscape and is having a profound impact on businesses' communication strategies. With AI coming under the spotlight, we know surprisingly little about its impact on consumers' patronage likelihood. This research attempts to address this void by investigating the "just-walk-out" retail technology in cohort with in-store communication. Across three studies, conducted online and in the field, the authors demonstrate that, compared to self-service checkouts, AI-enabled checkouts lead to significantly higher consumers' patronage likelihood. Furthermore, sensory stimulation stemming from in-store communication (environmental cues including assortment, advertising, and technology) underlies this impact. Importantly, the extent to which consumers perceive AI technology to be threatening is revealed as a boundary condition to these effects. These findings advance our understanding of how AI-enabled checkouts and in-store communication influence consumers' patronage likelihood and the boundary condition that moderates their impact.

T2  - CHASQUI-REVISTA LATINOAMERICANA DE COMUNICACION
AB  - Connective life has accelerated since 2020, when the covid-19 pandemic began, which contributed to intensify some digitization processes that have been underway for decades. This connective life also presents new challenges, such as surveillance capitalism, the attention economy, and contingent intellects, formed by powerful persuasive algorithms. In this context, the 147th edition of Chasqui is proposed as an Ibero-American transnational digital culture observatory. To do this, we have selected 10 articles that reveal significant networks, and in which user behaviors are studied; Ibero-American habits, uses and customs are mapped on social networks; Forms of organization in the consumption, production and circulation of content are described; techniques and content used to manipulate information and opinion are analyzed; describe and identify themselves in ways of spreading false news and hate speech; and new theoretical proposals are presented to understand Latin America through the analysis and reading of fields such as big data, machine learning, Artificial Intelligence, algorithms, or data analysis and visualization systems.

TI  - Ambient Engineering: Hyper-Nudging, Hyper-Relevance, and Rhetorics of Nearness and Farness in a Post-AI Algorithmic World
T2  - RHETORIC SOCIETY QUARTERLY
AB  - This essay argues that algorithms and artificial intelligence (AI) are producing a transformation in the economics of attention. Attention is a limited concept, a point I demonstrate by providing a phenomenological understanding of attending via Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty, specifically showing the usefulness of the existential and platial concepts of nearness and farness. Emerging, AI-driven techniques of hyper-nudging and hyper-relevance address themselves to our senses of nearness and farness. Hyper-relevance is particularly significant as it is proleptic in trying to anticipate concernful engagement, without directly soliciting it, by transforming the conditions of possibility for modes of attending. I call such techniques ambient engineering, which are concerned with transforming the conditions for producing salience. Ambient engineering has consequences for rhetorical practice and theory, including greater focus on subattentive engagements, and thus also an elision of more traditional forms of suasion.

TI  - Illusory Arguments by Artificial Agents: Pernicious Legacy of the Sophists
T2  - HUMANITIES-BASEL
AB  - To diagnose someone's reasoning today as "sophistry" is to say that this reasoning is at once persuasive (at least to a significant degree) and logically invalid. We begin by explaining that, despite some recent scholarly arguments to the contrary, the understanding of 'sophistry' and 'sophistic' underlying such a lay diagnosis is in fact firmly in line with the hallmarks of reasoning proffered by the ancient sophists themselves. Next, we supply a rigorous but readable definition of what constitutes sophistic reasoning (=sophistry). We then discuss "artificial" sophistry: the articulation of sophistic reasoning facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and promulgated in our increasingly digital world. Next, we present, economically, a particular kind of artificial sophistry, one embodied by an artificial agent: the lying machine. Afterward, we respond to some anticipated objections. We end with a few speculative thoughts about the limits (or lack thereof) of artificial sophistry, and what may be a rather dark future.

TI  - Is artificial intelligence more persuasive than humans? A meta-analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - The rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled AI agents to take on various roles as communicators, such as virtual assistants, robot journalists, and AI doctors. This study meta-analyzed 121 randomized experimental studies (N = 53,977) that compared the effects of AI and human agency on persuasion outcomes, including perceptions, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. The results showed that AI agents were as persuasive as humans in terms of overall persuasion outcomes. With regard to different types of outcomes, AI was less effective than humans at shaping behavioral intentions, but did not differ significantly from humans in eliciting perceptions, attitudes, or actual behaviors. Additionally, heterogeneous patterns were observed for different roles of AI communicators, directions of communication, experimental settings, and demographic segments. The implications of these findings for human-machine communication and persuasion in the era of AI are discussed.

TI  - Argumentation and explainable artificial intelligence: a survey
T2  - KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
AB  - Argumentation and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) are closely related, as in the recent years, Argumentation has been used for providing Explainability to AI. Argumentation can show step by step how an AI System reaches a decision; it can provide reasoning over uncertainty and can find solutions when conflicting information is faced. In this survey, we elaborate over the topics of Argumentation and XAI combined, by reviewing all the important methods and studies, as well as implementations that use Argumentation to provide Explainability in AI. More specifically, we show how Argumentation can enable Explainability for solving various types of problems in decision-making, justification of an opinion, and dialogues. Subsequently, we elaborate on how Argumentation can help in constructing explainable systems in various applications domains, such as in Medical Informatics, Law, the Semantic Web, Security, Robotics, and some general purpose systems. Finally, we present approaches that combine Machine Learning and Argumentation Theory, toward more interpretable predictive models.

TI  - Endorsement effectiveness of celebrities' avatars: Evidence from multiple experiments
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence have permeated the adoption of avatars in marketing, prompting human celebrities to create virtual representations of themselves in the cyber environment or the Metaverse as an advertising strategy. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence that explicitly substantiates the efficacy of celebrities' avatars in comparison to human beings and other virtual celebrities. Through five studies (comprising one eye-tracking analysis and four online experiments), we find that human celebrities and their avatars can be equally persuasive. Notably, the indirect effect between the endorser type and consumer attitude via perceived novelty is more pronounced when the psychological distance between the consumer and the human celebrity is distal, resulting in greater enjoyment of the advertisements. This research improves the understanding of avatar endorsement and underscores the competitive nature of avatars, which maintain marketing efficacy comparable to that of human celebrities while appealing to consumers through novelty attributes.

TI  - Analysis of the implications of the Moral Machine project as an implementation of the concept of coherent extrapolated volition for building clustered trust in autonomous machines
T2  - ZAGADNIENIA FILOZOFICZNE W NAUCE-PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEMS IN SCIENCE
AB  - In this paper, we focus on the analysis of Eliezer Yudkowsky's concept of "coherent extrapolated volition" (CEV) as a response to the need for a post-conventional, persuasive morality that meets the criteria of active trust in the sense of Anthony Giddens, which could be used in the case of autonomous machines. Based on the analysis of the results of the Moral Machine project, we formulate some guidelines for transformation of the idea of a coherent extrapolated volition into the concept of a coherent, extrapolated and clustered volition. The argumentation used in the paper is intended to show that the idea of CEV transformed into its clustered version can be used to build a technically and socially efficient decision-making pattern database for autonomous machines.

TI  - PREDICTION, PERSUASION, AND THE JURISPRUDENCE OF BEHAVIOURISM
T2  - UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO LAW JOURNAL
AB  - There is a growing literature critiquing the unreflective application of big data, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine-learning techniques to social problems. Such methods may reflect biases rather than reasoned decision making. They also may leave those affected by automated sorting and categorizing unable to understand the basis of the decisions affecting them. Despite these problems, machine-learning experts are feeding judicial opinions to algorithms to predict how future cases will be decided. We call the use of such predictive analytics in judicial contexts a jurisprudence of behaviourism as it rests on a fundamentally Skinnerian model of cognition as a black-boxed transformation of inputs into outputs. In this model, persuasion is passe; what matters is prediction. After describing and critiquing a recent study that has advanced this jurisprudence of behaviourism, we question the value of such research. Widespread deployment of prediction models not based on the meaning of important precedents and facts may endanger the core rule-of-law values.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence and Political Deepfakes: Shaping Citizen Perceptions Through Misinformation
T2  - JOURNAL OF CREATIVE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - In the post-truth age, political conspiracies circulate rapidly on social media, cultivating false narratives, while challenging the public's ability to distinguish truth from fiction. 'Deepfakes' represent the most recent type of misinformation. They display deceitful representations of events to lead audiences to believe in fabricated realities. There has been limited research on deepfakes in political communications. As this technology progresses, deepfakes look deceptively authentic; thus, it is necessary to explore their effects on public perceptions. This study examines viewers' comments on an Instagram-published deepfake video of Hillary Clinton to understand the impact of this technology. The results demonstrate that individuals struggle to identify deepfake videos and that their opinions are affected by this persuasive type of misinformation. This study also explores different ethical concerns posed by political deepfakes. By offering insights into public reactions to manipulated content, this study contributes to our understanding of the political effects of AI-fabricated content.

TI  - An agent-based emotional persuasion model driven by integrated trust assessment
T2  - ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Recent research on automated negotiation has primarily focused on improving the artificial intelligence of agents and equipping them with more flexible internal mechanisms to facilitate high-quality negotiations. However, the study on the systematic modeling of human-like psychological and behavioral activities and their role in the negotiation process is still in its early stages. In light of this, this paper proposes an emotional persuasion model that takes into account the effect of negotiators' integrated trust assessments on negotiation. Firstly, the paper presents a negotiation agent with both cognitive and emotional functions, detailing its internal system and operating mechanism. Secondly, the integrated trust of a negotiator is obtained by evaluating multiple single trusts, and the mapping of the integrated trust to the negotiation round parameter is modeled. Integrated trust is also parameterized into the agent's cognitive processes. Finally, the paper introduces a new framework for the generation of emotional persuasive behavior to assist agents in making new proposals. A series of experiments were conducted, yielding the following results: Compared with the non-emotional model, the performance of negotiation rounds and utility differences improved by 7.97 % and 4.81 %, respectively. Furthermore, the trust- driven emotional persuasion model outperformed the several existing competing models by at least 31.1 % in utility difference and 81.0 % in negotiation rounds. Additionally, a case study of human-computer negotiation demonstrated that the agent designed using the proposed method has negotiating capabilities comparable to those of a real human, which further showcases the application effect of the artificial intelligence agent in practice.

TI  - Why travelers trust and accept self-driving cars: An empirical study
T2  - TRAVEL BEHAVIOUR AND SOCIETY
AB  - Automated vehicle technology is becoming increasingly mature with the development of Artificial Intelligence and information communications technology. It is important to understand the factors affecting the use of automated vehicles. This study investigates user acceptance and the willingness to use fully driverless cars (self-driving cars). Based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we developed a new acceptance model to explore the impact of mass media on adopting self-driving cars. A survey was designed and distributed, and 173 responded. The results show that 84.4% of the respondents are willing to accept driverless cars. At this early stage, the reports from mass media significantly influence people's perception of self-driving cars. The media affect self-efficacy and subjective norms, and thereby people's trust and behavior change. Moreover, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and trust significantly influence their intention to use self-driving cars. This article provides practical guidance to promote self-driving cars: positive media reports will significantly enhance people's trust and intention to use driverless cars.

TI  - Let me transfer you to our AI-based manager: Impact of manager-level job titles assigned to AI-based agents on marketing outcomes
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This paper examines to what extent the job titles assigned to AI agents can influence the customer's perception of these agents and ultimately their marketing outcomes such as customer satisfaction, brand attitude, and intention to buy AI-recommended products. Also, this study explores how customers perceive the AI agent as the manager working with either a human or an AI representative. Across three experiments (using a scenario or a combination of a scenario and the real AI chatbot), the study shows that consumers perceive the AI manager more positively in terms of likeability, knowledgeability, and trustworthiness than the AI representative and the human manager. The customers perceive the AI manager more positively when they are transferred to the AI manager from a representative of the same kind (AI) than from a human representative. Further, the job titles given to the AI agents are found to have favorable downstream effects on customer satisfaction, brand attitude, and the customers' intentions to buy the products recommended during the chat by the AI manager.

TI  - Investigating the Use of an Artificial Intelligence Chatbot with General Chemistry Exam Questions
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION
AB  - The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT was used to answer questions from final exams administered in two general chemistry courses, including questions with closed -response format and with open-response format. For closed -response questions, ChatGPT was very capable at identifying the concept even when the question included a great deal of chemical symbolism. However, ChatGPT's success at solving problems was only 44%, a value well below the class average of 69%. On open -response questions, ChatGPT's responses displayed strong language processing ability with higher performance on questions that could be solved with more generalizable information compared to questions that required specific skills, especially when those topics or skills were primarily found in lecture. Incorrect responses and flawed explanations were often logically sound and would be persuasive to a novice. The chatbot is currently ill-equipped to provide reliable answers or explanations to students for many representative exam questions, but a potential use is to create assignments in which students analyze and improve ChatGPT's responses.

TI  - 'What matters to Andrew'. The problem of premissary relevance in automated health advisors. Insights from pragma-dialectics
T2  - PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING
AB  - Objective: To influence health behavior, communication has to be relevant on an individual level and, thus, fulfill the requirement of premissary relevance. This paper attempts to enrich the design of automated health advisors by, first, reviewing main solutions to the challenge of premissary relevance found in the literature and, second, highlighting the value in this field of the theory of argumentation known as pragma-dialectics.
   Methods: A conceptual paper grounded in persuasion research and argumentation theory.
   Results: Automated health advisors enable argumentative exchanges with users. But there is a need to design these systems as to make them work in an audience-centered perspective. The theory of pragma-dialectics can be used to analyze the factors that favor or hinder the agreement of users to engage in certain health behaviors, and to identify argumentation strategies targeted to behavior change.
   Conclusion: Pragma-dialectics can be used to enhance the design of automated health advisors as it operationalizes the dialogical nature of the reasoning process that can influence health behavior.
   Practice implications: Premissary relevance is a challenge of communication for health promotion at large that can be promisingly addressed through synergies among persuasion research, argumentation theory and Artificial Intelligence. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Digital disruption of dietetics: are we ready?
T2  - JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS
AB  - Digital health is transforming the delivery of health care around the world to meet the growing challenges presented by ageing populations with multiple chronic conditions. Digital health technologies can support the delivery of personalised nutrition care through the standardised Nutrition Care Process (NCP) by using personal data and technology-supported delivery modalities. The digital disruption of traditional dietetic services is occurring worldwide, supporting responsive and high-quality nutrition care. These disruptive technologies include integrated electronic and personal health records, mobile apps, wearables, artificial intelligence and machine learning, conversation agents, chatbots, and social robots. Here, we outline how digital health is disrupting the traditional model of nutrition care delivery and outline the potential for dietitians to not only embrace digital disruption, but also take ownership in shaping it, aiming to enhance patient care. An overview is provided of digital health concepts and disruptive technologies according to the four steps in the NCP: nutrition assessment, diagnosis, intervention, and monitoring and evaluation. It is imperative that dietitians stay abreast of these technological developments and be the leaders of the disruption, not simply subject to it. By doing so, dietitians now, as well as in the future, will maximise their impact and continue to champion evidence-based nutrition practice.

TI  - Dual-process theory-driven transparent approach for seniors to accept health misinformation detection results
T2  - INFORMATION PROCESSING & MANAGEMENT
AB  - Given seniors' concerns about the reliability of black-box models in health misinformation detection (HMID), there is a pressing need for explainable HMID methods that provide transparency and instill trust. Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) aims to foster understanding and trust in AI models by implementing transparency that embodies explainability and interpretability. However, most existing explainable HMID methods solely provide post-hoc explanations and neglect the interpretation of the models' internal logic, which prevents seniors from satisfactorily accepting the HMID results. Therefore, this study proposes a transparent Knowledge Graph-aware Two-Stage approach (KG2S) driven by the dual-process theory. KG2S combines explainability and interpretability by utilizing knowledge graphs (KGs) in two stages: Knowledge Breadth Retrieval (KBR) and Knowledge Depth Reasoning (KDR). These stages correspond with the heuristic and analytic processes of the dual-process theory, which encompasses human information processing. In the KBR stage, we leverage rich facts in KGs to replicate heuristic distillation behaviors of humans through a novel similarity-diversity twofold filter. In the KDR stage, we employ a hierarchical attention network to emulate humans' coarse-to-fine knowledge analyses during decision-making. Extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets, along with user testing, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results demonstrated that the proposed model not only outperformed competing methods in terms of HMID accuracy but also provided persuasive detection processes and reasons. Moreover, the model showed high adaptability to new topics in HMID. Our research offers valuable insights into integrating humanistic into AI algorithms and promoting the trustworthiness of AI systems.

TI  - Ketone bodies detection: Wearable and mobile sensors for personalized medicine and nutrition
T2  - TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY
AB  - The development of mobile and wearable sensing devices for continuous ketone detection has received tremendous recent attention. These devices have opened the doors to personalized medicine applica-tions related to the management of ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis and to personalized nutrition and wellness (particularly in connection to ketogenic diet). This review discusses the importance of ketone bodies, past and recent advances in decentralized ketone sensing strategies towards such important biomedical and nutrition applications. Special attention is given to electrochemical sensing platforms for on-site and wearable detection of I3-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the dominant physiological ketone bodies, and to the challenges of using the corresponding dehydrogenase enzyme for extended on-body BHB monitoring. Future trends, opportunities, and challenges towards frequent home self-testing and continuous monitoring of ketone bodies for personalized healthcare, nutrition, and wellness are dis-cussed in connection to mobile and wearable devices coupled to artificial intelligence towards sup-porting dietary behavior change.(c) 2023 Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Impact of a Health Coach-Led, Text-Based Digital Behavior Change Intervention on Weight Loss and Psychological Well-Beingin Patients Receiving a Procedureless Intragastric Balloon Program: Prospective Single-Arm Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Digital health interventions show promise for weight management. However, few text-based behavior change interventions have been designed to support patients receiving intragastric balloons, and none have simultaneously evaluated weight loss, psychological well-being, and behavior change despite the crucial interplay of these factors in weight management. Objective: This study aims to assess whether a health coach-led, asynchronous, text-based digital behavior change coaching intervention (DBCCI) delivered to participants receiving an intragastric balloon and its aftercare program was feasible and acceptable to participants and supported improved outcomes, including weight loss, psychological well-being, and lifestyle behavior change conducive to weight loss maintenance. Methods: This 12-month, single-arm prospective study enrolled adults aged 21 to 65 years with BMI >= 27 kg/m(2) receiving a procedureless intragastric balloon (PIGB) at 5 bariatric clinics in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Participants received the DBCCI and the clinic-led PIGB aftercare program (remotely delivered) for 6 months after PIGB placement and then no intervention for an additional 6 months. The DBCCI was an evidence-based, personalized intervention wherein health coaches supported participants via exchanged asynchronous in-app text-based messages. Over the 12-month study, we assessed percentage of total body weight loss and psychological well-being via self-administered validated questionnaires (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life-Lite-Clinical Trials Version, Loss of Control Over Eating Scale-Brief, Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire-Short Form, and Barriers to Being Active Quiz). Participant engagement with and acceptability of the intervention were assessed via self-reported surveys. Results: Overall, 107 participants (n=96, 89.7% female; mean baseline BMI 35.4, SD 5.4 kg/m(2)) were included in the analysis. Mean total body weight loss was 13.5% (SEM 2.3%) at the end of the DBCCI and 11.22% (SEM 2.3%) at the 12-month follow-up (P<.001). Improvements were observed for all psychological well-being measures throughout the 12 months except for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (improvement at month 1) and Barriers to Being Active Quiz (improvements at months 3 and 6). Surveys showed high levels of engagement with and acceptability of the DBCCI. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the health coach-led, asynchronous, text-based DBCCI was engaging and acceptable to participants with overweight and obesity. The DBCCI, delivered alongside the PIGB and its aftercare program, supported improved weight loss outcomes and psychological well-being versus baseline and was associated with lifestyle behavior changes known to help achieve and maintain long-term weight loss and improved health outcomes. Follow-up findings suggest a potential need for longer-term, more intense coaching to focus on weight loss maintenance and support ongoing self-coaching. This could be achieved by leveraging generative artificial intelligence to provide ongoing automated behavior change coaching support to augment human-led care.

AB  - Data-centric targeting with artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming advertising by using machine learning and big data to target consumers, creating value for both consumers and brands. Despite the growing interest in ethnicity targeting in social media, there is still much to learn about leveraging ethnicity data for advertising research and practice. In this study, we surveyed 1,030 Black U.S. social media users to explore their understanding of AI and data gathering related to ethnicity. We focused on ethnic affinity targeting (EAT), a controversial tactic used by social media platforms. Our results indicate that the ethical aspects of persuasion knowledge, specifically appropriateness beliefs, affect consumers' coping strategies through distinct mechanisms. Consumers' ethnic identification and the stability of their affinity feelings toward social media also influence intentions to use specific coping strategies. These findings suggest that consumers' perceptions of ethnicity targeting depend on how advertisers collect and use ethnicity data and underscore the importance of diverse perspectives to inform algorithm transparency practices and policies.

TI  - Influence of human versus AI recommenders: The roles of product type and cognitive processes
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Previous research suggests that consumers would listen more to product recommendations from other consumers (human recommenders) than from systems based on artificial intelligence (AI recommenders). We hypothesize that this might depend on the type of product being recommended, and propose an underlying process driving this effect. Three experiments show that, for hedonic products (but not for utilitarian products), human recommenders are more effective than AI recommenders in influencing consumer reactions toward the recommended product. This effect occurs because, when compared to AI recommenders, human recommenders elicit stronger mentalizing responses in consumers. This, in turn, helps consumers self-reference the product to their own needs. However, humanizing AI recommenders increases mentalizing and self-referencing responses, thus increasing the effectiveness of this type of recommenders for hedonic products. Together, these findings provide insight into when and why consumers might rely more on product recommendations from humans as compared to AI recommenders.

TI  - Deepfakes as a Democratic Threat: Experimental Evidence Shows Noxious Effects That Are Reducible Through Journalistic Fact Checks
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PRESS-POLITICS
AB  - Concerns have been raised over AI-generated deepfakes and their impact on democracy. Unlike earlier forms of disinformation relying on text or traditional video-editing techniques (cheapfakes), deepfakes employ artificial intelligence, provoking speculations that they may be even more persuasive and harder to debunk. Using an experiment with a multiple-message design (N = 2,085), we found that fake videos suggesting a sex, corruption, or prejudice scandal-but not text-only fakes-elicited substantial reputational damage for an innocent politician, regardless of whether the underlying technique was "cheap" or "deep." This was visible in altered attitudes, emotions, and voting intentions. However, exposure to a journalistic fact-check substantially reduced and even eliminated the detrimental effects. These findings have important implications for our theoretical understanding related to the effects of and mitigation strategies for deepfakes. While clearly highlighting the significant persuasive potential of deepfakes (and visual disinformation in general), the present study paints a more nuanced picture than was previously possible.

TI  - AI-powered recommendations: the roles of perceived similarity and psychological distance on persuasion
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays various roles in our daily lives, such as personal assistant, salesperson, and virtual counselors; thus, it stands out in various fields as a recommendation agent. This study explored the effects of perceived similarity and psychological distance on the persuasion of AI recommendation agents through two experiments. Results of Experiment 1 elucidated that individuals feel more psychologically distant when they interact with AI recommendation agents than with human agents as a result of a different level of perceived similarity. Furthermore, psychological distance plays a mediating role in determining the effectiveness of desirability- vs. feasibility-focused messages in health-related issues. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the AI speaker's level of perceived similarity via anthropomorphism and found that the AI's recommendation with secondary (vs. primary) features is more effective when AI is humanized, and the reverse was found in non-humanized AI conditions. Both theoretical and managerial implications are provided.

TI  - Putting the "Me" in endorsement: Understanding and conceptualizing dimensions of self-endorsement using intelligent personal assistants
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB  - Self-endorsement-depicting the "self" as an endorser of a brand-represents a potentially powerful advertising strategy made possible by new media. This experiment tests the hypothesis that receiving brand recommendations from an intelligent personal assistant believed to be tailored to one's own characteristics and consumer interests yields higher brand attitude and purchase intention toward the (self-endorsed) brand than receiving brand recommendations from a typical, but not self-tailored, intelligent personal assistant. Because endorsement is a well-known and highly effective advertising strategy, this is a high bar. We present evidence for self-referencing as an underlying mechanism, and perceived interactivity and identification as boundary conditions of self-endorsing. Consumers may show skepticism toward advertising but may not know how to be skeptical of themselves. As consumers outsource their tasks and decisions to new artificial intelligence (AI)-driven devices, they will need to be attentive to new media biases that threaten productive use of these devices.

TI  - I Was Born to Love AI: The Influence of Social Status on AI Self-Efficacy and Intentions to Use AI
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - This study employed a survey to examine the role of social status on the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. One's self-efficacy with using AI technology was assumed to be determined by various factors coming from demographic status, which ultimately leads to the intention to use that technology. This was hypothesized based on the technology acceptance model, self-efficacy, and diffusion of innovation. Participants (n = 369) reported their perceived mastery of AI products, vicarious experiences with AI products, social persuasions of using AI products, AI self- efficacy, perceived usefulness of AI, perceived ease of using AI, intention to use AI, and demographic information. Both education level and income were found to affect the intention to adopt AI technology through AI self-efficacy. However, the age of participants was found not to be a determinant. The implications of the findings for applications and theory are discussed.

TI  - Antecedents and consequences of fake reviews in a marketing approach: An overview and synthesis
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Fake reviews, characterized as misleading, can be positive, negative, or neutral, varying greatly across sectors and products. Their detrimental effects include reducing the informativeness and credibility of genuine reviews, leading to a distorted perception of products and affecting the development of online product reviews. This literature synthesis proposes a multidisciplinary approach to understand and combat fake reviews, emphasizing the need to differentiate them from genuine feedback through psychological and technological tactics. It outlines the importance of exploring the credibility routes influencing consumer behavior, the dynamics of fake review production, and the consequential effects on businesses and consumers. It also highlights the emergence of artificial intelligence as a powerful tool in identifying and combating fake reviews, advocating for continued exploration of detection strategies to preserve integrity and trust in online marketplaces. Lastly, it suggests avenues of research to deepen our knowledge of the antecedents and consequences of fake reviews, as well as of the various means available to prevent them, including technological, behavioral, and regulatory strategies.

TI  - On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything
T2  - SURVIVAL
AB  - Poker has often been used as a metaphor for international relations and existential threats such as nuclear weapons. Nate Silver's On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything is a lengthy, often meandering but always entertaining exploration of this metaphor and its salience in the twenty-first century, from the world of professional gambling to existential risks such as climate change, nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence. The book has two entangled but independent threads: a discussion on how to think about risk, and a sociocultural conceit that modern elites, especially in the United States, can be meaningfully divided into two tribes competing for power and influence. What separates these groups are not, as Silver contends, cognitive and psychological traits, but in-group jargon and cultural references. Silver's discussions and insights about how to think about risk do not need this dichotomy to be real or sound; in fact; the conceit offers more distraction than insight.

TI  - Questioning 'what makes us human': How audiences react to an artificial intelligence-driven show
T2  - COGNITIVE COMPUTATION AND SYSTEMS
AB  - I am Echoborg is promoted as 'a show created afresh each time by the audience in conversation with an artificial intelligence (AI)'. The show demonstrates how AI in a creative and performance context can raise questions about the technology's ethical use for persuasion and compliance, and how humans can reclaim agency. This audience study focuses on a consecutive three-night run in Bristol, UK in October 2019. The different outcomes of each show illustrate the unpredictability of audience interactions with conversational AI and how the collective dynamic of audience members shapes each performance. This study analyses (1) how I am Echoborg facilitates audience cocreation in a live performance context, (2) the show's capacity to provoke nuanced understandings of the potential for AI and (3) the ability for intelligent technology to facilitate social interaction and group collaboration. This audience study demonstrates how the show inspires debate beyond binary conclusions (i.e. AI as good or bad) and how audiences can understand potential creative uses of AI, including as a tool for cocreating entertainment with (not just for) them.

TI  - Evaluation of Dietary Management Using Artificial Intelligence and Human Interventions: Nonrandomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: There has been an increase in personal health records with the increased use of wearable devices and smartphone apps to improve health. Traditional health promotion programs by human professionals have limitations in terms of cost and reach. Due to labor shortages and to save costs, there has been a growing emphasis in the medical field on building health guidance systems using artificial intelligence (AI). AI will replace advanced human tasks to some extent in the future. However, it is difficult to sustain behavioral change through technology alone at present.
   Objective: This study investigates whether AI alone can effectively encourage healthy behaviors or whether human interventions are needed to achieve and sustain health-related behavioral change. We examined the effectiveness of AI and human interventions to encourage dietary management behaviors. In addition, we elucidated the conditions for maximizing the effect of AI on health improvement. We hypothesized that the combination of AI and human interventions will maximize their effectiveness.
   Methods: We conducted a 3-month experiment by recruiting participants who were users of a smartphone diet management app. We recruited 102 participants and divided them into 3 groups. Treatment group I received text messages using the standard features of the app (AI-based text message intervention). Treatment group II received video messages from a companion, in addition to the text messages (combined text message and human video message intervention by AI). The control group used the app to keep a dietary record, but no feedback was provided (no intervention). We examine the participants' continuity and the effects on physical indicators.
   Results: Combined AI and video messaging (treatment group II) led to a lower dropout rate from the program compared to the control group, and the Cox proportional-hazards model estimate showed a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.078, which was statistically significant at the 5% level. Further, human intervention with AI and video messaging significantly reduced the body fat percentage (BFP) of participants after 3 months compared to the control group, and the rate of reduction was greater in the group with more individualized intervention. The AI-based text messages affected the BMI but had no significant effect on the BFP.
   Conclusions: This experiment shows that it is challenging to sustain participants' healthy behavior with AI intervention alone. The results also suggest that even if the health information conveyed is the same, the information conveyed by humans and AI is more effective in improving health than the information sent by AI alone. The support received from the companion in the form of video messages may have promoted voluntary health behaviors. It is noteworthy that companions were competent, even though they were nonexperts. This means that person-to-person communication is crucial for health interventions.

TI  - Positing a Sense of Agency-Aware Persuasive AI: Its Theoretical and Computational Frameworks
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2021)
CP  - 16th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (Persuasive)
AB  - The notion of a persuasive technology (PT) that is autonomous and intelligent, and more importantly, cognizant of and sensitive to human sense of agency (SoA), i.e., the subjective feeling or judgement that oneself is in control of situations, remains to be theorized, conceptualized and elucidated. Three important questions have emerged from our investigations: (1) why does SoA matter in the design of PT, (2) what computational principles in artificial intelligence (AI) underlie an adaptive PT, and (3) how can this intelligent PT sense, make sense of, and respond sensibly to dynamic changes in SoA under complex settings? We elucidate in this paper our theoretical and computational frameworks to answer our research queries. For the theoretical aspect, we propose an integration of pertinent theories in the cognitive, social and neurosciences that explain the emergence and disruption of SoA. Using this integration as theory of mind, we propose a computational framework for SoA-aware persuasive AI that integrates methods in cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, causal inferencing, explainable AI planning and generative actor-critic learning.

TI  - Does humanization or machinization make the IoT persuasive? The effects of source orientation and social presence
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has revolutionized both the roles and functions of everyday objects and how users interact with them. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and an advanced capacity for communication, smart objects can now function as communication sources and deliver persuasive messages. This study investigates how different types of agency and source cues shape the persuasiveness of a smart object via social presence. When users interacted with a smart object that exerted its own agency, they sensed greater social presence when the object used machine cues rather than human cues. Conversely, when users interacted with a smart object that allowed the user to exercise their own agency, human cues, rather than machine cues, produced greater feelings of social presence, which enhanced the persuasiveness of the messages conveyed by the object. However, the persuasive effects of social presence were reversed when the interaction prompted AI anxiety in the user.

TI  - The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Communication Dynamics and Performance in Organizational Leadership
T2  - ADMINISTRATIVE SCIENCES
AB  - This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies on leadership-based organizational communication and employee performance within contemporary workplaces. While prior research has acknowledged AI's potential in optimizing communication processes, significant gaps remain in understanding its specific influence on core communication dimensions and organizational outcomes. This study addresses these gaps by examining six key communication elements-informing, message reception, feedback, acceptance, persuasion, and reaction-to assess whether AI technologies significantly enhance employee performance by improving internal communication efficiency and reducing transmission errors, which are crucial for productive interactions. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire from 203 employees of a major Romanian food industry company operating globally, including leaders and employees from three Eastern European countries. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the relationships between communication dimensions and performance. The findings revealed that informing, receiving, and accepting messages, along with reaction-provoking, had strong positive effects on performance, while feedback and persuasion showed moderate impacts. These results emphasize the transformative role of AI in communication processes, optimizing message flow and positively influencing employee behavior, thereby enhancing productivity and organizational efficiency. This research contributes to the growing body of literature by situating AI-driven communication within the broader organizational context, offering actionable insights for managers aiming to integrate AI ethically and effectively. Additionally, it offers a set of recommendations for employees and managers to lead communication process according to the new actual era of digitization, which is offering real benefits for both parts. It also provides a robust foundation for future research, encouraging longitudinal and cross-cultural studies to further investigate AI's implications for organizational diversity, innovation, and employee well-being.

TI  - AI Chatbots for Mental Health: A Scoping Review of Effectiveness, Feasibility, and Applications
T2  - APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB  - Mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, and there is a global shortage of mental health professionals. AI chatbots have emerged as a potential solution, offering accessible and scalable mental health interventions. This study aimed to conduct a scoping review to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of AI chatbots in treating mental health conditions. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycNet, as well as using AI-powered tools like Microsoft Copilot and Consensus. Relevant studies on AI chatbot interventions for mental health were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by multiple reviewers. The search yielded 15 eligible studies covering various application areas, such as mental health support during COVID-19, interventions for specific conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance use disorders), preventive care, health promotion, and usability assessments. AI chatbots demonstrated potential benefits in improving mental and emotional well-being, addressing specific mental health conditions, and facilitating behavior change. However, challenges related to usability, engagement, and integration with existing healthcare systems were identified. AI chatbots hold promise for mental health interventions, but widespread adoption hinges on improving usability, engagement, and integration with healthcare systems. Enhancing personalization and context-specific adaptation is key. Future research should focus on large-scale trials, optimal human-AI integration, and addressing ethical and social implications.

TI  - "I know it's a deepfake": the role of AI disclaimers and comprehension in the processing of deepfake parodies
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - Rapid innovations in media technologies have ushered in diverse entertainment avenues, including politically oriented content, presenting both novel opportunities and societal challenges. This study delves into the implications of the burgeoning deepfake phenomenon, particularly focusing on audience interpretation and engagement with deepfake parodies, a quintessential example of "misinfotainment." Additionally, it examines the potential impact of artificial intelligence (AI) disclaimers on audience understanding and related consequences. To probe this, two experiments (N = 2,808) were executed featuring parodied politicians adopting opposing viewpoints on the issue of climate change. U.S. participants were either exposed to deepfake videos prefaced with AI disclaimers or without. Results indicate that the inclusion of an AI disclaimer significantly influenced audience comprehension and their ability to recognize the parody. These factors were subsequently associated with enjoyment, discounting, and counterarguing, which in turn showed different relationships with policy support and sharing intentions. This article culminates with insights into the theoretical underpinnings and practical ramifications of these findings.

TI  - Essential elements of weight loss apps for a multi-ethnic population with high BMI: a qualitative study with practical recommendations
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - Lay Summary Weight loss smartphone apps are ubiquitous but the essential elements needed and preferred by people with overweight and obesity remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a qualitative study to explore the perceptions and needs of this population in a weight loss app to prolong app engagement and enhance weight loss success. 22 participants were interviewed through face-to-face or videoconferencing sessions during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interview transcripts were analyzed within and between participants to develop codes, subthemes and themes that represent the participants' perceptions and needs in weight loss apps. Participants expressed the need for (a) comprehensive and flexible calorie counters; (b) holistic, gradual, and individualized behavior change recommendations tailored for people with overweight and obesity; and (c) just-in-time reminders of future consequences. Our findings showed a need to incorporate flexible options for food logging; break down general recommendations into small steps towards sustainable changes; tailor app contents for people with overweight and obesity; and evoke one's considerations of future consequences. Future apps could consider leveraging the capacity of artificial intelligence to provide personalized weight management in terms of sustaining self-regulation behaviors, optimizing goal-setting and providing personalized and timely recommendations for weight loss.
   Essential smartphone app elements for weight loss were uncovered. Practical recommendations for the development of weight loss apps are provided.
   Smartphone weight loss apps are constantly being developed but the essential elements needed by a multi-ethnic population with overweight and obesity remains unclear. Purpose: To explore the perceptions of an Asian multi-ethnic population with overweight and obesity on the essential elements of weight loss apps. Twenty two participants were purposively sampled from a specialist weight management clinic in Singapore from 13 April to 30 April 2021. Recorded interviews were conducted using face-to-face and videoconferencing modalities. Data saturation was reached at the 18th participant. Data analysis was performed using inductive content analysis with constant comparison between and within transcripts. Findings: Three themes and eight subthemes on the essential app components emerged-(a) comprehensive and flexible calorie counters; (b) holistic, gradual and individualized behavior change recommendations tailored for people with overweight and obesity, and (c) just-in-time reminders of future consequences. There was a need to incorporate flexible options for food logging; break down general recommendations into small steps towards sustainable changes; tailor app contents for people with overweight and obesity; and evoke one's considerations of future consequences. Future weight loss apps should be designed to meet the needs of those with overweight and obesity, the very population that needs assistance with weight loss. Future apps could consider leveraging the capacity of artificial intelligence to provide personalized weight management in terms of sustaining self-regulation behaviors, optimizing goal-setting and providing personalized and timely recommendations for weight loss.

TI  - Searle's Chinese box: Debunking the Chinese room argument
T2  - MINDS AND MACHINES
AB  - John Searle's Chinese room argument is perhaps the mast influential and widely cited argument against artificial intelligence (AI). Understood as targeting AI proper-claims that computers can think or do think - Searle's argument, despite its rhetorical hash, is logically and scientifically a dud. Advertised as effective against AI proper, the argument, in its main outlines, is an ignoratio elenchi. It musters persuasive force fallaciously by indirection fostered by equivocal deployment of the phrase ''strong AI'' and reinforced by equivocation on the phrase ''causal powers' (at least) equal to those of brains.'' On a more carefully crafted understanding - understood just to target metaphysical identification of thought with computation (''Functionalism'' or ''Computationalism'') and not AI proper the argument is still unsound, though more interestingly so. It's unsound in ways difficult for high church - ''someday my prince of an AI program will come'' - believers in AI to acknowledge without undermining their high church beliefs. The ad hominem bite of Searle's argument against the high church persuasions of so many cognitive scientists, I suggest, largely explains the undeserved repute this really quite disreputable argument enjoys among them.

TI  - Fact-checking in the age of AI: Reducing biases with non-human information sources
T2  - TECHNOLOGY IN SOCIETY
AB  - This study examines the obstacles to the effectiveness of fact-checking, focusing primarily on the pervasive impact of entrenched biases. Fact-checking efforts often face resistance when linked to mistrusted sources, leading to cognitive dissonance and the rejection of messages in favor of pre-existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning. This resistance hinders organizations' ability to correct misconceptions surrounding social issues and entities. The research delves into whether non-human entities such as AI can facilitate less biased information processing due to their perceived impartiality. Applying a moderated mediation model in experimental settings, we found that labeling a source as artificial intelligence is pivotal in evaluating factchecking. AI labels moderate the impact of partisan biases on the persuasive outcomes of fact-checks, such as message credibility and acceptance, compared to the human source. This study offers valuable insights for enhancing the effectiveness of fact-checking in the context of cognitive and psychological biases by highlighting the critical influence of information sources in reducing polarization in public perceptions of scientific issues.

TI  - AI-Driven Mediation Strategies for Audience Depolarisation in Online Debates
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2024 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYTEMS, CHI 2024
CP  - CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Sytems (CHI)
AB  - Online polarisation can tear the fabric of civility through reinforcing social media's perceptions of division and discord. Social media platforms often rely on content-moderation to combat polarisation, contingent on the reactive removal or fagging of content. However, this approach often remains agnostic of the underlying debate's ideas and stifes open discourse. In this study, we use prompt-tuned language models to mediate social media debates, applying the strategies of the Thomas-Kilmann Confict Mode Instrument (TKI). We evaluate multiple mediation strategies in providing targeted responses to the debates, as shown to a debate audience. Our findings show that high-cooperativeness TKI strategies ofered more persuasive arguments, while an accommodating argument strategy was the most successful at depolarising the audience's opinion. Furthermore, high-cooperativeness strategies also increased the perception that the debaters will reach a consensus. Our work paves the way for scalable and personalised tools that mediate social media debates to encourage depolarisation.

TI  - Effects of Consumers' Belief in a Just World on Artificial Intelligence Recommendations: Mediating Effects of Perceived Benevolence and Selfishness
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING
AB  - This study investigated the effect of users' "belief in a just world" (BJW) on the persuasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) agents' recommendations. Our prediction that users' preferences for human or AI agents vary according to their BJW levels was tested experimentally. The results revealed that individuals with high BJW rated human agents' recommendations more favorably than those of AI agents, whereas those with low BJW preferred AI agents' ones. This interaction was mediated by the perceptions of the agents' benevolence and selfishness, which varied depending on the BJW levels and agent type. High-BJW individuals perceived human agents as more benevolent and less selfish, whereas low-BJW individuals showed the opposite pattern. In contrast, AI agents' benevolence and selfishness perceptions were not influenced by BJW levels. This study provides theoretical insights by identifying BJW as a key factor affecting AI agents' persuasive effects and suggests that perceived benevolence and selfishness are the psychological mechanisms behind these effects. These findings also offer practical guidance for designing more effective AI agent strategies tailored to consumer BJW levels.

TI  - Face the Uncanny: The Effects of Doppelganger Talking Head Avatars on Affect-Based Trust Toward Artificial Intelligence Technology are Mediated by Uncanny Valley Perceptions
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING
AB  - This experiment (N=228) examined how exposure to a talking head doppelganger created by an artificial intelligence (AI) program influenced affect-based trust toward AIs. Using a 3 (talking head featuring the participant's or a stranger's face, audio-only condition) by 2 (pro-AI pitch and anti-AI pitch playback) design, we uncovered that exposure to a talking head featuring the participant's face instead of a stranger's face increased uncanny valley perceptions. Furthermore, uncanny valley perceptions mediated the link between exposure to a talking head with the participant's face on affect-based trust. Overall, exposure to a doppelganger talking head, who delivered a persuasive pitch, triggered discomfort on the participant whose features were sourced to craft a synthetic talking head, which in turn decreased affect-based trust attributed to AIs. This phenomenon is rooted in basic psychological mechanisms that underpin the uncanny valley hypothesis. Future studies may test for these findings across different platforms and also provide evidence regarding user mental processing.

TI  - The Role of a Smart Health Ecosystem in Transforming the Management of Chronic Health Conditions
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - The effective management of chronic conditions requires an approach that promotes a shift in care from the clinic to the home, improves the efficiency of health care systems, and benefits all users irrespective of their needs and preferences. Digital health can provide a solution to this challenge, and in this paper, we provide our vision for a smart health ecosystem. A smart health ecosystem leverages the interoperability of digital health technologies and advancements in big data and artificial intelligence for data collection and analysis and the provision of support. We envisage that this approach will allow a comprehensive picture of health, personalization, and tailoring of behavioral and clinical support; drive theoretical advancements; and empower people to manage their own health with support from health care professionals. We illustrate the concept with 2 use cases and discuss topics for further consideration and research, concluding with a message to encourage people with chronic conditions, their caregivers, health care professionals, policy and decision makers, and technology experts to join their efforts and work toward adopting a smart health ecosystem.

TI  - Research on Human Behavior Modeling of Sports Culture Communication in Industrial 4.0 Intelligent Management
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
AB  - With the advent of the information age, Internet technology and computer technology are gradually applied in various fields. Human daily life is inseparable from the help of information technology. The progress and development of the times are also changing our industrial environment. The Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and digital production have been widely used in the industrial field. We need to integrate the new intelligent management concept in the industrial 4.0 era into the modern industrial system and media communication. In the communication of sports culture, how to integrate the intelligent technology under the background of industry 4.0 and realize the spatiotemporal modeling and analysis of human behavior and behavior characteristics is the main content of our research. Firstly, this study briefly analyzes the development and historical process of industry 4.0 era and explores the impact of Internet of things and information technology on sports culture communication. This study analyzes the development process of Chinese sports culture communication and probes into the influence and significance of sports culture communication on human behavior. Under the background of industrial 4.0 management, a model of human temporal and spatial behavior change in sports culture communication is established. Human behavior trajectory is analyzed by data mining, human behavior recognition algorithm, behavior quantitative analysis method, and behavior feature model. The results show that under the background of industry 4.0 management, human behavior modeling can clearly describe the basic characteristics and behavior state in the process of sports culture communication and can predict and analyze the human behavior performance of such social activities and phenomena. Through data mining, data preprocessing, and behavior quantitative analysis, human behavior trajectory is studied. It has a positive impact on the behavior trend in human daily life. The main factor affecting behavior change is whether to receive sports culture news.

TI  - Exploring Older Adults' Perspectives and Acceptance of AI-Driven Health Technologies: Qualitative Study
T2  - JMIR AGING
AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied in various health care services due to its enhanced efficiency and accuracy. As the population ages, AI-based health technologies could be a potent tool in older adults' health care to address growing, complex, and challenging health needs. This study aimed to investigate perspectives on and acceptability of the use of AI-led health technologies among older adults and the potential challenges that they face in adopting them. The findings from this inquiry could inform the designing of more acceptable and user-friendly AI-based health technologies. Objective: The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate the attitudes and perceptions of older adults toward the use of AI-based health technologies; (2) to identify potential facilitators, barriers, and challenges influencing older adults' preferences toward AI-based health technologies; and (3) to inform strategies that can promote and facilitate the use of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design. A total of 27 community-dwelling older adults were recruited from a local community center. Three sessions of semistructured interviews were conducted, each lasting 1 hour. The sessions covered five key areas: (1) general impressions of AI-based health technologies; (2) previous experiences with AI-based health technologies; (3) perceptions and attitudes toward AI-based health technologies; (4) anticipated difficulties in using AI-based health technologies and underlying reasons; and (5) willingness, preferences, and motivations for accepting AI-based health technologies. Thematic analysis was applied for data analysis. The Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model behavior change wheel were integrated into the analysis. Identified theoretical domains were mapped directly to the COM-B model to determine corresponding strategies for enhancing the acceptability of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Results: The analysis identified 9 of the 14 Theoretical Domains Framework domains-knowledge, skills, social influences, environmental context and resources, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, intentions, goals, and emotion. These domains were mapped to 6 components of the COM-B model. While most participants acknowledged the potential benefits of AI-based health technologies, they emphasized the irreplaceable role of human expertise and interaction. Participants expressed concerns about the usability of AI technologies, highlighting the need for user-friendly and tailored AI solutions. Privacy concerns and the importance of robust security measures were also emphasized as critical factors affecting their willingness to adopt AI-based health technologies. Conclusions: Integrating AI as a supportive tool alongside health care providers, rather than regarding it as a replacement, was highlighted as a key strategy for promoting acceptance. Government support and clear guidelines are needed to promote ethical AI implementation in health care. These measures can improve health outcomes in the older adult population by encouraging the adoption of AI-driven health technologies.

TI  - The hallucinating chatbot 'ChatGPT' poorly estimates real bird commonness
T2  - BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of increasingly sophisticated chatbot technologies, with ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, gaining significant popularity. As public awareness of environmental issues has grown during recent decades, there is an increasing demand for access to information about the environment. ChatGPT which offers free, real-time information via a user-friendly interface, has the potential to fill this gap. However, empirical evaluations of reliability and quality of information provided by chatbots are needed. In this study, the biological information provided by GPT-3.5 is evaluated. The commonness indices of 199 bird species in Poland, estimated by the ChatGPT, are correlated with the real commonness indices obtained during ornithological survey conducted across 700 1 x 1 km squares. Bird commonness indices pro-vided by ChatGPT were generally positively correlated (r <= 0.6) with bird abundance and occurrence. However, this correlation was not particularly strong. Correlation was especially poor for less common species (i.e., below 1000 individuals recorded during bird monitoring), and some of rare or very rare species were incorrectly identified by ChatGPT as relatively common. Moreover, ChatGPT seemed confident, realistic and persuasive in providing obviously incorrect responses (possibly due to lack of training data), much like it would for correct responses. Generating such false responses due to data deficiency is commonly referred to as "hallucination" of a chatbot. While chatbots can potentially be powerful tools for delivering environmental information, better control over the training process is necessary.

TI  - User-Centered Design of A Novel Risk Prediction Behavior Change Tool Augmented With an Artificial Intelligence Engine (MyDiabetesIQ): A Sociotechnical Systems Approach
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Diabetes and its complications account for 10% of annual health care spending in the United Kingdom. Digital health care interventions (DHIs) can provide scalable care, fostering diabetes self-management and reducing the risk of complications. Tailorability (providing personalized interventions) and usability are key to DHI engagement/effectiveness. User-centered design of DHIs (aligning features to end users' needs) can generate more usable interventions, avoiding unintended consequences and improving user engagement.
   Objective: MyDiabetesIQ (MDIQ) is an artificial intelligence engine intended to predict users' diabetes complications risk. It will underpin a user interface in which users will alter lifestyle parameters to see the impact on their future risks. MDIQ will link to an existing DHI, My Diabetes My Way (MDMW). We describe the user-centered design of the user interface of MDIQ as informed by human factors engineering.
   Methods: Current users of MDMW were invited to take part in focus groups to gather their insights about users being shown their likelihood of developing diabetes-related complications and any risks they perceived from using MDIQ. Findings from focus groups informed the development of a prototype MDIQ interface, which was then user-tested through the "think aloud" method, in which users speak aloud about their thoughts/impressions while performing prescribed tasks. Focus group and think aloud transcripts were analyzed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive analysis. For think aloud data, a sociotechnical model was used as a framework for thematic analysis.
   Results: Focus group participants (n=8) felt that some users could become anxious when shown their future complications risks. They highlighted the importance of easy navigation, jargon avoidance, and the use of positive/encouraging language. User testing of the prototype site through think aloud sessions (n=7) highlighted several usability issues. Issues included confusing visual cues and confusion over whether user-updated information fed back to health care teams. Some issues could be compounded for users with limited digital skills. Results from the focus groups and think aloud workshops were used in the development of a live MDIQ platform.
   Conclusions: Acting on the input of end users at each iterative stage of a digital tool's development can help to prioritize users throughout the design process, ensuring the alignment of DHI features with user needs. The use of the sociotechnical framework encouraged the consideration of interactions between different sociotechnical dimensions in finding solutions to issues, for example, avoiding the exclusion of users with limited digital skills. Based on user feedback, the tool could scaffold good goal setting, allowing users to balance their palatable future complications risk against acceptable lifestyle changes. Optimal control of diabetes relies heavily on self-management. Tools such as MDMW/ MDIQ can offer personalized support for self-management alongside access to users' electronic health records, potentially helping to delay or reduce long-term complications, thereby providing significant reductions in health care costs.

TI  - Preparing for an Era of Deepfakes and AI-Generated Ads: A Framework for Understanding Responses to Manipulated Advertising
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - Traditionally, the production and distribution of advertising material has relied on human effort and analog tools. However, technological innovations have given the advertising industry digital and automatic tools that enable advertisers to automate many advertising processes and produce "synthetic ads," or ads comprising content based on the artificial and automatic production and modification of data. The emerging practice of synthetic advertising, to date the most sophisticated form of ad manipulation, relies on various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, such as deepfakes and generative adversarial networks (GANs), to automatically create content that depicts an unreal, albeit convincing, artificial version of reality. In this article, a general framework is constructed to better understand how consumers respond to all forms of ad manipulation. It is anticipated that this article will help explain how consumers respond to the more sophisticated forms of synthetic ads-such as deepfakes-that are emerging at an accelerating rate. To guide research in this area, a research agenda is developed focusing on three manipulated advertising areas: ad falsity, consumer response, and originality. Furthermore, the implications for theory and industry are considered.

TI  - "I Like Your Suggestion!" the role of humanlikeness and parasocial relationship on the website versus voice shopper's perception of recommendations
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB  - Voice assistants are changing the way consumers shop. Guided by the anthropomorphism literature and parasocial interaction theory, this study investigated how the new unique relationship between consumers and artificial intelligence-powered voice assistants may affect the way consumers evaluate the recommended products through two experiments. Study 1 (n = 85, students) employed a 2 (shopping medium type: voice assistant vs. website) x 2 (interaction style: task-oriented vs. socially-oriented) between-subjects design lab experiment. Study 2 (n = 418, Mechanical Turk) employed a 2 (shopping medium type: voice assistant vs. website) x 2 (product type: search vs. experience) between-subjects online experiment. The results suggested that consumers may perceive voice assistants as pseudohuman agents detached from the service provider while perceiving websites as a tool or interface used by the provider, resulting in a more positive perception and evaluation of websites. As one of the few studies investigating voice assistants from the consumer perspective, this study contributes to the growing body of research in voice assistants. The study also contributes to anthropomorphism literature and parasocial interaction theory by confirming the causal relationship between humanlikeness and parasocial relationships.

Businesses have classically put emphasis on human bonds related to their BM's but by the fast development of more sensoring and persuasive BMs increasingly run autonomously by machines, businesses have to know how these BM's can be innovated and how they can be operated to ensure their full business potential and survival.
   BMES and BM's have for a longtime been based and built up with human bond communication, but this can vanish within split seconds when these new technologies very much based on machine to human communication evolves. How is and will this change the bonds between humans, humans and machines and machines to machines. How will this evolvement influence humans and machines ability to "sense", "relate" and "communicate" each other. The paper addresses the exponential development of artificial intelligence technologies, persuasive technologies and persuasive BMs in Business model innovation and introduce a conceptual model to future business model innovation and operation.

TI  - How effective are depictions of AI? Reflections from an experimental study in science communication
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
AB  - The images used to depict artificial intelligence (AI) in science communication and marketing are often criticized for their stereotypical nature, yet their actual effectiveness remains an open question. Rather than reiterating existing critiques, this paper examines whether these images truly influence public perception and, if so, how different types of AI representations-particularly stock images-compare in their effectiveness. Drawing on Aristotelian rhetoric, we conceptualize effectiveness through three persuasive dimensions: logos (explanatory clarity), ethos (credibility and engagement), and pathos (emotional impact). To investigate these aspects, we conducted an experiment with 79 communication students, who were presented with three versions of the same fabricated scientific article: one without images, one with an institutional research image, and one with a stock image. The findings indicate that while stock images may reduce comprehension of technical content, they slightly enhance reader engagement. Our analysis calls for a more nuanced understanding of AI imagery, moving beyond ethical concerns to consider how these visuals shape public discourse. While stock images contribute to a standardized and sometimes misleading portrayal of AI, their rhetorical power in communication contexts should not be overlooked. The paper concludes by arguing for a more critical yet balanced approach to evaluating the role of images in AI representation.

TI  - Evaluating AI-Personalized Learning Interventions in Distance Education
T2  - INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF RESEARCH IN OPEN AND DISTRIBUTED LEARNING
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving the persuasive communication skills of online Master of Business Administration (MBA) students. In particular, this study investigated the influence of personalization through AI using the Google Gemini platform on conventional and online instructional approaches. This quasi-experimental study used a pretest and posttest design to compare two groups of MBA students pursuing persuasive online communication. The experimental group (n = 32) interacted with the AI-based personalized learning materials, whereas the control group (n = 32) used standard instructor-designed online modules. During the 12-week intervention period, the experimental group was provided with customized practice activities. Conversely, the control group was offered conventional online learning material. The effectiveness of both approaches was evaluated using pretests and posttests. The results of Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test provided insight into the areas where AI-based personalized learning had a statistically significant impact. These results support the conclusions derived from an analysis of variance and further validate the study's research hypotheses. This study demonstrates the advantages of incorporating AI into language development for remote learners and offers valuable insights for integrating AI-driven technologies into distance education.

TI  - Examining artificial intelligence literacy among pre-service teachers for future classrooms
T2  - COMPUTERS AND EDUCATION OPEN
AB  - In the context of global integration and increasing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, evaluating the AI literacy of pre-service teachers is crucial. As future architects of educational systems, pre-service teachers must not only possess pedagogical expertise but also a strong foundation in AI literacy. This quantitative study examines AI literacy among 529 pre-service teachers in a Nigerian university, utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) for comprehensive analysis. The research explores various dimensions of AI literacy, revealing that a profound understanding of AI significantly predicts positive outcomes in AI use, detection, ethics, creation, and problem-solving. However, no correlation exists between AI knowledge and emotion regulation or the assumption that active AI use enhances AI detection capabilities. The study identifies a trade-off between AI application and creation, emphasizing the ethical considerations intertwined with emotional and persuasive facets of AI use. It also supports the link between AI creation and problem-solving, emphasizing the foundational role of AI knowledge in shaping diverse aspects of AI literacy among pre-service teachers. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, administrators, policymakers, and researchers aiming to enhance AI literacy in pre-service teacher education programs.

TI  - WHEN AND HOW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AUGMENTS EMPLOYEE CREATIVITY
T2  - ACADEMY OF MANAGEMENT JOURNAL
AB  - Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI-human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees' creativity in answering customers' questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees' interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills.

TI  - Process patents, gamification anduserand user protection from the Iramuteq software analysis
T2  - REVISTA TECNOLOGIA E SOCIEDADE
AB  - The new interactive technologies together with the development of artificial intelligence, have raised discussions not only for their transformations in society but also the search for understanding the protection not only of the organizations' intellectual property but also of the users they use. Protecting processes from technological innovations is important as well as protecting users. Authors such as Negroponte (1999), Pierre Levy (2009) and Yuval Harari (2018), help to understand these technical-social transformations and their impacts on society. This article aims to analyze the interrelationship between the viable ones: patents, processes, gamification and only user protection. Through the software IRAMUTEQ, with nine textual corpus (conclusions of articles), 50 text segments were used for analysis, of which 40 were considered to correspond to 74.67% of the data. The method used was exploratory descriptive with a qualitative approach. From the analyzed corpus, 6 classes were suggested, which were grouped into: General concepts, Process/Technology Patents and User Protection, the results confined the interrelationship between variables, that is, thus presenting the need for a debate on protection to users who are exposed to the increasing amount of technologies and innovations, developed with the purpose of modifying their behavior. This study seeks to contribute to the reflection on the importance of building a vision as well as policies on user protection that are increasingly involved in technologies and innovations that seek behavior change.

TI  - Defending Truth and Democracy in the Age of AI: A Framework for Empowering Voters Against Persuasion and Misinformation with AI Literacy
T2  - ADCOMUNICA-REVISTA CIENTIFICA DE ESTRATEGIAS TENDENCIAS E INNOVACION EN COMMUNICACION
AB  - Witnessing the rising impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a post-truth envi-ronment, our senses' credibility wanes as the distinction between the real and the imagined becomes increasingly hazy. This study examines AI-generated content and deepfakes' effects on voters by analyzing their use in Turkish and American politics over the past decade. The ease and speed of creating fake news with AI necessitate constant verification, yet regulation is often lacking, heightening daily anxiety about reality. With the EU's imminent AI law, this article highlights the dangers of media advocacy (the strategic use of media to influence public opinion) and misinformation (spreading incorrect or misleading information). Through a meticulous literature review, press release analysis, and case studies, the study assesses their possible persuasive impact on voters, elections, and democracy. It identifies the associated risks and proposes a framework to empower voters using technology to reinforce "truth filters," Intelligence Augmentation, and "AI litera-cy." Two concepts that were developed side by side, but with different intentions, while AI aimed to create digital intelligence, Intelligence Augmentation focused instead on using technology to enhance the human capacity

TI  - An implantable memristor towards biomedical applications
T2  - APPLIED MATERIALS TODAY
AB  - As a new type of two-terminal nonlinear nanoelectronic component, memristors have shown significant application prospects in the post Moore's electron era, as they can store and process data in a single cell, further realizing brain-like neuromorphic computing modes and providing hardware support for the development of super artificial intelligence. However, whether memristors can be applied in the biomedical field to achieve information sensing for human-machine interaction is still a research gap. Herein, we demonstrate a ZrOx filmbased flexible memristor, which shows promising applications as an implantable device. In particular, the working mechanisms of the implantable memristor were comprehensively analyzed, in which it has been found that the memristive behavior of the device is mainly determined by carrier tunneling. Reliable electron tunneling parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data, which provides persuasive supporting for the research of tunneling devices. Furthermore, the memristive behavior of the device is closely related to space charge limited current (SCLC) under bending conditions. Finally, the biomedical and human-machine interaction applications can be achieved based on the implantable memristor. This work not only proves the application feasibility of flexible memristor in the field of implantable biomedicine, but also promotes the rapid development of human-machine interaction.

TI  - Can ChatGPT be a debate partner? Developing ChatGPT-based application "DEBO" for debate education, findings and limitations
T2  - EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY & SOCIETY
AB  - Debate is a universally acknowledged competency for its vital role in fostering essential skills such as analytical reasoning, eloquent communication, and persuasive argument construction. This is relevant in both formal educational settings like classrooms and informal venues such as after-school clubs. Traditional debate training methods often face challenges in facilitating personalized learning, primarily due to the difficulty of securing a debate partner. However, the emerging field of generative AI offers a promising alternative. This study evaluates the effectiveness of DEBO, a debate education application that utilizes ChatGPT, an advanced language model by OpenAI. Focusing on university students actively involved in a debate club, six volunteers tested DEBO and participated in interviews to provide insights. The findings reveal that DEBO notably enhances divergent thinking and features a comprehensive analytics dashboard for in-depth performance analysis. However, there are few limitations including occasional shortcomings in debate quality, minor inaccuracies, and the need for faster response times. The study underscores the transformative potential of advanced language models like ChatGPT in reshaping debate education, while also identifying areas for further improvement.

TI  - Using Argument Features to Improve the Argumentation Process
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF ARGUMENT
CP  - 6th International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA)
AB  - Argumentation has become an important topic in artificial intelligence; the basic idea is to identify arguments in favor and against a statement, select the acceptable ones, and determine whether the original statement can be accepted or not. However, the arguments involved in an argumentative discussion may have different relevance degrees; for this reason, argumentation frameworks need to represent the qualities that describe the soundness of an argument in order to refine the acceptability process performed over the argumentation model.

TI  - Gamification in Physical Activity: State-of-the-Art
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB  - activity is decreasing globally, and more people are becoming sedentary, which is associated with numerous adverse health outcomes. To counter this trend, gamification emerges as a promising strategy for enhancing participation in physical activity interventions. The review investigates the influence of gamified systems on the promotion of physical activity and examines associated behavioral and psychological outcomes. The analysis incorporates empirical studies focused on adult participants, published in peer-reviewed English-language journals over the last five years. Several critical aspects are considered in the analysis, including specific types of physical activity targeted, employed gamification systems, involved motivational features, and behavioral and psychological outcomes, thus offering a state-of-the-art overview of gamification and physical activity. Findings confirm that gamification serves as an effective mechanism for promoting physical activity. To address gaps in existing research, recommendations for future work include broadening the range of metrics used for measuring physical activity and investigating the psychological benefits of gamification in physical activity interventions. Moreover, future research could benefit from leveraging addictive game design elements and utilizing artificial intelligence and computer vision models to monitor user progress and suggest appropriate challenges. In conclusion, the review outlines the considerable potential of gamification to positively affect participation in physical activity, highlighting the need for additional research to fully realize this potential.

TI  - Fired by an algorithm? Exploration of conformism with biased intelligent decision support systems in the context of workplace discipline
T2  - CAREER DEVELOPMENT INTERNATIONAL
AB  - Purpose The importance of artificial intelligence in human resource management has grown substantially. Previous literature discusses the advantages of AI implementation at a workplace and its various consequences, often hostile, for employees. However, there is little empirical research on the topic. The authors address this gap by studying if individuals oppose biased algorithm recommendations regarding disciplinary actions in an organisation. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted an exploratory experiment in which the authors evaluated 76 subjects over a set of 5 scenarios in which a biased algorithm gave strict recommendations regarding disciplinary actions at a workplace. Findings The authors' results suggest that biased suggestions from intelligent agents can influence individuals who make disciplinary decisions. Social implications The authors' results contribute to the ongoing debate on applying AI solutions to HR problems. The authors demonstrate that biased algorithms may substantially change how employees are treated and show that human conformity towards intelligent decision support systems is broader than expected. Originality/value The authors' paper is among the first to show that people may accept recommendations that provoke moral dilemmas, bring adverse outcomes, or harm employees. The authors introduce the problem of "algorithmic conformism" and discuss its consequences for HRM.

TI  - Persuasive Technology and computational manipulation: hypernudging out of mental self-determination
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Artificial Intelligence, unperceived, can acquire the user's data, find connections not visible by a human being, profile the users, and aim at persuading them, resulting in Persuasive Technology (PT). During the persuasive process, PT can use manipulation, finding and using routes to affect System 1, the primordial brain of individuals, in the absence of their awareness, undermining their decision-making processes. Multiple international and European bodies recognized that AI systems could use manipulation at an unprecedented degree via second-generation dark patterns such as the hypernudge and that computational manipulation constitutes a risk for autonomy and different, overlapping, fundamental rights such as privacy, informational self-determination and freedom of thought. However, there is a lack of shared ideas regarding which fundamental rights are violated by computational manipulation and which fundamental rights can protect individuals against it. The right to be let alone and the right to hold and express a thought differ from the right to create a thought, being in control of the decision-making process and free from cognitive interferences operated by computational manipulation. Therefore, this paper argues in favor of recognizing a newly emerged fundamental right, the right to mental self-determination, tailored to the unprecedented abilities of AI-driven manipulative technologies.

TI  - AI-Empowered Persuasive Video Generation: A Survey
T2  - ACM COMPUTING SURVEYS
AB  - Promotional videos are rapidly becoming a popularmedium for persuading people to change their behaviours in many settings (e.g., online shopping, social enterprise initiatives). Today, such videos are often produced by professionals, which is a time-, labour- and cost-intensive undertaking. In order to produce such contents to support large applications (e.g., e-commerce), the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered persuasive video generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is interdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to grasp. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey of AIPVG available. In this paper, we bridge this gap by reviewing key AI techniques that can be utilized to automatically generate persuasive videos. We offer a first-of-its-kind taxonomy which divides AIPVG into three major steps: (1) visual material understanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs) relevant to the target of promotion; (2) visual storyline generation, which shortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a storyline with persuasive power; and (3) post-production, which involves background music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing experience. We also introduce the evaluation metrics and datasets commonly adopted in the field of AIPVG. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the existing works belonging to the above-mentioned steps, and discuss interesting potential future research directions.

TI  - THE USE OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ELECTION CAMPAIGNS AND ITS DEMOCRATIC EFFECTS
T2  - REVISTA DE DERECHO POLITICO
AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in election campaigns is significantly transforming the political and democratic landscape. AI has introduced new dynamics into electoral processes, impacting the way campaigns are conducted, which can pose a threat to the integrity of democratic systems. Technological innovations affect the way election campaigns are managed and executed. From traditional media such as radio, television and film, to digital platforms, technological evolution has enabled greater personalization and effectiveness in political communication. AI facilitates the analysis of large volumes of data, enabling highly segmented and personalized campaigns. At the same time, technological threats are a growing concern for democracy. Data manipulation, false profiling and cyber-attacks are some of the risks faced by electoral processes. These practices can affect the transparency and fairness of elections, compromising basic principles such as the freedom to vote. Digitalization amplifies both information and disinformation. Political propaganda has become more sophisticated, using AI techniques to create and disseminate disinformative content more effectively. This phenomenon contributes to the fragmentation and polarization of public opinion and can erode trust in the democratic process and institutions. AI is used to improve the persuasiveness and determent of political parties and candidates. It allows the creation of more sophisticated communication strategies and the optimization of electoral resources. However, it also poses ethical and practical challenges, such as manipulation of reality through deepfakes and extreme segmentation of the electorate. Responses to the challenges posed by AI in the electoral field have been diverse. Some technology platforms have adopted self-regulatory measures, such as tagging AI-generated content. However, self-regulation has proved to be insufficient, and a more robust legislative response is required to protect the integrity of electoral processes. In some countries, laws prohibiting the use of deepfakes in election campaigns have already been implemented. AI offers both opportunities and risks, and its impact on democracy depends on how its applications are managed and its negative effects mitigated. It is crucial to establish clear national and international regulatory framework covering the use of AI in electoral campaigns. This framework must ensure transparency, fairness and protection of electoral rights. Collaboration between governments, electoral institutions, technology companies and civil society is essential to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of democratic processes in the digital era.

TI  - Primary Prevention of Sudden Cardiac Death of the Young Athlete: The Controversy About the Screening Electrocardiogram and Its Innovative Artificial Intelligence Solution
T2  - PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY
AB  - The preparticipation screening for athlete participation in sports typically entails a comprehensive medical and family history and a complete physical examination. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can increase the likelihood of detecting cardiac diagnoses such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this diagnostic test as part of the screening process has engendered considerable controversy. The pro position is supported by argument that international screening protocols support its use, positive diagnosis has multiple benefits, history and physical examination are inadequate, primary prevention is essential, and the cost effectiveness is justified. Although the aforementioned myriad of justifications for routine ECG screening of young athletes can be persuasive, several valid contentions oppose supporting such a policy, namely, that the sudden death incidence is very (too) low, the ECG screening will be too costly, the false-positive rate is too high, resources will be allocated away from other diseases, and manpower is insufficient for its execution. Clinicians, including pediatric cardiologists, have an understandable proclivity for avoiding this prodigious national endeavor. The controversy, however, should not be focused on whether an inexpensive, noninvasive test such as an ECG should be mandated but should instead be directed at just how these tests for young athletes can be performed in the clinical imbroglio of these disease states (with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression) with concomitant fiscal accountability and logistical expediency in this era of economic restraint. This monumental endeavor in any city or region requires two crucial elements well known to business scholars: implementation and execution. The eventual solution for the screening ECG dilemma requires a truly innovative and systematic approach that will liberate us from inadequate conventional solutions. Artificial intelligence, specifically the process termed "machine learning" and "neural networking," involves complex algorithms that allow computers to improve the decision-making process based on repeated input of empirical data (e. g., databases and ECGs). These elements all can be improved with a national database, evidence-based medicine, and in the near future, innovation that entails a Kurzweilian artificial intelligence infrastructure with machine learning and neural networking that will construct the ultimate clinical decision-making algorithm.

T2  - JOURNAL OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Objectives: To describe the degree of automation in just-in-time, adaptive interventions (JITAIs) assessed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any medical specialty, and to assess the completeness of intervention reporting.Study Design and Setting: Systematic scoping reviewdwe searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, from 1 January 2019 to 2 March 2021, for reports of RCTs assessing JITAIs. We assessed whether study reports included the minimum information required to replicate the interventions based on JITAI frameworks. We described JITAIs according to their automation level using an established framework (partially, highly, or fully automated), and care workload distribution (requiring work from patients, health care professionals [HCPs], both, or neither).Results: We included 88 JITAIs (62%, n = 55 supported chronic illness management and 12%, n = 11 supported health behavior change). Overall, 77% (n = 68) of JITAIs were missing some information required to replicate the intervention (e.g., n = 38, 43% inadequately reported the algorithm used to select intervention components). Only fifteen (17%) JITAIs were fully automated and did not require additional work from HCPs nor patients. Of the remaining JITAIs, 36% required work from both patients and HCPs, and 47% required work from either patients or HCPs.Conclusion: Most JITAIs are not fully automated and require work from the HCPs and patients.

TI  - Pain Management Mobile Applications: A Systematic Review of Commercial and Research Efforts
T2  - SENSORS
AB  - Shared decision making is crucial in the pain domain. The subjective nature of pain demands solutions that can facilitate pain assessment and management. The aim of the current study is to review the current trends in both the commercial and the research domains in order to reveal the key issues and guidelines that could further help in the effective development of pain-focused apps. We searched for scientific publications and commercial apps in 22 databases and the two major app stores. Out of 3612 articles and 336 apps, 69 met the requirements for inclusion following the PRISMA guidelines. An analysis of their features (technological approach, design methodology, evaluation strategy, and others) identified critical points that have to be taken into consideration in future efforts. For example, commercial and research efforts target different types of pain, while no participatory design is followed in the majority of the cases examined. Moreover, the evaluation of the final apps remains a challenge that hinders their success. The examined domain is expected to experience a substantial increase. More research is needed towards the development of non-intrusive wearables and sensors for pain detection and assessment, along with artificial intelligence techniques and open data.

AB  - Power distance (PD), a cultural value denoting acceptance of asymmetrical power relationships, influences the force of rhetoric used by a writer to address their reader. However, AI technologies such as ChatGPT lack an explicit awareness of PD, which could affect the quality of AI-generated persuasive texts used for language learning. To investigate this issue, 200 persuasive essays written by ChatGPT were compared to 200 essays written by L1-English university learners. Three elements of formulaic language related to PD were examined: stances, modals, and pronoun deixis. Differences in stances (z = -3.411; p = .001) and modals (z = -2.100; p = .036) were both significant according to the Wilcoxon signed ranks formula, whereas differences in pronoun deixis were nearly significant (z = -1.917; p = .055). Overall, language of ChatGPT appears generic and incomplete, suggesting that consistent and uniform expressions are being borrowed from an LLM training corpus to mimic aspects of PD. Limitations of AI highlight a need for pedagogical emphasis of culturally imbued discourse.

TI  - Do Tourists Prefer Dialectal Service? The Role of Processing Fluency, Distinctiveness, and Cultural Learning Cues
T2  - JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH
AB  - Serving tourists in dialect can be a double-edged sword, as the literature acknowledges it may hamper language processing fluency while offering a sense of distinctiveness for tourists. Building on Two-Factor Theory of Emotion, this research contributes to the literature by articulating a paradoxical process in which dialectal service can be internalized as both an enabling and an inhibiting factor in understanding a local culture. It further proposes a facilitating mechanism through cultural learning cues. We conducted three empirical experiments (Studies 1-3), followed by an external validation process through generative AI (Study 4), and finally employed methodological triangulation through semistructured interviews (Study 5). Through the explanatory lens of sequential mixed methods, the current inquiry further illuminates why and how dialects can add flavor to one's travel by spicing up the cultural appeals of a place in such a way that can replace a bitter pill with an enjoyable reminiscence.

TI  - Feasibility of Using an Artificial Intelligence-based Telephone Application for Dietary Assessment and Nudging to Improve the Quality of Food Choices of Female Adolescents in Vietnam: Evidence from a Randomized Pilot Study
T2  - CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN NUTRITION
AB  - Background: Adolescent nutrition has faced a policy neglect, partly owing to the gaps in dietary intake data for this age group. The Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights (FRANI) is a smartphone application validated for dietary assessment and to in fl uence users toward healthy food choices. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the feasibility (adherence, acceptability, and usability) of FRANI and its effects on food choices and diet quality in female adolescents in Vietnam. Methods: Adolescents ( N = 36) were randomly selected from a public school and allocated into 2 groups. The control group received smartphones with a version of FRANI limited to dietary assessment, whereas the intervention received smartphones with gami fi ed FRANI. After the fi rst 4 wk, both groups used gami fi ed FRANI for further 2 wk. The primary outcome was the feasibility of using FRANI as measured by adherence (the proportion of completed food records), acceptability and usability (the proportion of participants who considered FRANI acceptable and usable according to answers of a Likert questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included the percentage of meals recorded, the Minimum Dietary Diversity for Women (MDDW) and the Eat-Lancet Diet Score (ELDS). Dietary diversity is important for dietary quality, and sustainable healthy diets are important to reduce carbon emissions. Poisson regression models were used to estimate the effect of gami fi ed FRANI on the MDDW and ELDS. Results: Adherence to the application was 82% and the percentage of meals recorded was 97%. Acceptability and usability were 97%. MDDW in the intervention group was 1.07 points (95% CI: 0.98, 1.18; P = 0.13) greater than that in the control (constant = 4.68); however, the difference was not statistically signi fi cant. Moreover, ELDS in the intervention was 1.09 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.18; P = 0.03) points greater than in the control (constant = 3.67). Conclusions: FRANI was feasible and may be effective to in fl uence users toward healthy food choices. Research is needed for FRANI in different contexts and at scale. The trial was registered at the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number as ISRCTN 10681553.

TI  - Algorithms as conversational partners: Looking at Google auto-predict through the lens of symbolic interaction
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB  - This article showcases a speculative methodology for recreating interactions between a human and Google Search's Auto-Predict interface as conversations, to explore how AI-based systems are both persuasive and deeply personal. Using ethnomethodology tools and a symbolic interactionist lens, the paper presents three versions of a single Google search, each variation building a slightly different angle on the plausible utterances and interpersonal dynamics of the human and nonhuman partners. This thought experiment emerges from a decade of classroom-based digital literacy exercises with young adults, training them to analyze their lived experiences with digital media, algorithms, and devices. Transforming information exchanges into personal conversations provides a creative method for analyzing how relations are co-constructed in the granular processes of interaction, through which mutual intelligibility is built, meaning about the world is made, and identities are formed. This critical analysis extends methods for human-machine communication studies and elaborates notions of algorithmic identity.

TI  - Sustainability Disclosure in Integrated Reporting: Does It Matter to Investors? A Cheap Talk Approach
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the value-relevance of corporate sustainability disclosure through integrated reporting. Sustainability disclosure is subject to managers' discretion. Besides, it is often hardly verifiable. In this respect, integrated reporting could provide the means for a verifiable disclosure, otherwise, in the jargon of game theory, it could be considered as a cheap talk. This paper investigates which of these hypotheses is most likely to occur in reality. In order to do this, a simple theoretical framework is introduced, where sustainability of corporate performances is modelled as a tail-risk for shareholders. Costless signaling games (cheap talk) and persuasion games are reviewed within this context, in order to derive competing theories of sustainability disclosure's value relevance through integrated reporting. These alternative theories are tested empirically consistent with the theoretical framework presented, in order to identify key-parameters. In this respect, a systematic textual analysis (artificial intelligence) of integrated reports was employed as to build a synthetic measure of sustainability disclosure. The application of this methodology on a sample of European listed companies showed that sustainability disclosure through integrated reporting has no effect on market-valuations, confirming the null hypothesis of integrated reporting resulting in a cheap talk's babbling equilibrium.

TI  - Personality-based tailored explainable recommendation for trustworthy smart learning system in the age of artificial intelligence
T2  - SMART LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS
AB  - In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), trust in AI systems is becoming more important. Explainable recommenders, which explain why an item is recommended, have recently been proposed in the field of learning technology to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, the methods for generating explanations are limited and do not consider the learner's cognitive perceptions or personality. This study draws inspiration from tailored intervention research in public health and investigates the effectiveness of personality-based tailored explanations by implementing them for the recommended quizzes in an explainable recommender system. High school students (n = 217) were clustered into three distinct profiles labeled Diligent (n = 77), Fearful (n = 72), and Agreeable (n = 68), based on the Big Five personality traits. The students were divided into a tailored intervention group (n = 106) and a control group (n = 111). In the tailored intervention group, personalized explanations for recommended quizzes were provided based on student profiles, with explanations based on quiz characteristics. In the control group, only non-personalized explanations based on quiz characteristics were provided. An 18-day A/B experiment showed that the tailored intervention group had significantly higher recommendation usage than the control group. These results suggest that personality-based tailored explanations with a recommender approach are effective for e-learning engagement and imply improved trustworthiness of AI learning systems.

TI  - From Didachography to AI: Metaphors Teaching is Automated by
T2  - JOURNAL OF INTERACTIVE MEDIA IN EDUCATION
AB  - Although automation is not a novelty, high hopes are currently pinned on more and more ingenious devices built with Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has become a key discussion point in the agendas of governments and multinational agencies, with particular interest in educational applications. This article explores parallels between ideas surrounding AI in education and conceptions proposed in the 17th century by Jan Amos Comenius, known as the father of modern education. Drawing upon illustrations from ongoing research that takes metaphor as its core analytical category, the piece assumes that metaphors are not mere stylistic elements, but strategic persuasive devices. Comenius' didachography, a portmanteau coined in his 1657 Didactica Magna to describe an inclusive educational system, relies heavily on metaphors that suggest remarkable similarities with contemporary EdTech rhetoric, especially on AI -related developments. Whilst exemplifying that ideas and premises entailed in current discourses on EdTech may hark back to centuries-old ideas, the paper argues that, despite taking on varying, contextually situated linguistic expressions, underlying metaphors appear to have endured from Comenius' time to support the advent of an educational system poised to automate teaching and, thus, dispense with a key part of his scheme: the teacher. In closing, the piece suggests that we may need to acknowledge the contingent nature of teaching and learning, perhaps accepting that key aspects of what makes us human may always resist engineering.

TI  - Navigating the design of simulated exercising peers: insights from a participatory design study
T2  - FRONTIERS IN DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Background To fight sedentary lifestyles, researchers have introduced various technological interventions aimed at promoting physical activity through social support. These interventions encourage people to exercise together, maintaining high levels of motivation. However, the unpredictable nature of human peers makes it challenging to control behavior and balance these interventions effectively. Artificial intelligence agents, on the other hand, can provide consistent social support and are more controllable. Hence, we propose Simulated Exercising Peers (SEPs) as a promising solution for providing agent-based social support for physical activity.Method Participatory design sessions were conducted, involving young adults in the creation of SEP-based interventions. Sixteen participants generated four prototypes that varied in aesthetics, behavior, and communication style, with outcomes analyzed through the lens of Self-Determination Theory to better understand the motivational implications of each design.Results Findings highlight key components crucial for designing SEPs that enhance acceptance and efficiently integrate into physical activity interventions. Additionally, the study revealed how the aesthetics and behavior of SEPs could potentially deceive users, which can lead to user disengagement from interventions involving SEPs. Participants also defined two distinct social roles for the SEPs, i.e., coach, and companion, each associated with unique communication styles.Conclusion This study offers five design guidelines for the development of SEPs, AI agents aimed at promoting physical activity through social support, and highlights opportunities for their integration into broader physical activity interventions.

TI  - Design of a randomized controlled trial comparing a mobile phone-based hypertension health coaching application to home blood pressure monitoring alone: The Smart Hypertension Control Study
T2  - CONTEMPORARY CLINICAL TRIALS
AB  - Background: Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality but frequently remains uncontrolled. A smartphone application that provides coaching regarding home blood pressure monitoring and other aspects of hypertension self-care and related behavior change may be a scalable way to help manage hypertension.
   Methods/design: The Smart Hypertension Control Study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a hypertension personal control program (HPCP), which consists of an automated artificial intelligence smartphone application that provides individualized support and coaching to promote home monitoring and healthy behavior changes related to hypertension self-management. Enrolled adults with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the HPCP with home blood pressure monitoring or to home monitoring alone. We plan to enroll 350 participants, with a target of 300 participants with complete six-month follow-up data. The primary study outcome will be systolic blood pressure at six months. Additional outcomes include measures of antihypertensive medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring practices, self-management practices, weight, and self-reported health behaviors.
   Conclusion: The Smart Hypertension Control Study will evaluate blood pressure and hypertension self-management behavior outcomes in participants with uncontrolled hypertension exposed to a smartphone-based hypertension health coaching application in addition to home blood pressure monitoring compared to those exposed to home blood pressure monitoring alone.

TI  - Digital Technologies as Enablers of the Circular Economy: An Empirical Perspective on the Role of Companies in Driving Customer Behaviour Change
T2  - R & D MANAGEMENT
AB  - The circular economy concept has gained significant attention in the academic and industrial discourse. Yet, the widespread adoption of circular business models is still outstanding, with a lack of customer acceptance representing a critical barrier. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the potential of digital technologies to expedite the circular economy's broader implementation. This study investigates the role of digital technologies in enhancing customer acceptance of circular business models in consumer-facing industries. To extract insights from practice, we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews with experts from companies that have implemented circular economy principles, management consulting firms, and academia. As a result, we provide thematical structures of (1) 35 factors affecting customer acceptance of circular business models, (2) 36 practices that organizations can deploy to address these factors and enhance customer acceptance, and (3) 19 digital technologies to facilitate such practices. Our findings combine and extend insights from the distinct research streams of behavioral science and theory of digital technology management by adding a technology dimension to the behavior change wheel, highlighting the interplay between sources of behavior (factors), intervention functions (practices), and technological enablers (digital technologies). This extended framework will support researchers investigating the role of digital technologies and inform companies about the use of digital technologies in circular business model innovation as an enabler of customer acceptance.

TI  - Effects of customer inoculation on artificial intelligence service failure
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTEMPORARY HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to explore the effectiveness of customer inoculation strategies in the context of AI service failures in the hospitality and tourism industries. Furthermore, it examines how these strategies can enhance customer complaint behavior and satisfaction with service recovery, thereby improving the overall service experience.Design/methodology/approachFour distinct studies were conducted: Study 1 investigated the influence of customer inoculation on complaint behavior post-AI service failure. Study 2 assessed the impact of service remedies on customer satisfaction. Study 3 explored the implications of initial purchase and usage intentions. Finally, Study 4 validated the findings using a large-scale online survey.FindingsThe results indicated that customer inoculation significantly increases customer complaint behavior and satisfaction with service remedies following AI service failures. They also showed that this relationship is mediated by psychological distance. Furthermore, customer inoculation positively affects initial purchase and usage intentions, demonstrating effectiveness at various customer engagement stages.Practical implicationsThis study enriches the literature on AI hospitality service failure and recovery by introducing the novel concept of customer inoculation. Additionally, it significantly contributes to the inoculation theory literature, which covers diverse fields. Practically, this study proposes an efficient and low-cost strategy for marketers.Originality/valueThis study introduces the concept of customer inoculation in the context of AI service failures, a novel approach in the hospitality and tourism literature. It provides empirical evidence of the efficacy of the strategy, bridging a crucial gap in understanding customer behavior in the face of technological disruptions.

TI  - Engagement with mHealth Alcohol Interventions: User Perspectives on an App or Chatbot-Delivered Program to Reduce Drinking
T2  - HEALTHCARE
AB  - Research suggests participant engagement is a key mediator of mHealth alcohol interventions' effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption among users. Understanding the features that promote engagement is critical to maximizing the effectiveness of mHealth-delivered alcohol interventions. The purpose of this study was to identify facilitators and barriers to mHealth alcohol intervention utilization among hazardous-drinking participants who were randomized to use either an app (Step Away) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot-based intervention for reducing drinking (the Step Away chatbot). We conducted semi-structured interviews from December 2019 to January 2020 with 20 participants who used the app or chatbot for three months, identifying common facilitators and barriers to use. Participants of both interventions reported that tracking their drinking, receiving feedback about their drinking, feeling held accountable, notifications about high-risk drinking times, and reminders to track their drinking promoted continued engagement. Positivity, personalization, gaining insight into their drinking, and daily tips were stronger facilitator themes among bot users, indicating these may be strengths of the AI chatbot-based intervention when compared to a user-directed app. While tracking drinking was a theme among both groups, it was more salient among app users, potentially due to the option to quickly track drinks in the app that was not present with the conversational chatbot. Notification glitches, technology glitches, and difficulty with tracking drinking data were usage barriers for both groups. Lengthy setup processes were a stronger barrier for app users. Repetitiveness of the bot conversation, receipt of non-tailored daily tips, and inability to self-navigate to desired content were reported as barriers by bot users. To maximize engagement with AI interventions, future developers should include tracking to reinforce behavior change self-monitoring and be mindful of repetitive conversations, lengthy setup, and pathways that limit self-directed navigation.

TI  - A review of AI and Data Science support for cancer management
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE
AB  - Introduction: Thanks to improvement of care, cancer has become a chronic condition. But due to the toxicity of treatment, the importance of supporting the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients increases. Monitoring and managing QoL relies on data collected by the patient in his/her home environment, its integration, and its analysis, which supports personalization of cancer management recommendations. We review the state-of-the-art of computerized systems that employ AI and Data Science methods to monitor the health status and provide support to cancer patients managed at home.
   Objective: Our main objective is to analyze the literature to identify open research challenges that a novel decision support system for cancer patients and clinicians will need to address, point to potential solutions, and provide a list of established best-practices to adopt.
   Methods: We designed a review study, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing studies retrieved from PubMed related to monitoring cancer patients in their home environments via sensors and self-reporting: what data is collected, what are the techniques used to collect data, semantically integrate it, infer the patient's state from it and deliver coaching/behavior change interventions.
   Results: Starting from an initial corpus of 819 unique articles, a total of 180 papers were considered in the full-text analysis and 109 were finally included in the review. Our findings are organized and presented in four main sub-topics consisting of data collection, data integration, predictive modeling and patient coaching.
   Conclusion: Development of modern decision support systems for cancer needs to utilize best practices like the use of validated electronic questionnaires for quality-of-life assessment, adoption of appropriate information modeling standards supplemented by terminologies/ontologies, adherence to FAIR data principles, external validation, stratification of patients in subgroups for better predictive modeling, and adoption of formal behavior change theories. Open research challenges include supporting emotional and social dimensions of well-being, including PROs in predictive modeling, and providing better customization of behavioral interventions for the specific population of cancer patients.

TI  - Risky business: a scoping review for communicating results of predictive models between providers and patients
T2  - JAMIA OPEN
AB  - Objective Given widespread excitement around predictive analytics and the proliferation of machine learning algorithms that predict outcomes, a key next step is understanding how this information is-or should be-communicated with patients. Materials and Methods We conducted a scoping review informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines to identify current knowledge and gaps in this domain. Results Ten studies met inclusion criteria for full text review. The following topics were represented in the studies, some of which involved more than 1 topic: disease prevention (N = 5/10, 50%), treatment decisions (N = 5/10, 50%), medication harms reduction (N = 1/10, 10%), and presentation of cardiovascular risk information (N = 5/10, 50%). A single study included 6- and 12-month clinical outcome metrics. Discussion As predictive models are increasingly published, marketed by industry, and implemented, this paucity of relevant research poses important gaps. Published studies identified the importance of (1) identifying the most effective source of information for patient communications; (2) contextualizing risk information and associated design elements based on users' needs and problem areas; and (3) understanding potential impacts on risk factor modification and behavior change dependent on risk presentation. Conclusion An opportunity remains for researchers and practitioners to share strategies for effective selection of predictive algorithms for clinical practice, approaches for educating clinicians and patients in effectively using predictive data, and new approaches for framing patient-provider communication in the era of artificial intelligence.

TI  - Mental Wellness Self-Care in Singapore With mindline.sg: A Tutorial on the Development of a Digital Mental Health Platform for Behavior Change
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Singapore, like the rest of Asia, faces persistent challenges to mental health promotion, including stigma around unwellness and seeking treatment and a lack of trained mental health personnel. The COVID-19 pandemic, which created a surge in mental health care needs and simultaneously accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions, revealed a new opportunity to quickly scale innovative solutions in the region. Objective: In June 2020, the Singaporean government launched mindline.sg, an anonymous digital mental health resource website that has grown to include >500 curated local mental health resources, a clinically validated self -assessment tool for depression and anxiety, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot from Wysa designed to deliver digital therapeutic exercises, and a tailored version of the website for working adults called mindline at work. The goal of the platform is to empower Singapore residents to take charge of their own mental health and to be able to offer basic support to those around them through the ease and convenience of a barrier -free digital solution. Methods: Website use is measured through click -level data analytics captured via Google Analytics and custom application programming interfaces, which in turn drive a customized analytics infrastructure based on the open -source platforms Titanium Database and Metabase. Unique, nonbounced (users that do not immediately navigate away from the site), engaged, and return users are reported. Results: In the 2 years following launch (July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022), the website received >447,000 visitors (approximately 15% of the target population of 3 million), 62.02% (277,727/447,783) of whom explored the site or engaged with resources (referred to as nonbounced visitors); 10.54% (29,271/277,727) of those nonbounced visitors returned. The most popular features on the platform were the dialogue -based therapeutic exercises delivered by the chatbot and the self -assessment tool, which were used by 25.54% (67,626/264,758) and 11.69% (32,469/277,727) of nonbounced visitors. On mindline at work, the rates of nonbounced visitors who engaged extensively (ie, spent >= 40 seconds exploring resources) and who returned were 51.56% (22,474/43,588) and 13.43% (5,853/43,588) over a year, respectively, compared to 30.9% (42,829/138,626) and 9.97% (13,822/138,626), respectively, on the generic mindline.sg site in the same year. Conclusions: The site has achieved desired reach and has seen a strong growth rate in the number of visitors, which required substantial and sustained digital marketing campaigns and strategic outreach partnerships. The site was careful to preserve anonymity, limiting the detail of analytics. The good levels of overall adoption encourage us to believe that mild to moderate mental health conditions and the social factors that underly them are amenable to digital interventions. While mindline.sg was primarily used in Singapore, we believe that similar solutions with local customization are widely and globally applicable.

TI  - A Self-Efficacy Theory-Based Study on the Teachers' Readiness to Teach Artificial Intelligence in Public Schools in Sri Lanka
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTING EDUCATION
AB  - Objectives. This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies. Participants. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article. Study Method. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers' readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers' self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach. Findings. This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers' self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers' self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers' own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum. Conclusions. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government's teacher training initiatives.

TI  - TESCREAL hallucinations: Psychedelic and AI hype as inequality engines
T2  - JOURNAL OF PSYCHEDELIC STUDIES
AB  - Background and Aims: While many scholars have called attention to similarities between the earlier SSRI hype and the ongoing hype for psychedelic medications, the rhetoric of psychedelic hype is tinged with utopian and esoteric aspirations that have no parallel in the discourse surrounding SSRIs or other antidepressants. This utopian discourse provides insight into the ways that global tech elites are instrumentalizing both psychedelics and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools in a broader world-building project that justifies increasing material inequality. If realized, this project would undermine the use of both tools for prosocial and pro-environmental outcomes. Methods: My argument develops through rhetorical analysis of the ways that industry leaders envision the future of medicalized psychedelics in their public communications. I draw on examples from media interviews, blog posts, podcasts, and press releases to underscore the persuasive strategies and ideological commitments that are driving the movement to transform psychedelics into pharmaceutical medications. Results: Counterfactual efforts to improve mental health by increasing inequality are widespread in the psychedelics industry. These efforts have been propelled by an elitist worldview that is widely-held in Silicon Valley. The backbone of this worldview is the TESCREAL bundle of ideologies, which describes an interrelated cluster of belief systems: transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism. Conclusions: This article demonstrates that TESCREALism is a driving force in major segments of the psychedelic pharmaceutical industry, where it is influencing the design of extractive systems that directly contradict the field's world-healing aspirations. These findings contribute to a developing subfield of critical psychedelic studies, which interrogates the political and economic implications of psychedelic medicalization.

TI  - The Problem of AI Hallucination and How to Solve It
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 23RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON E-LEARNING, ECEL 2024
CP  - 23rd European Conference on e-Learning
AB  - AI in education is a topic that has been researched for the last 70 years. However, the last two years have seen very significant changes. These changes relate to the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model has dramatically influenced how the public approaches artificial intelligence. For many, generative language models have become synonymous with AI and have come uncritically viewed as a universal source of answers to most questions. However, it soon became apparent that even generative language models had their limits. Among the main problems that emerged was hallucination (providing answers containing false or misleading information), which is expected in all language models. The main problem of hallucination is that this information is difficult to distinguish from other information, and AI language models are very persuasive in presenting it. The risks of this phenomenon are much more substantial when using language modules to support learning, where the learner cannot distinguish correct information from incorrect information. The proposed paper focuses on the area of AI hallucination in mathematics education. It will first show how AI chatbots hallucinate in mathematics and then present one possible solution to counter this hallucination. The presented solution was created for the AI chatbot Edu-AI and designed to tutor students in mathematics. Usually, the problem is approached so that the system verifies the correctness of the output offered by the chatbot. Within the Edu-AI, checking responses is not implemented, but checking inputs is. If an input containing a factual query is recorded, it is redirected, and the answer is traced to authorised knowledge sources and study materials. If a relevant answer cannot be traced in these sources, a redirect to a natural person who will address the question is offered. In addition to describing the technical solution, the article includes concrete examples of how the system works. This solution has been developed for the educational domain but applies to all domains where users must be provided with relevant information.

AB  - Businesses have classically put emphasis on human bonds related to their BM's [ www. conansence. org]. By the fast development of more sensoring, persuasive and virtual BMs increasingly run autonomously by machines, businesses should expect to be able to, build competence and thereby be capable in the future to innovated BM's and operate BM's in new types Business Model Ecosystems (BMES) (Lindgren and Rasmussen in J Multi BMI 4: 1, 2016) in the future-where physical, digital and virtual BMES become integrated. This will investable open up to new multi business model potential but also require that businesses operate and innovate their multitudes of BM's differently. BMES and BM's (Lindgren in J Multi Bus Model Innov Technol 4: 1, 2016; Lindgren and Rasmussen in J Multi Bus Model Innov Technol 1: 135, 2013) have for a longtime been based and built up with mainly human bond communication, but new technologies very much based on machine to human communication and machine to machine communication evolves and change the game of BMI with exponential speed. How will this change the game of Business Model Innovation (BMI) between humans, humans and machines and machines to machines. How will this evolvement influence businesses ability to "download", "see", "sense", "relate" and "receive" and relate BM's with their AS IS and TO BE BM's. The paper addresses the exponential development of artificial intelligence technologies, persuasive technologies, virtual technologies and thereby increase the potential to create, capture, deliver, receive and consume physical, digital, persuasive virtual BMs in Business model innovation and introduce a conceptual model to future business model innovation and operation.

TI  - Food mukbang on social media: towards an AI-driven persuasive interventions for living healthy on social media
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
AB  - Social media has witnessed different eating practices, including food mukbang. Food mukbang is a type of video presentation where hosts consume large quantities of food while interacting with viewers. This study is situated on the social eating theory, which explains how people connect their individual interests with society. Though this practice has been on social media platforms for a while now, little is known about its health impact on a wide range of audiences. Unhealthy eating practices are associated with obesity and other chronic diseases, which are the leading causes of death in the world today. Given that there are unhealthy eating practices in food mukbang videos on social media, we collected thirty (30) food mukbang creative common license YouTube videos, and we extracted 2297 comments from these videos to study the trends. In view of this, we found that there is a collection of more unhealthy foods eaten to entertain viewers, different unhealthy eating behaviors such as eating quickly, talking while eating, and putting too much food in the mouth. In addition, we found that the viewers' sentiments were positive, and they loved watching these videos. Hence, in its best practice, we propose an AI-driven persuasive intervention because AI technologies are capable of detecting unhealthy eating patterns and persuasive interventions can promote a change in behavior (healthy eating behavior). Based on our findings, we present three design recommendations for YouTube and other social media designers to consider in future: (1) using artificial intelligence-related technologies for predicting videos, (2) using natural language processing to prompt feedback, and (3) auto-generating disclaimers at the beginning and end of the video.

TI  - The Feasibility of AgileNudge+Software to Facilitate Positive Behavioral Change: Mixed Methods Design
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: In today's digital age, web-based apps have become integral to daily life, driving transformative shifts in human behavior. "AgileNudge+' (Indiana University Center for Health Innovation and Implementation Science) is a web-based solution to simplify the process of positive behavior change using nudging as an intervention. By integrating knowledge from behavioral economics with technology, AgileNudge+ organizes multiple steps, simplifies complex tasks, minimizes errors by enhancing user engagement, and provides resources for creating and testing nudge interventions. Objective: This paper aimed to outlinethe design process, methodologies, and usefulness of "AgileNudge+' for the development of evidence-based nudges. It used a mixed methods approach to evaluate the software's interface usability and usefulness for creating and testing nudge interventions. Methods: AgileNudge+ was developed through iterative processes integrating principles from behavioral economics and user-centered design. The content of AgileNudge+operationalizes an Agile science-based process to efficiently design, embed, and disseminate evidence-based nudges that encourage positive behavior change without limiting choice. Using a mixed methods approach, we tested AgileNudge+software's ability to organize and simplify the nudge intervention process, allowing a diverse range of scholars with limited knowledge of Agile science to use nudges. Usability testing assessed the tool's usefulness and interface with a sample of 18 health care professionals, each asked to interact with the software and create a nudge intervention to solve a problem within their professional project's sphere. Results: The study was funded in August 2022, with data collection occurring fromJune 2023 to July 2024. As of July 2024, we have enrolled 18 participants. Quantitative results found a mean usefulness rating of AgileNudge+of 3.83 (95% CI 3.00-4.66). Qualitative results highlighted ways to modify the language used in AgileNudge+to be more comprehensible to a diverse user base and promoted modifications to the software that facilitate real-time assistance and prioritize time efficiency in user interactions. Feedback further supported the positive impact of gamification on participant motivation when using the software. Conclusions:AgileNudge+ is an effective assistive tool for simplifying the positive behavior change process using nudge interventions, with tailored content and interactions to meet users' needs and demands. Building onto the current design, future iterations of AgileNudge+ will use artificial intelligence to process large volumesof data while reducing the time and mental energy required to scan for existing cognitive biases and nudge prototypes. The software is also being upgraded to build on current gamification efforts, encouraging more sustained motivation by increasing the temporal resolution of the digital interface. These modifications stay true to the agility and user-centered aspects of AgileNudge+, emphasizing the novelty of the constantly evolving software design process.

TI  - Unpacking the impact of AI vs. human-generated review summary on hotel booking intentions
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study investigates the impacts of the source of hotel review summary (AI-generated vs. human-generated) on customers' trust, information processing, and booking intentions through three scenario-based experiments involving 764 participants. Study 1 reveals that human-generated (vs. AI-generated) summaries lead to a higher level of trust, which boosts booking intentions. Study 2 finds that with negative reviews, there's no significant difference in booking intentions between AI and human-generated summaries, suggesting trust isn't the sole mediator. Study 3 proposes that information processing effort is a potential mediator. The findings confirm that when review valence is negative, customers invest more cognitive effort when reading AI-generated compared to human-generated summaries. The results challenge the assumption that human-generated reviews are inherently more persuasive. This research addresses critical gaps in understanding AI-generated content's impact on customer behavior in the hospitality industry, offering both theoretical contributions and practical insights for integrating AI technologies in customer communication strategies.

TI  - Modelling argumentation in short text: A case of social media debate
T2  - SIMULATION MODELLING PRACTICE AND THEORY
AB  - The technological leaps of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of machine learning have triggered significant progress in a plethora of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding tasks. One of these tasks is argumentation mining which has received significant interest in recent years and is regarded as a key domain for future decision-making systems, behaviour modelling, and natural language understanding problems. Until recently, natural language modelling tasks, such as computational argumentation schemes, were often tested in controlled environments, such as persuasive essays, reducing unexpected behaviours that could occur in real-life settings, like a public debate on social media. Additionally, the growing demand for enhancing the trust and the explainability of the AI services has dictated the design and adoption of modelling schemes to increase the confidence in the outcomes of the AI solutions. This paper attempts to explore modelling argumentation in short text and proposes a novel framework for argumentation detection under the name Abstract Framework for Argumentation Detection (AFAD). Moreover, different proof-of-concept implementations are provided to examine the applicability of the proposed framework to very short text developing a rule-based mechanism and compare the results with data-driven solutions. Eventually, a combination of the deployed methods is applied increasing the correct predictions in the minority class on an imbalanced dataset. The findings suggest that the modelling process provides solid grounds for technical research while the hybrid solutions have the potential to be applied to a wide range of NLP-related tasks offering a deeper understanding of human language and reasoning.

TI  - COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR COMPUTER-PROGRAMS, DATABASES, AND COMPUTER-GENERATED WORKS - IS ANYTHING NEW SINCE CONTU
T2  - HARVARD LAW REVIEW
AB  - In 1976, Congress created the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to examine the implications of computer and other information technologies and to advise Congress on whether it would be wise to assimilate these new technologies into the existing copyright regime. Ever since, a number of people have voiced criticisms of CONTU's recommendations, arguing for a modification of the current copyright regime or even a different legal structure for these issues. Although these critics have many different approaches, they share the fear that incorporating these technologies into the current copyright system will lead to overprotection. In this Article, Professor Miller examines these arguments and concludes that CONTU's recommendations were correct and that the current regime is flexible enough to address the critics' concerns. First, Professor Miller surveys the progress of the court decisions involving computer programs, and demonstrates that a set of coherent copyright principles is beginning to develop in this area. Next, Professor Miller discusses the newer phenomenon of artificial intelligence, and utilizes copyright principles that have developed in the areas of computer programs and databases to demonstrate that at its current stage of development, artificial intelligence does not pose any significant obstacles to copyright analysis. Finally, Professor Miller addresses the claim that it eventually will be impossible to assimilate computer-generated works into the copyright system because they may have no obvious human author, and concludes not only that the caselaw contains no persuasive objection to extending copyright protection to these works, but also that such an extension would fulfill the constitutional imperative of promoting Progress in these areas.

T2  - 2024 2ND WORLD CONFERENCE ON COMMUNICATION & COMPUTING, WCONF 2024
CP  - 2nd IEEE World Conference on Communication and Computing (WCONF)
AB  - As is common knowledge, there is a long history of harassment of women all throughout the world, beginning with stalking and continuing to more serious types of abuse such as acid attacks, rape, obscenity, pornography, and other forms of abuse. In light of these worries, it has been proposed that the application of machine learning on tweets be utilized in order to do an analysis of the safety of women in urban areas of India. The Sentimental Analysis is employed as the primary idea, and it is carried out by machine learning using input from tweets. This is done to ensure that safety is taken into consideration. Increasing people's awareness can be accomplished by the use of sentiment analysis to tweets. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, which are well-known for their capacity to distribute information on a worldwide scale, provide women with the opportunity to communicate their feelings to the rest of the world. Because Twitter enables users to effortlessly connect with one another through text, audio, and video, we have listed it as a resource that is of great value. This enables our study to be more persuasive than the opinions of those who are in our immediate vicinity. In this study, a novel model that is referred to as the Artificial Intelligence based Safety Prediction Strategy (AISPS) is presented in order to provide a clear evaluation of the effectiveness of the system that has been recommended. The standard method known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized in order to do cross-validation on it.

TI  - Estimating the deep replicability of scientific findings using human and artificial intelligence
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
AB  - Replicability tests of scientific papers show that the majority of papers fail replication. Moreover, failed papers circulate through the literature as quickly as replicating papers. This dynamic weakens the literature, raises research costs, and demonstrates the need for new approaches for estimating a study's replicability. Here, we trained an artificial intelligence model to estimate a paper's replicability using ground truth data on studies that had passed or failed manual replication tests, and then tested the model's generalizability on an extensive set of out-of-sample studies. The model predicts replicability better than the base rate of reviewers and comparably as well as prediction markets, the best present-day method for predicting replicability. In out-of-sample tests on manually replicated papers from diverse disciplines and methods, the model had strong accuracy levels of 0.65 to 0.78. Exploring the reasons behind the model's predictions, we found no evidence for bias based on topics, journals, disciplines, base rates of failure, persuasion words, or novelty words like "remarkable" or "unexpected." We did find that the model's accuracy is higher when trained on a paper's text rather than its reported statistics and that n-grams, higher order word combinations that humans have difficulty processing, correlate with replication. We discuss how combining human and machine intelligence can raise confidence in research, provide research self-assessment techniques, and create methods that are scalable and efficient enough to review the ever-growing numbers of publications-a task that entails extensive human resources to accomplish with prediction markets and manual replication alone.

TI  - Usability and Acceptability of a Mobile App for Behavior Change and to Improve Immunization Coverage among Children in Pakistan: A Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB  - Background: Pakistan's immunization uptake rates are still significantly lower than anticipated despite several initiatives. Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience. Objective: The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers' attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan. Methods: A mixed-method design was employed for this study. The study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Hospital. Parents visiting the Community Health Center for 6-week vaccination of their children were recruited. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews that grasped the parent's attitudes and challenges to immunization, as well as their acceptability and accessibility of the smartphone-based behavior-change application to increase vaccine uptake. Stage 1 was followed by stage 2, in which data were collected through a questionnaire designed by using data from qualitative interviews. Results: The majority of participants agreed that immunization serves an important role in protecting their child from illnesses that cause morbidity and mortality. Almost all of them emphasized the importance of using a pre-appointment method at vaccination center in order to reduce the waiting time. Furthermore, participants were also interested in AI-based behavior modification applications related to immunization. They also wanted to have applications in their native language for better understanding and communication of related information. In our study, approximately 95.2 percent of participants agreed to accept SMS immunization updates, which was also reasonably high. Lastly, the majority of them identified forgetfulness as a significant contributor to regular immunization. Conclusion: To enhance the uptake of childhood vaccines, overall vaccination rates, and overcome barriers related to vaccination coverage, cost-effective and user-friendly mHealth AI-based smart phone applications are required to raise awareness regarding the continuation of vaccination service and the importance of timely vaccination. Parents' experiences and attitudes must be considered while designing and evaluating the efficacy of mHealth-based interventions.

T2  - SYMBOLIC AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO REASONING WITH UNCERTAINTY, ECSQARU 2021
CP  - 16th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU)
AB  - Explanation in Artificial Intelligence is often focused on providing reasons for why a model under consideration and its outcome are correct. Recently, research in explainable machine learning has initiated a shift in focus on including so-called counterfactual explanations. In this paper we propose to combine both types of explanation in the context of explaining Bayesian networks. To this end we introduce persuasive contrastive explanations that aim to provide an answer to the question Why outcome t instead of t'? posed by a user. In addition, we propose an algorithm for computing persuasive contrastive explanations. Both our definition of persuasive contrastive explanation and the proposed algorithm can be employed beyond the current scope of Bayesian networks.

TI  - Digital Mental Health Apps: Key Features and User Engagement for Better Wellness
T2  - INTELLIGENT DATA ENGINEERING AND AUTOMATED LEARNING - IDEAL 2024, PT I
CP  - 25th International Conference on Intelligent Data Engineering and Automated Learning
AB  - Given the global impact of mental disorders and the increasing prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as one of the main causes of disability, it is imperative to invest in solutions for self-management of mental health. Thus, the evolution of Digital Mental Health reveals a significant impact, with major investment in technologies that drive the development of projects that aim to innovate the benefits and results of this area. As part of the development of the RM4Health project, this work evaluated the role of web, desktop and/or mobile applications in the self-management of mental health, highlighting existing strengths and gaps. The study covered 205 applications for the management of mental health, detailing the panorama of current Behavioral Management practices, Persuasive Systems Design (PSD), Behavioral Economics (BE) principles and Security and Privacy strategies. The results obtained in this survey allow the definition of recommendations for the development of more effective, engaging, accessible and safe solutions, to promote autonomy in the management of the mental health condition. A high diversity of resources was observed, however areas of underutilization were identified, especially in BE approaches. It is recommended to combine Artificial Intelligence, Smart Coach and Gamification strategies with robust security and privacy measures. Furthermore, the development of comprehensive and intuitive solutions that prioritize key behavioral management functionalities, PSD resources and BE principles that involve the user in their own health management, regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with a mental disorder, were suggested. This study could guide future research and development in order to improve the quality of the user experience and drive advances in the field of Digital Mental Health.

TI  - Individualized self-care training systems for type 2 diabetes patients: a systematic review on characteristics of randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
T2  - UNIVERSAL ACCESS IN THE INFORMATION SOCIETY
AB  - Self-care is crucial for managing chronic diseases like Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Successful self-care is complex and influenced by many factors. Regarding the effectiveness of digital health (DH) systems on T2D self-care behaviors, this research aims to systematically review the characteristics of such systems employed in randomized controlled trial (RCT) studies. Searches of PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, and Science Direct were conducted from January 2011 to February 2022. The RCTs incorporated in this study provide personalized, tailored self-care training tips for individuals diagnosed with T2D. The National Institute of Health/National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute tool for controlled intervention studies was used for risk of bias assessment. A total of 26 studies were eligible. M-Health solutions were the most exciting technology for developing T2D self-care DH systems (22/26 studies). Blood glucose monitoring (88.46%), physical activities (76.92%), healthy diet (69.23%), and medication adherence (57.69%) were DH interventions' top self-care priorities. DH systems were mainly used for self-care data collecting (100%), recommendations (96.15%), and monitoring data analysis (84.62%). Educational (100%) and motivational (50%) themes were used for self-care interventions in most trials. We found that DH systems improve the most critical T2D self-care features (BG monitoring, physical exercise, healthy food, and medication adherence). However, more T2D pharmacoadherence trials are needed. This review is relevant for clinicians, self-care training system designers, and researchers interested in using DH solutions to empower T2D patients to manage their self-care.

TI  - Mobile Health Devices as Tools for Worldwide Cardiovascular Risk Reduction and Disease Management
T2  - CIRCULATION
AB  - We examined evidence on whether mobile health (mHealth) tools, including interactive voice response calls, short message service, or text messaging, and smartphones, can improve lifestyle behaviors and management related to cardiovascular diseases throughout the world. We conducted a state-of-the-art review and literature synthesis of peer-reviewed and gray literature published since 2004. The review prioritized randomized trials and studies focused on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, but included other reports when they represented the best available evidence. The search emphasized reports on the potential benefits of mHealth interventions implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Interactive voice response and short message service interventions can improve cardiovascular preventive care in developed countries by addressing risk factors including weight, smoking, and physical activity. Interactive voice response and short message service-based interventions for cardiovascular disease management also have shown benefits with respect to hypertension management, hospital readmissions, and diabetic glycemic control. Multimodal interventions including Web-based communication with clinicians and mHealth-enabled clinical monitoring with feedback also have shown benefits. The evidence regarding the potential benefits of interventions using smartphones and social media is still developing. Studies of mHealth interventions have been conducted in >30 low- and middle-income countries, and evidence to date suggests that programs are feasible and may improve medication adherence and disease outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that mHealth interventions may improve cardiovascular-related lifestyle behaviors and disease management. Next-generation mHealth programs developed worldwide should be based on evidence-based behavioral theories and incorporate advances in artificial intelligence for adapting systems automatically to patients' unique and changing needs.

TI  - An online advertising intervention to increase adherence to stay-at-home-orders during the COVID-19 pandemic: An efficacy trial monitoring individual-level mobility data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led public health departments to issue several orders and recommendations to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. However, for various reasons, including lack of ability to sufficiently monitor and influence behavior change, adherence to these health orders and recommendations has been suboptimal. Starting April 29, 2020, during the initial stay-at-home orders issued by various state governors, we conducted an intervention that sent online website and mobile application advertisements to people's mobile phones to encourage them to adhere to stay-at-home orders. Adherence to stay-at-home orders was monitored using individual-level cell phone mobility data, from April 29, 2020 through May 10, 2020. Mobile devices across 5 regions in the United States were randomly-assigned to either receive advertisements from our research team advising them to stay at home to stay safe (intervention group) or standard advertisements from other advertisers (control group). Compared to control group devices that received only standard corporate advertisements (i.e., did not receive public health advertisements to stay at home), the (intervention group) devices that received public health advertisements to stay at home demonstrated objectively-measured increased adherence to stay at home (i.e., smaller radius of gyration, average travel distance, and larger stay-at-home ratios). Results suggest that 1) it is feasible to use mobility data to assess efficacy of an online advertising intervention, and 2) online advertisements are a potentially effective method for increasing adherence to government/public health stay-at-home orders.

TI  - The media literacy dilemma: can ChatGPT facilitate the discernment of online health misinformation?
T2  - FRONTIERS IN COMMUNICATION
AB  - Online health misinformation carries serious social and public health implications. A growing prevalence of sophisticated online health misinformation employs advanced persuasive tactics, making misinformation discernment progressively more challenging. Enhancing media literacy is a key approach to improving the ability to discern misinformation. The objective of the current study was to examine the feasibility of using generative AI to dissect persuasive tactics as a media literacy scaffolding tool to facilitate online health misinformation discernment. In a mixed 3 (media literacy tool: control vs. National Library of Medicine [NLM] checklist vs. ChatGPT tool) x 2 (information type: true information vs. misinformation) x 2 (information evaluation difficulty: hard vs. easy) online experiment, we found that using dissecting persuasive strategies of ChatGPT can be equally effective when compared with the NLM checklist, and that information type was a significant moderator such that the ChatGPT tool was more effective in helping people identify true information than misinformation. However, the ChatGPT tool performed worse than control in terms of helping people discern misinformation. No difference was found in terms of perceived usefulness and future use intention of the ChatGPT tool and the NLM checklist. The results suggest that more interactive or conversational features might enhance usefulness of ChatGPT as a media literacy tool.

AB  - We compare the behavior of avatars in videogames with the expected behavior of humans in smart environments, particularly smart urban environments. As a result of this comparison we conclude that many aspects of controlling an avatar in a game environment will also be seen in controlling human behavior in smart urban environments. We predict a convergence of videogame environments with smart urban environments where the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the game environment can be compared with the AI of the smart urban environment that is responsible for the functioning of the smart city. Game characteristics such as immediate rewards for good behavior can also be foreseen.

TI  - Feature Selection for Physical Activity Prediction Using Ecological Momentary Assessments to Personalize Intervention Timing: Longitudinal Observational Study
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: There has been a surge in the development of apps that aim to improve health, physical activity (PA), and well-being through behavior change. These apps often focus on creating a long-term and sustainable impact on the user. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that are based on passive sensing of the user's current context (eg, via smartphones and wearables) have been devised to enhance the effectiveness of these apps and foster PA. JITAIs aim to provide personalized support and interventions such as encouraging messages in a context-aware manner. However, the limited range of passive sensing capabilities often make it challenging to determine the timing and context for delivering well-accepted and effective interventions. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can provide personal context by directly capturing user assessments (eg, moods and emotions). Thus, EMA might be a useful complement to passive sensing in determining when JITAIs are triggered. However, extensive EMA schedules need to be scrutinized, as they can increase user burden. Objective: The aim of the study was to use machine learning to balance the feature set size of EMA questions with the prediction accuracy regarding of enacting PA. Methods: A total of 43 healthy participants (aged 19-67 years) completed 4 EMA surveys daily over 3 weeks. These surveys prospectively assessed various states, including both motivational and volitional variables related to PA preparation (eg, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and perceived barriers) alongside stress and mood or emotions. PA enactment was assessed retrospectively via EMA and served as the outcome variable. Results: The best-performing machine learning models predicted PA engagement with a mean area under the curve score of 0.87 (SD 0.02) in 5-fold cross-validation and 0.87 on the test set. Particularly strong predictors included self-efficacy, stress, planning, and perceived barriers, indicating that a small set of EMA predictors can yield accurate PA prediction for these participants. Conclusions: A small set of EMA-based features like self-efficacy, stress, planning, and perceived barriers can be enough to predict PA reasonably well and can thus be used to meaningfully tailor JITAIs such as sending well-timed and context-aware support messages.

TI  - SlimMe, a Chatbot With Artificial Empathy for Personal Weight Management: System Design and Finding
T2  - FRONTIERS IN NUTRITION
AB  - As the obesity rate continues to increase persistently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective weight loss management strategy. Nowadays, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technologies coupled with the rapid spread of messaging platforms and mobile technology with easier access to internet technology offers professional dietitians an opportunity to provide extensive monitoring support to their clients through a chatbot with artificial empathy. This study aimed to design a chatbot with artificial empathic motivational support for weight loss called "SlimMe" and investigate how people react to a diet bot. The SlimMe infrastructure was built using Dialogflow as the natural language processing (NLP) platform and LINE mobile messenger as the messaging platform. We proposed a text-based emotion analysis to simulate artificial empathy responses to recognize the user's emotion. A preliminary evaluation was performed to investigate the early-stage user experience after a 7-day simulation trial. The result revealed that having an artificially empathic diet bot for weight loss management is a fun and exciting experience. The use of emoticons, stickers, and GIF images makes the chatbot response more interactive. Moreover, the motivational support and persuasive messaging features enable the bot to express more empathic and engaging responses to the user. In total, there were 1,007 bot responses from 892 user input messages. Of these, 67.38% (601/1,007) of the chatbot-generated responses were accurate to a relevant user request, 21.19% (189/1,007) inaccurate responses to a relevant request, and 10.31% (92/1,007) accurate responses to an irrelevant request. Only 1.12% (10/1,007) of the chatbot does not answer. We present the design of an artificially empathic diet bot as a friendly assistant to help users estimate their calorie intake and calories burned in a more interactive and engaging way. To our knowledge, this is the first chatbot designed with artificial empathy features, and it looks very promising in promoting long-term weight management. More user interactions and further data training and validation enhancement will improve the bot's in-built knowledge base and emotional intelligence base.

TI  - Chatbot ads with a human touch: A test of anthropomorphism, interactivity, and narrativity
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are increasingly capable of simulating human-like conversations. But, is this desirable for strategic communications? Will chatbots be more persuasive if they are more humanlike, not only in their appearance but also in their interaction and delivery of advertising content? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by mitigating violated expectancy. Narrative ads promote chatbot advertising through perceived transportation. A three-way interaction revealed that when a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence. Theoretical and practical implications for chatbot advertising are discussed.

TI  - Mood Themes the World
T2  - AM JOURNAL OF ART AND MEDIA STUDIES
AB  - Apparatus theory (a hybrid of McLuhan and Derrida) hypothesizes that a civiliza-tion of electracy (the digital apparatus) must learn how to thrive in a lifeworld in which the visceral faculty of appetite is hegemonic. The dominant axis of behavior today is fantasy -anxi-ety (attraction/repulsion). We propose that world theming has created a vernacular discourse that may be raised to a second power of expression as vehicle of visceral intelligence. The immediate claim is that theming in digital media augments mood (ambiance) into a power of imagination, just as dialectic in writing augmented logic into a power of reason. Fantasy today is persuasive, just as logical entailment is (was) in the rational order of literacy. Decisions de-termining real events today are being made in worlds of mood.World theming is evident in the vernacular art practices arising from recent advanc-es in artificial intelligence. The availability of commodity GPUs, along with public access to advanced research via GitHub, Kaggle, Hugging Face, and the proliferation of forums such as Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and others, has resulted in a renaissance of public engagement with technology-informed creative practice. In addition, the general availability of Google's previously internal-only development tool, Colab, in late 2017 provided access to cloud-based GPUs and storage systems accessible only to data scientists and academics. In early 2021 Ryan Murdock released a Colab notebook called Big Sleep that combined Ope-nAI's recently published Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with BigGAN. This model is a paradigmatic example of our observation. By early 2022, multiple derivations of this process incorporated alternative image generation techniques. This paper will demonstrate how the fundamental basis of these methods are distinctly electrate in their use of 'theme' and emphasis on 'mood' in world-building, including a case-study animation called Dissipative Off-ramps.

TI  - A Novel Key Influencing Factors Selection Approach of P2P Lending Investment Risk
T2  - MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB  - Recent frequent "thunderstorm incidents" of P2P lending industry have caused the panic of industry investors. To predict the investment risk of P2P lending, we should scientifically and rationally analyze the key influencing factors of P2P lending investment risk. Existing key influencing factors selection methods mainly involve traditional statistical approaches and artificial intelligence methods. The traditional statistical approaches cannot deal with the high-dimensional nonlinear problems, and it cannot find the exact key influencing factors of the P2P lending investment risk. The artificial intelligence methods cannot recognize and learn the application background, and the selected attributes without active thinking and personal perception may not be the key influencing factors of P2P lending investment risk. To address the above issues, a novel key influencing factors selection approach of P2P lending investment risk is proposed by combining the proposed fireworks coevolution binary glowworm swarm optimization (FCBGSO), multifractal dimension (MFD), probit regression, and artificial prior knowledge. First, multifractal dimension combined with the proposed FCBGSO is used to select the preliminary influencing factors of the investment risk; second, the nonsignificant relevant attributes in the preliminary influencing factors are removed using the probit regression, and we add the influencing factors extracted from the original dataset of P2P lending using the artificial prior knowledge into the retaining influencing factors after removing one by one. A small and reasonable number of influencing factor subsets are achieved. Finally, we evaluate each influencing factors subset using extreme learning machine (ELM), and the subset with the best classification accuracy is efficiently achieved, i.e., it is the key influencing factors of P2P lending investment risk. Experimental results on the real P2P lending dataset from the Renrendai platform demonstrate that the proposed approach performs better than other state-of-the-art methods and that it has validity and effectiveness. It provides a new research idea for the key influencing factors selection of P2P lending investment risk.

TI  - GLOBAL TRENDS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SEPSIS-RELATED RESEARCH: A BIBLIOMETRIC ANALYSIS
T2  - SHOCK
AB  - Background: In the field of bibliometrics, although some studies have conducted literature reviews and analyses on sepsis, these studies mainly focus on specific areas or technologies, such as the relationship between the gut microbiome and sepsis, or immunomodulatory treatments for sepsis. However, there are still few studies that provide comprehensive bibliometric analyses of global scientific publications related to AI in sepsis research. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the global trend analysis of AI applications in sepsis based on publication output, citations, co-authorship between countries, and co-occurrence of author keywords. Methods: A total of 4,382 papers published from 2015 to December 2024 were retrieved and downloaded from the Science Citation Index Expanded database in Web of Science. After selecting the document types as articles and reviews, and conducting eligibility checks on titles and abstracts, the final bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace included 4,209 papers. Results: The number of published papers increased sharply starting in 2021, accounting for 58.14% (2,447/4,209) of all included papers. The United States and China together account for approximately 60.16% (2,532/4,209) of the total publications. Among the top 10 institutions in AI research on sepsis, seven are located in the United States. Rishikesan Kamaleswaran is the most contributing author, with PLOS ONE having more citations in this field than other journals. SCIENTIFIC REPORTS is also the most influential journal (NP = 106, H-index = 23, IF: 3.8). Conclusion: This study highlights the popular areas of AI research, provides a comprehensive overview of the research trends of AI in sepsis, and offers potential collaboration and future research prospects. To make AI-based clinical research sufficiently persuasive in sepsis practice, collaborative research is needed to improve the maturity and robustness of AI-driven models.

T2  - RHETORICA-A JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF RHETORIC
AB  - This paper shows how Whately's view of presumption as a preoccupation of the ground plays an indispensable role in the study of persuasive aspects of appeals to authority and deference. This is done by showing how important connections among arguments from authority, presumption, burden of proof, and deference can be precisely defined, combined, and fitted into a formal argumentation framework for responding to arguments from expert opinion and analyzing the ad verecundiam fallacy. As the inquiry into Whately's ideas also reveals links between Aristotelian topics and dialectic later brought out by Perelman, it constitutes an illustration showing how the study of various historically important rhetorical ideas allows us to develop contemporary models of arguments.

TI  - A dialogue system specification for explanation
T2  - SYNTHESE
AB  - This paper builds a dialectical system of explanation with speech act rules that define the kinds of moves allowed, like requesting and offering an explanation. Pre and post-condition rules for the speech acts determine when a particular speech act can be put forward as a move in the dialogue, and what type of move or moves must follow it. A successful explanation has been achieved when there has been a transfer of understanding from the party giving the explanation to the party asking for it. The dialogue has an opening stage, an explanation stage and a closing stage. Whether a transfer of understanding has taken place is tested by a dialectical shift to an examination dialogue.

TI  - Formal systems for persuasion dialogue
T2  - KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING REVIEW
AB  - This article reviews formal systems that regulate persuasion dialogues. In such dialogues two or more participants aim to resolve a difference of opinion, each trying to persuade the other participants to adopt their point of view. Systems for persuasion dialogue have found application in various fields of computer science, such as non-monotonic logic, artificial intelligence and law, multi-agent systems, intelligent tutoring and computer-supported collaborative argumentation. Taking a game-theoretic view on dialogue systems, this review proposes a formal specification of the main elements of dialogue systems for persuasion and then uses it to critically review some of the main formal systems for persuasion. The focus of this review will be on regulating the interaction between agents rather than on the design and behaviour of individual agents within a dialogue.

TI  - An Analysis of the Interaction Between Intelligent Software Agents and Human Users
T2  - MINDS AND MACHINES
AB  - Interactions between an intelligent software agent (ISA) and a human user are ubiquitous in everyday situations such as access to information, entertainment, and purchases. In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user's access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user's behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA's utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour. We discuss some of the ethical, social and legal implications of this technology and argue that it can sometimes exploit and reinforce weaknesses in human beings.

TI  - SOFT LAW, HARD JUSTICE: REGULATING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN ARBITRATION
T2  - CONTEMPORARY ASIA ARBITRATION JOURNAL
AB  - Artificial Intelligence (hereinafter "A.I.") is predicated on the notion that a computer programme can mimic all aspects of intellect and learning if they were meticulously documented. A.I. is increasingly being used in international arbitration by various stakeholders, including experts, litigants, tribunals and arbitrators at different stages. However, while A.I. has become increasingly prevalent in arbitration, there is still a regulatory vacuum that needs be bridged. The increasing use of A.I. in arbitration to improve procedural efficiency and decision-making raises serious concerns about the lack of a strong regulatory framework. The use of unregulated A.I. raises multiple technological challenges, which have resulted in some courts mandating the disclosure of A.I. use. These concerns are exacerbated by A.I.s' limited capacity to comprehend cultural nuances. Additionally, legal and ethical considerations arise, such as the permissible extent of A.I. usage in the arbitral process by various players, the duty to verify A.I.-generated work, the question of liability brought upon due to risks of algorithmic bias, or the leak of confidential information. Research indicates a rise in calls for greater transparency in the use of A.I. in arbitration, and the need for regulation. While previous attempts to regulate A.I. certainly provide a starting point for the regulation of A.I. in the arbitral process, they are neither universally recognized, nor implemented across jurisdictions. In this backdrop, there is a need for an international legal instrument that either regulates, or encourages the regulation of A.I. in arbitration. The authors in this paper argue for the regulation of A.I. in arbitration using an internationally-recognised soft-law framework. The flexibility and adaptability provided by soft law frameworks would complement the "international" and voluntary nature of arbitration. The proposed soft law framework could materialize in three ways: first, regulators could develop an international legal instrument based on which States can develop their own laws (much like the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law); second, A.I.-related arbitrations could follow the soft law guidelines as best practices, with the guidelines having persuasive value similar to the International Bar Association (IBA) Rules; or third, soft law could encourage arbitration institutions to incorporate relevant clauses on A.I. use in their procedural rules. The authors also explore the considerations which such a soft law ought to address. The need for such a framework is not to draw boundaries, or control the innovative path of A.I., rather, it is to put in place ethical barriers and dynamic safeguards for identifiable risks, and to work in tandem with the requisite human oversight throughout the life cycles of A.I. processes. This would be a balanced approach which addresses issues of law, ethics, and technology on one hand, while encouraging creativity and flexibility in the field of arbitration on the other.

TI  - Sponsorship Disclosure in Virtual Influencer Marketing: Assessing Users' Sentiment and Engagement Toward Virtual Influencer Endorsements
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING RESEARCH
AB  - This study evaluates how sponsorship disclosure affects users' parasocial interaction with virtual influencers (VIs). Sentiment analysis of 48,147 comments (sponsored = 20,411, non-sponsored = 27,736) indicated that users expressed more positive sentiment toward the VI's sponsorship disclosure. Topic modeling revealed that, regardless of sponsorship disclosure, users were confused about the VI's identity and expressed mixed emotions. Users also behaved differently toward the VI's sponsorship disclosure. An online experiment (N = 159) found that users who encountered non-sponsored content displayed greater likelihood for parasocial interaction and post engagement. The mediating role of persuasion knowledge was non-significant, challenging the persuasion knowledge model.

TI  - Understanding users' AI manipulation intention: An empirical investigation of the antecedents in the context of AI recommendation algorithms
T2  - INFORMATION & MANAGEMENT
AB  - This study examines antecedents that drive platform users to manipulate artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation algorithms. Based on the persuasion knowledge model (PKM), survey data collected from YouTube and Instagram users reveal that AI manipulation intentions are positively affected by persuasion knowledge about AI and perceived interactivity. Perceived interactivity is associated with higher perceived benefits and lower perceived costs of AI manipulation, consequently affecting manipulation intentions. A multivariate analysis of variance shows variations in intentions to use different types of AI manipulation behaviors among users with varying levels of persuasion knowledge. The research contributes to the PKM and AI-human interaction literature.

The goal of the game is to take a ball from a robot, and afterwards try to hand it back while the robot moves. The robot records the behavior patterns of each individual player and gradually adapts the challenge of the game to the player's skill. The game was investigated in two independent field studies. The primary goal was to observe how the robot adapts to players with different mobility problems, secondly to obtain knowledge about the different play patterns and get ideas about future improvements of the game. The video shows different examples of how the elderly would play with the robot and illustrates the variety of play styles.

T2  - 2023 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SOFTWARE MAINTENANCE AND EVOLUTION, ICSME
CP  - 39th IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME)
AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have heroine integral to the coding workflow, facilitating productivity through auto -completion, code suggestions, and chat dialogues. More than ever, the psychological relationship between software engineers and Al partners requires further exploration, mirroring the need to understand the psychological aspects of pilot-navigator roles these tools partly simulate, as highlighted in earlier studies. [Goal] The presented research aims to investigate the programmer behavior change and psychological effects of Al -assisted programming on professionals and undergraduates. [Methods' The authors performed a series of seven experimental programming sessions on the undergraduate student sample, subjecting them to programming in solo, pair, and AI-assisted settings. Following the experimental sessions, five semi -structured interviews were conducted with the experimental participants from the academic realm and another five with experienced users of Al programming tools from the professional realm. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis in an essentialist way, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the participants' experiences, feelings, and attitudes toward Alassisted programming. [Results] A total of ten themes were identified, half shared across the two realms, with 51 constituent codes selected from the professional and 35 from the student interview transcripts. The realm-agnostic themes were: "Effectance", "Intrinsic Motivation", "Perceived Al Personality", "Dynamics of Human and Al Pairing," and "Paradigm Shifts". 'the realm -specific themes included: "Personal Growth and Development", "Prospects", "Ethical Considerations", "Safety", and "Effects on Learning Processes". [Conclusion' The presented research illuminates the profound potential of using Al as a programming partner in simulated pilot-navigator roles in both professional and academic realms. It underscores the importance of understanding its effects on psychological well-being and human experience. Incorporating the revealed psychological aspects of human -Al interaction, its benefits, limitations, and dynamics will be pivotal for successful Al implementation and continued evolution in software engineering contexts.

TI  - Wearable and Mobile Sensors for Personalized Nutrition
T2  - ACS SENSORS
AB  - While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently, guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals' responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including caloriescounting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly emerging wearable chemical sensing devices.generating enormous dynamic analytical data.with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition.

TI  - Legitimization of paltry favors effect and chatbot-moderated fundraising
T2  - CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - Labor shortages and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology have accelerated the application of AI chatbot agents in fundraising agencies. This study examines the applicability of the legitimization of the paltry favors (LPF) technique and chatbot image representation in raising the persuasive power of fundraising chatbots. In this study, 609 participants were recruited via a crowdsourcing website to participate in an online survey. Participants were assigned to one of six chatbot conditions (text only vs. robot image vs. human image x standard message vs. LPF message). The results revealed that the LPF message increases the willingness to donate and that self-image concern, requestor need, and guilt significantly mediate the direct effect. The results also suggest the moderating role of perceived anthropomorphism in the association between LPF messages and the willingness to donate via requester needs. The results provide theoretical implications for compliance-gaining studies and practical implications for fundraising organizations and chatbot developers.

TI  - Scaffolding the Mastery of Healthy Behaviors with Fittle plus Systems: Evidence-Based Interventions and Theory
T2  - HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - We present a series of mHealth applications and studies pursued as part of the Fittle+ project. This program of research has the dual aims of (1) bringing scalable evidence-based behavior-change interventions to mHealth and evaluating them and (2) developing theoretically based predictive models to better understand the dynamics of the impact of these interventions on achieving behavior-change goals. Our approach in the Fittle+ systems rests on the idea that to master the complex fabric of a new healthy lifestyle, one must weave together a new set of healthy habits that over-ride the old unhealthy habits. To achieve these aims, we have developed a series of mHealth platforms that provide scaffolding interventions: Behavior-change techniques and associated mHealth interactions (e.g., SMS reminders; chatbot dialogs; user interface functionality; etc.) that provide additional support to the acquisition and maintenance of healthy habits. We present experimental evidence collected so far for statistically significant improvements in behavior change in eating, exercise, and physical activity for the following scaffolding interventions: guided mastery, teaming, self-affirmation, and implementation intentions. We also present predictive computational ACT-R models of daily individual behavior goal success for data collected in guided mastery and implementation intention studies that address goal-striving and habit formation mechanisms.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS
CP  - 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW)
AB  - The boardgame Diplomacy is a challenging setting for communicative and cooperative artificial intelligence. The most prominent communicative Diplomacy AI, Cicero, has excellent strategic abilities, exceeding human players. However, the best Diplomacy players master communication, not just tactics, which is why the game has received attention as an AI challenge. This work seeks to understand the degree to which Cicero succeeds at communication. First, we annotate in-game communication with abstract meaning representation to separate in-game tactics from general language. Second, we run two dozen games with humans and Cicero, totaling over 200 humanplayer hours of competition. While AI can consistently outplay human players, AI-Human communication is still limited because of AI's difficulty with deception and persuasion. This shows that Cicero relies on strategy and has not yet reached the full promise of communicative and cooperative AI.

TI  - Virtual emotions and Criminal Law
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - This article examines the role that Criminal Law should play in regulating the non-therapeutic use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR), specifically its massive use by consumers. The starting point has been to consider VR as an intermediate risk scenario, for the purposes of Criminal Law, between the criminality entirely generated in the physical world and that developed in the 2D digital environments [cybercrimes and criminality linked to social networks and persuasive Artificial Intelligence (AI)]. Firstly, specialize literature has been analyzed to establish the nature of virtual reality. From a technical standpoint, virtual reality is a neurotechnology infused with high-risk artificial intelligence; an inseparable synthesis of non-invasive neurotechnology and a set of AI systems, considered high-risk for the fundamental rights of citizens. From the perspective of its functioning, VR is a "transformative" neurotechnology capable of altering what people perceive as reality. This is possible, because its realism lies in the emotional immersion of the user in the virtual experience, similarly to how our brain functions. Therefore, the key idea in the immersive functioning of virtual reality is its capacity to evoke and modify human emotions, which results its greater harmful potential compared to the 2D environment. From there, three central and specific areas of (legally unaddressed) risk arise: (1) the special comprehensive nature of the data collected and stored during its use; (2) its ability to mentally reproduce the "physical" experience of the avatar in the user; and (3) its significant capacity to manipulate individuals. Secondly, the paper examines both the reported cases and the foreseeable criminality in virtual worlds or "proto-metaverse," focusing on the three risk areas, and exemplifying them with attacks on mental privacy, sexual freedom, and consumer manipulation. Finally, it is proposed that Criminal Law should also intervene (as soon as possible) to define the "red lines" of massive virtual reality use by citizens. With a democratic and human-centered approach, a basic legal framework is outlined for the criminalization of specific harms and risks associated with virtual reality, adapting the existing legal framework as necessary.

TI  - Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Health Message Generation: The Folic Acid Message Engine
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Communication campaigns using social media can raise public awareness; however, they are difficult to sustain. A barrier is the need to generate and constantly post novel but on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck.
   Objective: In this study, we aim to harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a pilot system that can generate many candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign to suggest novel, on-topic candidate messages. The issue of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example; however, the system can work with other issues that could benefit from higher levels of public awareness.
   Methods: We used the Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine-tuned it using a data set of autodownloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine-tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is, to create new messages about this topic. We conducted a web-based study to gauge how human raters evaluate AI-generated tweet messages compared with original, human-crafted messages.
   Results: We found that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Web-based raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a human-curated sample of AI-generated messages as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results showed that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for web-based campaigns that focus on promoting awareness.
   Conclusions: The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for the quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage.

A growing segment of this work is examining how information and communication technologies (ICTs) can be used to achieve health equity, that is, fair opportunities for all people to live a healthy life. Such advances are sorely needed, as there exist large disparities in morbidity and mortality across population groups. These disparities are due in large part to social determinants of health, that is, social, physical, and economic conditions that disproportionately inhibit wellbeing in populations such as low-socioeconomic status and racial and ethnic minority groups.
   Despite years of digital health research and commercial innovation, profound health disparities persist. In this talk, I will argue that to reduce health disparities, ICTs must address social determinants of health. Intelligent interfaces have much to offer in this regard, and yet their affordances-such as the ability to deliver personalized health interventions-can also act as pitfalls. For example, a focus on personalized health interventions has lead to the design of various interfaces focused on individual-level behavior change. While such innovations are important, to achieve health equity there is also a need for complimentary systems that address social relationships. Social ties are a crucial point of focus for digital health research as they can provide meaningful supports for positive health, especially in populations that disproportionately experience health barriers. I will offer a vision for health equity research in which interactive and intelligent systems are designed to help people build social relationships that support wellbeing. By conceptualizing the purview of digital health research as encompassing not only individual but also social change, there is tremendous opportunity to create disruptive health interventions that help achieve health equity.

TI  - Data-centered persuasion: Nudging user's prosocial behavior and designing social innovation
T2  - COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR
AB  - By employing individuals' behavioral data collected from routinely used devices, a more effective 'nudging' toward changes in individuals' attitudes and behavior can be implemented. To examine the persuasive effect on inducing prosocial behaviors, two types of system concepts were designed, namely shared value systems. We manipulated the usage context of these systems and tested the effects with two independent variables: the status of the system agent and the valence of the agent's feedback. As a result, this study revealed that users' satisfaction and intention for prosocial behavior increased after they experienced the shared value system based on the concept of self-preferential value. Interaction effects were also found between the status of the system agent and the valence of the agent's feedback. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Say an AI program someday passes a Turing test, because it can converse in a way indistinguishable from a human. And say that its developers can then teach it to converse-and even present an extended persuasive argument-in a way indistinguishable from the sort of human we call a "lawyer." The program could thus become an AI brief-writer, capable of regularly winning brief-writing competitions against human lawyers.
   Once that happens (if it ever happens), this Essay argues, the same technology can be used to create AI judges, judges that we should accept as no less reliable (and more cost-effective) than human judges. If the software can create persuasive opinions, capable of regularly winning opinion-writing competitions against human judges-and if it can be adequately protected against hacking and similar attacks-we should in principle accept it as a judge, even if the opinions do not stem from human judgment.

TI  - Digital chameleons - Automatic assimilation of nonverbal gestures in immersive virtual environments
T2  - PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Previous research demonstrated social influence resulting from mimicry ( the chameleon effect); a confederate who mimicked participants was more highly regarded than a confederate who did not, despite the fact that participants did not explicitly notice the mimicry. In the current study, participants interacted with an embodied artificial intelligence agent in immersive virtual reality. The agent either mimicked a participant's head movements at a 4-s delay or utilized prerecorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Mimicking agents were more persuasive and received more positive trait ratings than nonmimickers, despite participants' inability to explicitly detect the mimicry. These data are uniquely powerful because they demonstrate the ability to use automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) to gain social influence. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate social influence effects with a nonhuman, nonverbal mimicker.

TI  - Co-Designing a Smoking Cessation Chatbot:Focus Group Studyof End Users and Smoking Cessation Professionals
T2  - JMIR HUMAN FACTORS
AB  - Background: Our prototype smoking cessation chatbot, Quin, provides evidence-based, personalized support delivered via asmartphone app to help people quit smoking. We developed Quin using a multiphase program of co-design research, part ofwhich included focus group evaluation of Quin among stakeholders prior to clinical testing. Objective: This study aimed to gather and compare feedback on the user experience of the Quin prototype from end users andsmoking cessation professionals (SCPs) via a beta testing process to inform ongoing chatbot iterations and refinements.Methods: Following active and passive recruitment, we conducted web-based focus groups with SCPs and end users fromQueensland, Australia. Participants tested the app for 1-2 weeks prior to focus group discussion and could also log conversationfeedback within the app. Focus groups of SCPs were completed first to review the breadth and accuracy of information, andfeedback was prioritized and implemented as major updates using Agile processes prior to end user focus groups. We categorizedlogged in-app feedback using content analysis and thematically analyzed focus group transcripts. Results: In total, 6 focus groups were completed between August 2022 and June 2023; 3 for SCPs (n=9 participants) and 3 forend users (n=7 participants). Four SCPs had previously smoked, and most end users currently smoked cigarettes (n=5), and 2had quit smoking. The mean duration of focus groups was 58 (SD 10.9; range 46-74) minutes. We identified four major themesfrom focus group feedback: (1) conversation design, (2) functionality, (3) relationality and anthropomorphism, and (4) role as asmoking cessation support tool. In response to SCPs'feedback, we made two major updates to Quin between cohorts: (1)improvements to conversation flow and (2) addition of the "Moments of Crisis" conversation tree. Participant feedback alsoinformed 17 recommendations for future smoking cessation chatbot developments. Conclusions: Feedback from end users and SCPs highlighted the importance of chatbot functionality, as this underpinned Quin'sconversation design and relationality. The ready accessibility of accurate cessation information and impartial support that Quinprovided was recognized as a key benefit for end users, the latter of which contributed to a feeling of accountability to the chatbot.Findings will inform the ongoing development of a mature prototype for clinical testing.

TI  - Cloud Neural Fuzzy PID Hybrid Integrated Algorithm of Flatness Control
T2  - JOURNAL OF IRON AND STEEL RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
AB  - In connection with the characteristics of multi-disturbance and nonlinearity of a system for flatness control in cold rolling process, a new intelligent PID control algorithm was proposed based on a cloud model, neural network and fuzzy integration. By indeterminacy artificial intelligence, the problem of fixing the membership functions of input variables and fuzzy rules was solved in an actual fuzzy system and the nonlinear mapping between variables was implemented by neural network. The algorithm has the adaptive learning ability of neural network and the indeterminacy of a cloud model in processing knowledge, which makes the fuzzy system have more persuasion in the process of knowledge inference, realizing the online adaptive regulation of PID parameters and avoiding the defects of the traditional PID controller. Simulation results show that the algorithm is simple, fast and robust with good control performance and application value.

TI  - A Behavioral Economics Approach to Digitalisation - The Case of a Principles-based Taxonomy
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 10TH INTERNATIONAL RAIS CONFERENCE ON SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (RAIS 2018)
CP  - 10th International RAIS Conference on Social Sciences and Humanities (RAIS)
AB  - A growing body of academic research in the field of behavioural economics, political science and psychology demonstrate how an invisible hand can nudge people's decisions towards a preferred option. Contrary to the assumptions of the neoclassical economics, supporters of nudging argue that people have problems coping with a complex world, because of their limited knowledge and their restricted rationality. Technological improvement in the age of information has increased the possibilities to control the innocent social media users or penalise private investors and reap the benefits of their existence in hidden persuasion and discrimination. Nudging enables nudgers to plunder the simple uneducated and uninformed citizen and investor, who is neither aware of the nudging strategies nor able to oversee the tactics used by the nudgers (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b). The nudgers are thereby legally protected by democratically assigned positions they hold. The law of motion of the nudging societies holds an unequal concentration of power of those who have access to compiled data and coding rules, relevant for political power and influencing the investor's decision usefulness (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b). This paper takes as a case the "transparency technology XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language)" (Sunstein 2013, 20), which should make data more accessible as well as usable for private investors. It is part of the choice architecture on regulation by governments (Sunstein 2013). However, XBRL is bounded to a taxonomy (Piechocki and Felden 2007). Considering theoretical literature and field research, a representation issue (Beerbaum, Piechocki and Weber 2017) for principles-based accounting taxonomies exists, which intelligent machines applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) (Mwilu, Prat and Comyn-Wattiau 2015) nudge to facilitate decision usefulness. This paper conceptualizes ethical questions arising from the taxonomy engineering based on machine learning systems: Should the objective of the coding rule be to support or to influence human decision making or rational artificiality? This paper therefore advocates for a democratisation of information, education and transparency about nudges and coding rules (Puaschunder 2017a, b; 2018a, b).

TI  - Brain versus bot: Distinguishing letters of recommendation authored by humans compared with artificial intelligence
T2  - AEM EDUCATION AND TRAINING
AB  - Objectives: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are essential within academic medicine, affecting a number of important decisions regarding advancement, yet these letters take significant amounts of time and labor to prepare. The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are gaining popularity for a variety of academic writing tasks and offer an innovative solution to relieve the burden of letter writing. It is yet to be determined if ChatGPT could aid in crafting LORs, particularly in high-stakes contexts like faculty promotion. To determine the feasibility of this process and whether there is a significant difference between AI and human-authored letters, we conducted a study aimed at determining whether academic physicians can distinguish between the two.Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a single-blind design. Academic physicians with experience in reviewing LORs were presented with LORs for promotion to associate professor, written by either humans or AI. Participants reviewed LORs and identified the authorship. Statistical analysis was performed to determine accuracy in distinguishing between human and AI-authored LORs. Additionally, the perceived quality and persuasiveness of the LORs were compared based on suspected and actual authorship.Results: A total of 32 participants completed letter review. The mean accuracy of distinguishing between human- versus AI-authored LORs was 59.4%. The reviewer's certainty and time spent deliberating did not significantly impact accuracy. LORs suspected to be human-authored were rated more favorably in terms of quality and persuasiveness. A difference in gender-biased language was observed in our letters: human-authored letters contained significantly more female-associated words, while the majority of AI-authored letters tended to use more male-associated words.Conclusions: Participants were unable to reliably differentiate between human- and AI-authored LORs for promotion. AI may be able to generate LORs and relieve the burden of letter writing for academicians. New strategies, policies, and guidelines are needed to balance the benefits of AI while preserving integrity and fairness in academic promotion decisions.

T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN HCI, AI-HCI 2023, PT I
CP  - 4th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in HCI (AI-HCI) Held as Part of the 25th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII)
AB  - When it comes to persuading other people, non-verbal cues play an important role in order to be successful. Mostly, people use these non-verbal cues subconsciously and, from the perspective of the persuadee, are not aware of the subliminal impact of them. To raise awareness of subliminal persuasion, we analyzed videos of different political public speeches. We used the labels of three annotators to train three subjective neural networks capable of predicting their degree of perceived persuasiveness based on the images as input only. We then created visualizations of the predictions for each network/annotator to draw conclusions about what the annotators have most likely focused on. For that, we employed layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) that highlights the most relevant image sections for each prediction. Our results show that techniques like LRP can help uncover existing subliminal bias.

TI  - The Persuasive Power of AI Ingratiation: A Persuasion Knowledge Theory Perspective
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - This article examines the emerging marketing tactic of artificial intelligence (AI) ingratiation of humans and reveals that AI ingratiation leads to increased consumer acceptance of product recommendations. The positive effect of ingratiation is explained by consumers' self-enhancing motivations to believe that AI's ingratiating comments are particularly accurate and objective. Moreover, these ingratiation effects are moderated by the extent to which AI is anthropomorphized. Counter to the literature showing benefits of anthropomorphism and consistent with the persuasion knowledge model, consumers perceive ingratiation by humanlike (vs. machinelike) AI systems to be more driven by ulterior motives, thereby activating consumer defense mechanisms against ingratiation attempts. Our theory and findings elucidate how AI design features serve to strengthen or weaken consumer resistance to persuasion. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development and ethical utilization of the sophisticated conversational AI that are fast emerging in various marketing contexts.

TI  - AI under the test of "beyond any reasonable doubt" in interpreting criminal law
T2  - REVISTA DE ESTUDOS CONSTITUCIONAIS HERMENEUTICA E TEORIA DO DIREITO-RECHTD
AB  - The paper illustrates the possibility of using AI not only as an instrument to check the facts in a criminal trial but even to interpret and resolve significantly legal matters. Currently, the "expert systems" developed for this purpose take advantage of the judicial precedents as the basis of knowledge: given that, it is argued that these algorithms in a Constitutional State can not work based on the statistical rule of "more likely than not", but they should be programmed according to the "political" alternative rule of 'beyond any reasonable doubt', which should be extended even to the doubt in interpreting the law. Thus, in the case of opposing judicial precedents, Al systems should suggest the most favorable interpretation for the defendant, and the judge should dissent only by explaining why he does not hold plausible the most favorable judicial precedent.

TI  - Using AI predicted personality to enhance advertising effectiveness
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is twofold: first to demonstrate the application of an algorithm using contextual data to ascertain consumer personality traits; and second to explore the factors impacting the relationship between personality traits and advertisement persuasiveness.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A mixed-method approach that comprises two distinct yet complementary studies. The first uses quantitative methods and is based on a sample of 35,264 retail banking customers. Study 2 explores the findings that emerge from Study 1 using qualitative methods.
   Findings
   This paper finds that matching consumer personality with congruent advertising messages can lead to more effective consumer persuasion for most personality types. For consumers who exhibit neurotic personality traits, ameliorating perceived risks during purchasing and providing cues for social acceptance and goal attainment are important factors for advertising effectiveness. These factors also had a positive impact on the purchasing behaviour of extroverted consumers.
   Research limitations/implications
   This research focusses on understanding purchasing behaviour based on the most dominant personality trait. However, people are likely to exhibit a combination of most or even all of the Big Five personality traits.
   Practical implications
   Building on advances in natural language processing, enabling the identification of personality from language, this study demonstrates the possibility of influencing consumer behaviour by matching machine inferred personality to congruent persuasive advertising. It is one of the few studies to use contextual instead of social media data to capture individual personality. Such data serves to capture an authentic rather than contrived persona. Further, the study identifies the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation of why some personality traits exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory.
   Originality/value
   Although the idea that people are more likely to be responsive to advertising messages that are congruent with their personality type has already been successfully applied by advertising practitioners and documented by advertising scholars, this study extends existing research by identifying the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation why some personality traits may exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory.

TI  - Expressive Interviewing Agents to Support Health-Related Behavior Change: Randomized Controlled Study of COVID-19 Behaviors
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Expressive writing and motivational interviewing are well-known approaches to help patients cope with stressful life events. Although these methods are often applied by human counselors, it is less well understood if an automated artificial intelligence approach can benefit patients. Providing an automated method would help expose a wider range of people to the possible benefits of motivational interviewing, with lower cost and more adaptability to sudden events like the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objective: This study presents an automated writing system and evaluates possible outcomes among participants with respect to behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We developed a rule-based dialogue system for "Expressive Interviewing" to elicit writing from participants on the subject of how COVID-19 has impacted their lives. The system prompts participants to describe their life experiences and emotions and provides topic-specific prompts in responseto participants' use of topical keywords. In May 2021 andJune2021, we recruited participants (N=151) via Prolific to complete either the Expressive Interviewing task or a control task. We surveyed participants immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and again 2 weeks after the intervention. We measured participants' self-reported stress, general mental health, COVID-19-related health behavior, and social behavior.
   Results: Participants generally wrote long responses during the task (53.3 words per response). In aggregate, task participants experienced a significant decrease in stress in the short term (similar to 23% decrease, P<.001) and a slight difference in social activity compared with the control group (P=.03). No significant differences in short-term or long-term outcomeswere detected between participant subgroups (eg, male versus female participants) except for some within-condition differences by ethnicity (eg, higher social activity among African American people participating in Expressive Interviewing vs participants of other ethnicities). For short-term effects, participants showed different outcomes based on their writing. Using more anxiety-related words was correlated with a greater short-term decrease in stress (r=-0.264, P<.001), and using more positive emotion words was correlated with a more meaningful experience (r=0.243, P=.001). As for long-term effects,writing with more lexical diversity was correlated with an increase in social activity (r=0.266, P<.001).
   Conclusions: Expressive Interviewing participants exhibited short-term, but not long-term, positive changes in mental health, and some linguistic metrics of writing style were correlated with positive change in behavior. Although there were no significant long-term effects observed, the positive short-term effects suggest that the Expressive Interviewing intervention could be used in cases in which a patient lacks access to traditional therapy and needs a short-term solution.

AB  - From a perspective of behavioral change, we review medical chatbot literature included in top peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and build up a comprehensive picture. We examine literature on how people feel about using a medical chatbot and based on that how far chatbots are useful to change harmful behavior. To structure the review we use the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action. Based on this we conclude five design-oriented recommendations. We expect this research to identify behavioral aspects that contribute to the acceptance, usage and effectiveness of medical chatbots in future.

TI  - The Internet as Cognitive Enhancement
T2  - SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS
AB  - The Internet has been identified in human enhancement scholarship as a powerful cognitive enhancement technology. It offers instant access to almost any type of information, along with the ability to share that information with others. The aim of this paper is to critically assess the enhancement potential of the Internet. We argue that unconditional access to information does not lead to cognitive enhancement. The Internet is not a simple, uniform technology, either in its composition, or in its use. We will look into why the Internet as an informational resource currently fails to enhance cognition. We analyze some of the phenomena that emerge from vast, continual fluxes of information-information overload, misinformation and persuasive design-and show how they could negatively impact users' cognition. Methods for mitigating these negative impacts are then advanced: individual empowerment, better collaborative systems for sorting and categorizing information, and the use of artificial intelligence assistants that could guide users through the informational space of today's Internet.

TI  - Taking the Person Seriously: Ethically Aware IS Research in the Era of Reinforcement Learning-Based Personalization
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - Advances in reinforcement learning and implicit data collection on large-scale commercial platforms mark the beginning of a new era of personalization aimed at the adaptive control of human user environments. We present five emergent features of this new paradigm of personalization that endanger persons and societies at scale and analyze their potential to reduce personal autonomy, destabilize social and political systems, and facilitate mass surveillance and social control, among other concerns. We argue that current data protection laws, most notably the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, are limited in their ability to adequately address many of these issues. Nevertheless, we believe that IS researchers are well-situated to engage with and investigate this new era of personalization. We propose three distinct directions for ethically aware reinforcement learning-based personalization research uniquely suited to the strengths of IS researchers across the sociotechnical spectrum.

TI  - Burden of Proof in Deliberation Dialogs
T2  - ARGUMENTATION IN MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS
CP  - 6th International Workshop on Argumentation in Multi-Agent Systems
AB  - The literature in argumentation and artificial intelligence has distinguished five types of burden of proof in persuasion dialogs, but there appears to have been no serious investigation so far on how burdens of proof should be modeled in deliberation dialogs. The work in this paper is directed toward filling that gap by extending existing formal models of deliberation dialog to analyze four examples of deliberation dialog where burden of proof is at issue or poses an interesting problem. The examples are used to show (1) that the eight stages in the formal model of Hitchcock, McBurney and Parsons (2007) need to be divided into three more general stages, an opening stage, an argumentation stage and a closing stage, (2) that deliberation dialog shifts to persuasion dialog during the argumentation stage, and (3) that burden of proof is only operative during the argumentation stage. What is shown in general is that deliberation is, in the typical type of case, a mixed dialog in which there is a shift to persuasion dialog in the middle.

TI  - An Improved and Adaptive Approach in ANFIS to Predict Knee Diseases
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND INFORMATICS
AB  - Artificial intelligence is emerging as a persuasive tool in the field of medical science. This research work also primarily focuses on the development of a tool to automate the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of the knee joint. The tool will also assist the physicians and medical practitioners for diagnosis. The diseases considered for this research under inflammatory category are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteonecrosis. A five-layer adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) architecture was used to model the system. The ANFIS system works by mapping input parameters to the input membership functions, input membership functions are mapped to the rules generated by the ANFIS model which are further mapped to the output membership function. A comparative performance analysis of fuzzy system and ANFIS system is also done and results generated shows that the ANFIS system outperformed fuzzy system in terms of testing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

TI  - Modelling the Affective Power of Locutions in a Persuasive Dialogue Game
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND SOFT COMPUTING (ICAISC 2018), PT II
CP  - 17th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing (ICAISC)
AB  - One of the most important contemporary directions of development in the field of artificial intelligence is to equip AI systems with emotional intelligence. This work is part of this trend. The paper presents a mathematical model that allows us to describe changes in players' emotional states as a response to dialogue actions. To this end, we use the paradigm of dialogue games and propose a method of rating locutions. The method is inspired by the affective rating system SAM which uses Mehrabian's PAD space which distinguishes emotions because of three attributes: Pleasantness (valence) (P), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Emotions that are analyzed are taken from Ekman's model with five universally accepted labels: fear, disgust, anger, sadness, and joy. In addition, we describe the emerging tool for the realization of dialogue games with emotional reasoning. This tool is the basis for designing a system for verifying the properties of dialog protocols.

TI  - How intelligent neurotechnology can be epistemically unjust. An exploration into the ethics of algorithms
T2  - REVIEW OF SOCIAL ECONOMY
AB  - Recently, the epistemic quality of algorithms and its normative implications have come under scrutiny. While general questions of justice have been addressed in this context, specific issues of epistemic (in)justice have so far been neglected. We aim to fill this gap by analyzing some potential implications of behavioral intelligent neurotechnology (B-INT). We claim that B-INT exhibits a number of epistemic features implying the potential for certain epistemic problems, which, in turn, are likely to result in instances of epistemic injustice. To support this claim, we will first introduce and specify the terminology and technology behind B-INT. Second, we will present four fictitious scenarios of using B-INT and highlight a number of epistemic issues that might arise. Third, we will discuss their relation to the concept of epistemic justice, as well as potential instances thereof. Thus, we will show some important and morally relevant implications of the epistemic properties of INT.

TI  - Effect of disclosing AI-generated content on prosocial advertising evaluation
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - With advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, there is a growing concern about its ethical implications, transparency, and consumer reactions to AI-generated content. Building on the persuasion knowledge model and algorithm aversion literature, this study explores the effects of AI disclosure in prosocial advertising on consumer attitudes and donation intentions. The findings of Study 1 indicate that the initial disclosure of AI-generated content leads to unfavourable attitudes towards ads, with perceived ad credibility serving as a mediating factor. In Study 2, participants who perceived AI as more human-like rather than machine-like tended to experience a diminished negative impact of AI disclosure. Study 3 also highlights the crucial role of perceived ad credibility in influencing donation intentions following the disclosure of AI-generated content. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings for social marketers and nonprofit organizations are discussed further.

TI  - Experience design
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY & BEHAVIOR
AB  - It is essential to think about education online as comprehensively as possible. Experience design offers designers of online courses a comprehensive model informed by research and development in a number of areas that can provide a foundation for the effective design of online experiences that are functional and purposeful-and also engaging, compelling, memorable, and enjoyable. Experience design is an ancient practice, going back to the earliest human impulse to develop rituals, ceremonies, drama, and even architecture. But the design of experiences has become much more pervasive during the twentieth century. Media has played a central role, including radio, television, multimedia, and virtual reality. But experience design is also informed by new ideas in economics, especially Pine and Gilmore's notion of the emerging experience economy. And it draws upon ideas from artificial intelligence, the psychology of optimal experiences, sociology, and other areas, including electronic commerce, persuasive, human-computer interface design, drama, and digital storytelling. This article discusses key concepts and theories from all of these areas and explains how they can be adapted to the design of online learning experiences.

TI  - Lights, camera, engagement! The role of personalized video as a marketing strategy in capturing consumer attention
T2  - JOURNAL OF MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - Personalized video marketing is increasingly leveraged as advertisers employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to tailor content to target audiences. Grounded in self-reference theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this study examines the impact of video personalization on consumer engagement. Partnering with Vidyard, a video hosting platform, we analyzed historical video data to assess how personalized content influences persuasion pathways. Using a mixed-methods approach, we identified significant differences in engagement and elaboration between personalized and non-personalized videos. Findings indicate that personalized videos yield higher message downloads, rewatch likelihood, and click-through rates, aligning with central processing. Additionally, open-ended surveys from firms using personalized video identified three key benefits: increased engagement, heightened viewer attention, and competitive differentiation. The study concludes with a comparative analysis of results and discusses both theoretical and managerial implications.

T2  - 2019 IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COGNITIVE AND COMPUTATIONAL ASPECTS OF SITUATION MANAGEMENT (COGSIMA)
CP  - IEEE International Conference on Cognitive and Computational Aspects of Situation Management (CogSIMA)
AB  - Decision support systems (DSS), which are often based on complex statistical, machine learning, and AI models, have increasingly become a core part of data analytics and sensemaking processes. Automation complacency - a state characterized by over-trust in intelligent systems - has the potential to result in catastrophic performance failure. An under-investigated factor in automation complacency research is the effect that DSS might have on human learning of domain concepts. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of two studies of users interacting with decision aids to understand how knowledge retention is affected by the competence and presentation of a DSS. Our results indicate that while humans have the opportunity to learn and internalize domain concepts while being supported by a DSS, features that make the DSS appear more competent, persuasive, or customizable may lead a user to form incorrect beliefs about a domain.

TI  - The missing media The procedural rhetoric of computer games
T2  - PUBLIC RELATIONS REVIEW
AB  - The discussion about the implications of new or digital media focuses mainly on 'social' media. This reduction is a conceptual shortcoming. In order to fully understand how digital media impact on society and the communication landscape, our conceptualisation needs to include new entertainment media, especially computer games. Interactivity here might mean interaction with the AI (artificial-intelligence) or human players. or both, but the crucial difference lies in the fact that the interaction takes place in a 'world' created by the software. Despite the discussion about 'gamification' in marketing and a tradition of game studies in the humanities, there have been few attempts to treat computer games not only as trivial culture, but as a "persuasive device", as a way to shape public opinion. This article explores how the theory of procedural rhetoric, as outlined by Ian Bogost, enhances our understanding of this growing area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Algorithms and Complexity Results for Persuasive Argumentation
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF ARGUMENT: PROCEEDINGS OF COMMA 2010
CP  - 3rd Conference on Computational Models of Argument
AB  - Value-based argumentation frameworks, as introduced by Bench-Capon, allow the abstract representation of persuasive argumentation. This formalism takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ordering which represents an audience. Deciding subjective or objective acceptance (i.e., acceptance with respect to at least one or with respect to all orderings) are intractable computational problems.
   In this paper we study the computational complexity of testing the subjective or objective acceptance for problem instances that obey certain restrictions. We consider structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graph structure of the value-based argumentation framework and in terms of properties of the equivalence relation formed by arguments with the same relative strength. We identify new tractable fragments where subjective and objective acceptance can be tested in polynomial time. Furthermore we show the intractability of some fragments that are located at the boundary to tractability. Our results disprove two conjectures of Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007).

TI  - AI-determined similarity increases likability and trustworthiness of human voices
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology is capable of generating human sounding voices that could be used to deceive recipients in various contexts (e.g., deep fakes). Given the increasing accessibility of this technology and its potential societal implications, the present study conducted online experiments using original data to investigate the validity of AI-based voice similarity measures and their impact on trustworthiness and likability. Correlation analyses revealed that voiceprints - numerical representations of voices derived from a speaker verification system - can be used to approximate human (dis)similarity ratings. With regard to cognitive evaluations, we observed that voices similar to one's own voice increased trustworthiness and likability, whereas average voices did not elicit such effects. These findings suggest a preference for self-similar voices and underscore the risks associated with the misuse of AI in generating persuasive artificial voices from brief voice samples.

TI  - Can AI tell good stories? Narrative transportation and persuasion with ChatGPT
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - Storytelling is a human universal. The ubiquity of stories and the rapid development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) pose important questions: can AI like ChatGPT tell engaging and persuasive stories? If so, what makes a narrative engaging and persuasive? Three pre-registered experiments comparing human-generated narratives from existing research and the ChatGPT-generated versions using descriptions and materials from these studies show that labeling AI as a narrative source led to lower transportation, higher counterarguing, and lower story-consistent beliefs. However, AI-generated narratives led to lower (Study 1 and 3) or similar levels (Study 2) of counterarguing than the human-generated version. Readers showed lower (Study 2) or similar levels of transportation (Study 1 and 3) when reading the AI- than the human-generated stories. We suggest the AI model's linguistic competence and logical coherence contribute to its stories' verisimilitude. However, AI's lack of lived experience and creativity may limit its storytelling ability.

TI  - Deepest Mediatization? Inventing the Autonomous Vehicle
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB  - The fully autonomous vehicle (AV) promises to be both a prototypic example of deep mediatization in the built environment and the apotheosis of the mediatized automobile. Autonomy has been an elusive goal, however. Its achievement will depend on a persuasive sociotechnical imaginary (STI), along with breakthroughs in digital technology. The latter involve advanced artificial intelligence, of course, but also the transformation of the nature of media, a dynamic that goes well beyond the mere proliferation of in-car media. After exploring "media" and automotive deep mediatization, this article dwells on neglected examples of existing mobile autonomy. It then turns to STIs in general, which are visionary articulations of pioneering communities, and the American AV STI in particular. This is constructed through a close reading of recent semipopular publications that mostly promote the desirability of vehicular autonomy. The article concludes critically, with analysis of the unpersuasiveness of the current American AV STI, the vehicle in AV, and the transformation of media.

AB  - A natural conversational interface that allows longitudinal symptom tracking would be extremely valuable in health/wellness applications. However, the task of designing emotionally-aware agents for behavior change is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of an emotion-aware chatbot that conducts experience sampling in an empathetic manner. We evaluate it through a human-subject experiment with N=39 participants over the course of a week. Our results show that extraverts preferred the emotion-aware chatbot significantly more than introverts. Also, participants reported a higher percentage of positive mood reports when interacting with the empathetic bot. Finally, we provide guidelines for the design of emotion-aware chatbots for potential use in mHealth contexts.

TI  - Integration of ChatGPT Into a Course for Medical Students:Explorative Study on Teaching Scenarios, Students'Perception, and Applications
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Text-generating artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT offers many opportunities and challenges inmedical education. Acquiring practical skills necessary for using AI in a clinical context is crucial, especially for medicaleducation.Objective: This explorative study aimed to investigate the feasibility of integrating ChatGPT into teaching units and toevaluate the course and the importance of AI-related competencies for medical students. Since a possible application ofChatGPT in the medical field could be the generation of information for patients, we further investigated how such informationis perceived by students in terms of persuasiveness and quality.Methods: ChatGPT was integrated into 3 different teaching units of a blended learning course for medical students. Usinga mixed methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected. As baseline data, we assessed students' character-istics, including their openness to digital innovation. The students evaluated the integration of ChatGPT into the course andshared their thoughts regarding the future of text-generating AI in medical education. The course was evaluated based on theKirkpatrick Model, with satisfaction, learning progress, and applicable knowledge considered as key assessment levels. InChatGPT-integrating teaching units, students evaluated videos featuring information for patients regarding their persuasivenesson treatment expectations in a self-experience experiment and critically reviewed information for patients written usingChatGPT 3.5 based on different prompts.Results: A total of 52 medical students participated in the study. The comprehensive evaluation of the course revealedelevated levels of satisfaction, learning progress, and applicability specifically in relation to the ChatGPT-integrating teachingunits. Furthermore, all evaluation levels demonstrated an association with each other. Higher openness to digital innovationwas associated with higher satisfaction and, to a lesser extent, with higher applicability. AI-related competencies in othercourses of the medical curriculum were perceived as highly important by medical students. Qualitative analysis highlightedpotential use cases of ChatGPT in teaching and learning. In ChatGPT-integrating teaching units, students rated informationfor patients generated using a basic ChatGPT prompt as "moderate" in terms of comprehensibility, patient safety, and thecorrect application of communication rules taught during the course. The students' ratings were considerably improved usingan extended prompt. The same text, however, showed the smallest increase in treatment expectations when compared withinformation provided by humans (patient, clinician, and expert) via videos.Conclusions: This study offers valuable insights into integrating the development of AI competencies into a blended learningcourse. Integration of ChatGPT enhanced learning experiences for medical students

CP  - ACM Conference on Equity and Access in Algorithms, Mechanisms, and Optimization (EAAMO)
AB  - Manipulation is a concern in many domains, such as social media, advertising, and chatbots. As AI systems mediate more of our digital interactions, it is important to understand the degree to which AI systems might manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Our work clarifies challenges in defining and measuring this kind of manipulation from AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation and characterize the space of possible notions of manipulation, which we find to depend upon the concepts of incentives, intent, covertness, and harm. We review proposals on how to operationalize each concept and we outline challenges in including each concept in a definition of manipulation. Second, we discuss the connections between manipulation and related concepts, such as deception and coercion. We then analyze how our characterization of manipulation applies to recommender systems and language models, and give a brief overview of the regulation of manipulation in other domains. While some progress has been made in defining and measuring manipulation from AI systems, many gaps remain. In the absence of a consensus definition and reliable tools for measurement, we cannot rule out the possibility that AI systems learn to manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Manipulation could pose a significant threat to human autonomy and precautionary actions to mitigate it are likely warranted.

TI  - Knowledge of automated journalism moderates evaluations of algorithmically generated news
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB  - Drawing on propositions from the HAII-TIME (Human-artificial intelligence [AI] Interaction and the Theory of Interactive Media Effects) and Persuasion Knowledge Model, this study examines how knowledge of automated journalism (AJ) moderates the evaluation of algorithmically generated news. Experiment 1 demonstrates the utility of process-related knowledge in user evaluations of agency: individuals with little knowledge of AJ prefer attributions of human authorship over news stories attributed to algorithms, whereas individuals with high AJ knowledge have an equal or stronger preference for news that is described as algorithmically generated. Experiment 2 conditions these effects to show how prior characterizations of AJ-whether more machine- or human-like-shape evaluations of algorithmically generated news contingent on user age and knowledge level. Effects are found for differing age groups at lower levels of AJ knowledge, where machine-like characterizations enhance evaluations of algorithmically generated news for younger users but ascribing human-like traits enhances evaluations of automated news for older users.

TI  - To Tell or Not to Tell: Investigating the Persuasive Appeal of Information Transparency for AR-Powered E-Commerce Sites
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
AB  - In e-commerce, Augmented Reality (AR) employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance the shopping experience through personalized recommendations based on users' physical data. However, concerns regarding privacy and perceived intrusiveness can undermine the persuasive appeal of personalized AR for e-commerce experiences. Can overtly communicating information transparency mitigate such concerns? Two between-subjects online experiments were conducted, revealing that consumers were drawn to the AR-powered e-commerce site due to its heightened perceived immersion and usefulness but also considered it more intrusive than the non-AR site. However, when both websites were AR-powered, the one with high information transparency significantly enhanced perceived privacy protection, reducing perceived intrusiveness. Perceived transparency positively mediated the effects, particularly among individuals with lower pre-existing trust in algorithms. These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of AR in strategic communications and the design of information transparency for AR-powered e-commerce.

TI  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model-Based Explainable Recommender
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTANCE EDUCATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB  - Explainable recommendation, which provides an explanation about why a quiz is recommended, helps to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, little research examined the effectiveness of the explainable recommender, especially on academic performance. To survey its effectiveness, the authors evaluate the math academic performance among middle school students (n=115) by giving pre- and post-test questions based evaluation techniques. During the pre- and post-test periods, students were encouraged to use the Bayesian Knowledge Tracing model based explainable recommendation system. To evaluate how well the students were able to do what they could not do, the authors defined growth rate and found recommended quiz clicked counts had a positive effect on the total number of solved quizzes (R=0.343, P=0.005) and growth rate (R=0.297, P=0.017) despite no correlation between the total number of solved quizzes and growth rate. The results suggest that the use of an explainable recommendation system that learns efficiently will enable students to do what they could not do before.

To establish trust in AI systems, there is a need for users to understand the reasoning behind their solutions. Therefore, systems should be able to explain and justify their output. Explainable AI Planning is a field that involves explaining the outputs, i.e., solution plans produced by AI planning systems to a user. The main goal of a plan explanation is to help humans understand reasoning behind the plans that are produced by the planners. In this article, we propose an argument scheme-based approach to provide explanations in the domain of AI planning. We present novel argument schemes to create arguments that explain a plan and its key elements and a set of critical questions that allow interaction between the arguments and enable the user to obtain further information regarding the key elements of the plan. Furthermore, we present a novel dialogue system using the argument schemes and critical questions for providing interactive dialectical explanations.

TI  - On the Computation of Top-k Extensions in Abstract Argumentation Frameworks
T2  - ECAI 2016: 22ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
CP  - 22nd European Conference on Artificial Intelligence (ECAI)
AB  - Formal argumentation has received a lot of attention during the last two decades, since abstract argumentation framework provides the basis for various reasoning problems in Artificial Intelligence. Unfortunately, the exponential number of its possible semantics extensions makes some reasoning problems intractable in this framework. In this paper, we investigate the pivotal issue of efficient computation of acceptable arguments called extensions according to a given semantics. In particular, we address this aspect by applying a strategy of how to use preferences at the semantics level in order to determine what are "desirable" outcomes of the argumentation process. Then, we present a new approach for computing the Top-k extensions of an abstract argumentation framework, according to a user-specified preference relation. Indeed, an extension is a Top-k extension for a given semantics if it admits less than k extensions preferred to it with respect to a preference relation. Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of our approach and the accuracy of the proposed enumeration method.

TI  - Multi-Modal Dialogue Policy Learning for Dynamic and Co-operative Goal Setting
T2  - 2021 INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON NEURAL NETWORKS (IJCNN)
CP  - International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN)
AB  - Developing an adequate and human-like virtual agent has been one of the primary applications of artificial intelligence. In the last few years, task-oriented dialogue systems have gained huge popularity because of their upsurging relevance and positive outcomes. In real-world, users may not always have a predefined and rigid task goal beforehand; they upgrade/downgrade/change their goal component dynamically depending upon their utility value and agent's serving capability. However, existing virtual agents fail to incorporate this dynamic behavior, leading to either unsuccessful task completion or an ungratified user experience. The paper presents an end to end multimodal dialogue system for dynamic and co-operative goal setting, which incorporates i) a multi-modal semantic state representation in policy learning to deal with multi-modal inputs, ii) a goal manager module in a traditional dialogue manager for handling dynamic and goal unavailability scenarios effectively, iii) an accumulative reward (task/persona/sentiment) for task success, personalized persuasion and user-adaptive behavior, respectively. The obtained experimental results and the comparisons with baselines firmly establish the need and efficacy of the proposed system.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 18TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC EVALUATION, SEMEVAL-2024
CP  - 18th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)
AB  - Memes are commonly used in online disinformation campaigns, particularly on social media platforms. They are primarily effective on social media platforms since they can easily reach many users. Semeval2024-Task4(Dimitrov et al., 2024), "Multilingual detection of persuasion techniques in memes", focuses on detecting persuasive methods across four languages: English, Bulgarian, North Macedonian and Arabic. Subtask 1 aims to identify the given text fragments of memes and which of the 20 persuasion techniques it uses, organized in a hierarchy. For the difficulty of this task and the fundamental role of text in the artificial intelligence area, we concentrate solely on this task. We develop a system using CoT-based data augmentation methods,in-domain pretraining and ensemble strategy that combines the strengths of both RoBERTa and DeBERTa models. Our solution achieved the top ranking among 33 teams in the English track during the official assessments. We also analyze the impact of architectural decisions, data construction and training strategies. We release our code at https://github.com/ldlbest/semeval2024-task4

TI  - Disparate Impact Diminishes Consumer Trust Even for Advantaged Users
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2021)
CP  - 16th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (Persuasive)
AB  - Systems aiming to aid consumers in their decision-making (e.g., by implementing persuasive techniques) are more likely to be effective when consumers trust them. However, recent research has demonstrated that the machine learning algorithms that often underlie such technology can act unfairly towards specific groups (e.g., by making more favorable predictions for men than for women). An undesired disparate impact resulting from this kind of algorithmic unfairness could diminish consumer trust and thereby undermine the purpose of the system. We studied this effect by conducting a between-subjects user study investigating how (gender-related) disparate impact affected consumer trust in an app designed to improve consumers' financial decision-making. Our results show that disparate impact decreased consumers' trust in the system and made them less likely to use it. Moreover, we find that trust was affected to the same degree across consumer groups (i.e., advantaged and disadvantaged users) despite both of these consumer groups recognizing their respective levels of personal benefit. Our findings highlight the importance of fairness in consumer-oriented artificial intelligence systems.

TI  - Towards Demystifying Subliminal Persuasiveness: Using XAI-Techniques to Highlight Persuasive Markers of Public Speeches
T2  - EXPLAINABLE, TRANSPARENT AUTONOMOUS AGENTS AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS (EXTRAAMAS 2020)
CP  - 2nd International Workshop on Explainable, Transparent Autonomous Agents and Multi-Agent Systems (EXTRAAMAS)
AB  - The literature provides evidence for the importance of nonverbal cues when it comes to persuading other people and developing persuasive robots. Mostly, people use these non-verbal cues subconsciously and, more importantly, are not aware of the subliminal impact of them. To raise awareness of subliminal persuasion and to explore a way for investigating persuasive cues for the development of persuasive robots and agents, we have analyzed videos of political public speeches and trained a neural network capable of predicting the degree of perceived convincingness based on visual input only. We then created visualizations of the predictions by making use of the explainable artificial intelligence methods Grad-CAM and layer-wise relevance propagation that highlight the most relevant image sections and markers. Our results show that the neural network learned to focus on the person, more specifically their posture and contours, as well as on their hands and face. These results are in line with existing literature and, thus, show the practical potential of our approach.

TI  - Explanation in AI and law: Past, present and future
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Explanation has been a central feature of AI systems for legal reasoning since their inception. Recently, the topic of explanation of decisions has taken on a new urgency, throughout AI in general, with the increasing deployment of AI tools and the need for lay users to be able to place trust in the decisions that the support tools are recommending. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the variety of techniques for explanation that have been developed in AI and Law. We summarise the early contributions and how these have since developed. We describe a number of notable current methods for automated explanation of legal reasoning and we also highlight gaps that must be addressed by future systems to ensure that accurate, trustworthy, unbiased decision support can be provided to legal professionals. We believe that insights from AI and Law, where explanation has long been a concern, may provide useful pointers for future development of explainable AI. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Lessons on Using Computationally Generated Influence for Shaping Narrative Experiences
T2  - IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND AI IN GAMES
AB  - In this paper, we present computational models for generating influence that allow story managers to shape players' decisions in interactive narrative experiences. Our approach uses concepts from social psychology, discourse analysis, and natural language generation. We describe an abstract formalism to operationalize tools of social psychological influence described by Cialdini (Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, NewYork, NY, USA: Harper-Collins, 1998) and evaluate two example implementations that enable a storytelling system to generate influence on the fly (with varying degrees of success), thereby adapting stories to realize goals specified by authors. These implementations are used in an interactive story where influence is generated dynamically as players' experiences unfold. We present the results of a user study to characterize the effectiveness of these models. Results did not indicate the presence of any significant differences in players' sense of control over the story with, or without, the use of influence. Further, the use of influence resulted in a set of stories experienced by players that more closely matched the author's goals.

TI  - First encounter with robot Alpha: How individual differences interact with vocal and kinetic cues in users' social responses
T2  - NEW MEDIA & SOCIETY
AB  - The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm was proposed more than two decades ago to understand humans' interaction with computer technologies. Today, as emerging technologies like social robots become more personal and persuasive, questions of how users respond to them socially, what individual factors leverage the relationship, and what constitutes the social influence of these technologies need to be addressed. A lab experiment was conducted to examine the interactions between individual differences and social robots' vocal and kinetic cues. Results suggested that users developed more trust in a social robot with a human voice than with a synthetic voice. Users also developed more intimacy and interest in the social robot when it was paired with humanlike gestures. Moreover, individual differences including users' gender, attitudes toward robots, and robot exposure affected their psychological responses. The theoretical, practical, and ethical value of the findings was further discussed in the study.

TI  - An Empirical Study on Group Fairness Metrics of Judicial Data
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - Group fairness means that different groups have an equal probability of being predicted for one aspect. It is a significant fairness definition, which is conducive to maintaining social harmony and stability. Fairness is a vital issue when an artificial intelligence software system is used to make judicial decisions. Either data or algorithm alone may lead to unfair results. Determining the fairness of the dataset is a prerequisite for studying the fairness of algorithms. This paper focuses on the dataset to research group fairness from both micro and macro views. We propose a framework to determine the sensitive attributes of a dataset and metrics to measure the fair degree of sensitive attributes. We conducted experiments and statistical analysis of the judicial data to demonstrate the framework and metric approach better. The framework and metric approach can be applied to datasets of other domains, providing persuasive evidence for the effectiveness and availability of algorithmic fairness research. It opens up a new way for the research of the fairness of the dataset.

TI  - Goal Setting for Persuasive Information Systems: Five Reference Checklists
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY: DEVELOPMENT OF PERSUASIVE AND BEHAVIOR CHANGE SUPPORT SYSTEMS, PERSUASIVE 2019
CP  - 14th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - The concept of goals is prominent in information systems and also artificial intelligence literature such as goal-oriented requirements engineering and self-adaptive systems. Digital motivation systems, e.g. gamification and persuasive technology, utilise the concept of behavioural goals which require a different mind-set on how to elicit and set them up, how to monitor deviation from such goals and how to ensure their completion. Behavioural goals are characterised by a range of factors which are not the main focus in classic information systems and AI literature such as self-efficacy, perceived usefulness. To engineer software supporting goal setting, a concretised taxonomy of goals would help a better-managed analysis and design process. In this paper, we provide a detailed classification of behavioural goals and their associated properties and elements (types, sources, monitoring, feedback, deviation and countermeasures). As a method, we review the literature on goal setting theory and its application in different disciplines. We subsequently develop five reference checklists which would act as a reference point for researchers and practitioners in persuasive and motivational systems.

T2  - DIGITAL INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP (AMCIS 2021)
CP  - 27th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems (AMCIS)
AB  - Persuasive designs, including gamification and digital nudging, have become well renowned during the last years and have been implemented successfully across different sectors including education, e-health, e-governance, e-finance and general information systems. In this regard, persuasive design can support desirable changes in attitude and behavior of users in order to achieve their own goals. However, such persuasive influence on individuals raises ethical questions as persuasive designs can impair the autonomy of users or persuade the user towards goals of a third party and hence lead to unethical decision-making processes. In human-computer interaction this is especially significant with the advent of advanced artificial intelligence that can emulate human behavior and thus bring new dynamics into play. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature analysis with the goal to compile an overview of ethical considerations for persuasive system design, derive potential guidelines for ethical persuasive designs and shed light on potential research gaps.

TI  - Artificial Authorship and Judicial Opinions
T2  - GEORGE WASHINGTON LAW REVIEW
AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence ("AI") is already beginning to alter legal practice. If optimistic forecasts prove warranted, how might this technology transform judicial opinions-a genre often viewed as central to the law? This Symposium Essay attempts to answer that predictive question, which sheds light on present realities. In brief, the provision of opinions will become cheaper and, relatedly, more widely and evenly supplied. Judicial writings will often be zestier, more diverse, and less deliberative. And as the legal system's economy of persuasive ability is disrupted, courts will engage in a sort of arms race with the public: judges will use artificially enhanced rhetoric to promote their own legitimacy, and the public will become more cynical to avoid being fooled. Paradoxically, a surfeit of persuasive rhetoric could render legal reasoning itself obsolete. In response to these developments, some courts may disallow AI writing tools so that they can continue to claim the authority that flows from authorship. Potential stakes thus include both the fate of legal reason and the future of human participation in the legal system.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED LOGICS-IFCOLOG JOURNAL OF LOGICS AND THEIR APPLICATIONS
AB  - Argument Mining (AM) is the research area aiming at extracting natural language arguments and their relations from text, with the final goal of providing machine-processable structured data for computational models of argument. This research topic has started to attract the attention of a small community of researchers around 2014, and it is nowadays counted as one of the most promising research areas in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing in terms of growing of the community, funded projects, and involvement of companies. Recently, this research area includes also further forms of processing natural language arguments than mining, i.e., searching for arguments on the Web, argument generation and synthesis, and assessing the quality of arguments with respect to specific criteria like persuasiveness. In this chapter, we start by describing the classic argument mining tasks, and then we present the new tasks proposed lately in the literature. We discuss the obtained results in the area from a data-driven perspective. An open discussion highlights the main weaknesses suffered by the existing work in the literature, and proposes open challenges to be faced in the future.

TI  - Scaling up interactive argumentation by providing counterarguments with a chatbot
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
AB  - In a Registered Report, Altay et al. find that learning about the scientific consensus on genetically modified organisms (GMOs) reduces the gap between public opinion and scientists. This gap is also narrowed, to a greater extent, by reading counterarguments to anti-GMO arguments in a chatbot or in a list.
   Discussion is more convincing than standard, unidirectional messaging, but its interactive nature makes it difficult to scale up. We created a chatbot to emulate the most important traits of discussion. A simple argument pointing out the existence of a scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) already led to more positive attitudes towards GMOs, compared with a control message. Providing participants with good arguments rebutting the most common counterarguments against GMOs led to much more positive attitudes towards GMOs, whether the participants could immediately see all the arguments or could select the most relevant arguments in a chatbot. Participants holding the most negative attitudes displayed more attitude change in favour of GMOs. Participants updated their beliefs when presented with good arguments, but we found no evidence that an interactive chatbot proves more persuasive than a list of arguments and counterarguments.

T2  - 2017 40TH INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION ON INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGY, ELECTRONICS AND MICROELECTRONICS (MIPRO)
CP  - 40th International Convention on Information and Communication Technology, Electronics and Microelectronics (MIPRO)
AB  - Captology is an acronym, derived from Computer As Persuasive TechnOLOGY, where the instance persuasive, (lat. persuasibilibus - enticing), refers to the convincing persuasion caused by computer technology. Transitive and interactive technologies as intelligent systems, have imposed, by their persuasivity, "the cult of information", after which the information became type of goods that as utilitarian resource need to be quickly and efficiently exploited. Such widely accepted fact resulted as hype, presenting perspective that approach to large amount of information and faster "digestion" of their content and sense will enable users to quickly get desired knowledge. Intelligent systems are ubiquitous in almost all segments of society and life, although there are no relevant researches to confirm the claims of all their acceptability. The paper presents the results of research and testing processes of computer persuasion to show that its success is primarily dependent on its factors. The design for "cloud work", interactive computer programs, web, desktop and other factors directly affect the user, and its attitudes, beliefs, learning and behavior. That impact can be positive or negative.

TI  - Designing Behavior Change Support Systems Targeting Blood Donation Behavior
T2  - BUSINESS & INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENGINEERING
AB  - While blood is crucial for many surgeries and patient treatments worldwide, it cannot be produced artificially. Fulfilling the demand for blood products on average days is already a major challenge in countries like South Africa and Ghana. In these countries, less than 1 % of the population donates blood and most of the donations come from first-time donors who do not return. Sufficient new, first-time and even lapsed donors must be motivated to donate regularly. This study argues that blood donation behavior change support systems (BDBCSS) can be beneficially applied to support blood donor management in African countries. In this study, the design science research (DSR) approach is applied in order to derive generic design principles for BDBCSS and instantiate the design knowledge in prototypes for a blood donation app and a chatbot. The design principles were evaluated in a field study in South Africa. The results demonstrate the positive effects of BDBCSS on users' intentional and developmental blood donation behavior. This study contributes to research and practice by proposing a new conceptualization of blood donation information systems support and a nascent design theory for BDBCSS that builds on behavioral theories as well as related work on blood donation information systems. Thus, the study provides valuable implications for designing preventive health BCSS by stating three design principles for a concrete application context in healthcare.

T2  - JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS
AB  - Background: Individuals with disabilities living with chronic health conditions require self-management programs that are accessible, sustainable, inclusive, and adaptable. Health coaching is an effective approach to promoting behavior change in self-management. Health coaching combined with telehealth technology has the potential to improve the overall quality of, and access to, health services.Objective: This protocol outlines the study design for implementing the My Health, My Life, My Way intervention. The study will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention for people with disabilities and optimize it.Methods: The My Health, My Life, My Way study is a 4-arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the delivery of a 6-month intervention involving telecoaching, inclusive educational content, and technology access for 200 individuals with chronic conditions and physical disabilities. This study uses the engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to evaluate intervention components and assess whether a combination or lack of individual elements influences behavior. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 study arms: scheduled coaching calls and gamified rewards, no scheduled coaching calls and gamified rewards, scheduled coaching calls and flat rewards, and no scheduled coaching calls and flat rewards.Results: The My Health, My Life, My Way study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and recruitment and enrollment will begin in May 2023. Data analysis is expected to be completed within 6 months of ending data collection. This clinical trial protocol was developed based on the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 statement.Conclusions: The My Health, My Life, My Way study will help to optimize and improve our understanding of the feasibility and efficacy of a web-based self-management program for people with physical disabilities and chronic conditions. More specifically, My Health, My Life, My Way will determine which combination of interventions (coaching calls and gamification) will result in increased participation in self-management programming. The My Health, My Life, My Way intervention has the potential to become a scalable and novel method to successfully manage chronic conditions in people with disabilities.

TI  - Experiences of a Motivational Interview Delivered by a Robot: Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Motivational interviewing is an effective intervention for supporting behavior change but traditionally depends on face-to-face dialogue with a human counselor. This study addressed a key challenge for the goal of developing social robotic motivational interviewers: creating an interview protocol, within the constraints of current artificial intelligence, which participants will find engaging and helpful.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore participants' qualitative experiences of a motivational interview delivered by a social robot, including their evaluation of usability of the robot during the interaction and its impact on their motivation.
   Methods: NAO robots are humanoid, child-sized social robots. We programmed a NAO robot with Choregraphe software to deliver a scripted motivational interview focused on increasing physical activity. The interview was designed to be comprehensible even without an empathetic response from the robot. Robot breathing and face-tracking functions were used to give an impression of attentiveness. A total of 20 participants took part in the robot-delivered motivational interview and evaluated it after 1 week by responding to a series of written open-ended questions. Each participant was left alone to speak aloud with the robot, advancing through a series of questions by tapping the robot's head sensor. Evaluations were content-analyzed utilizing Boyatzis' steps: (1) sampling and design, (2) developing themes and codes, and (3) validating and applying the codes.
   Results: Themes focused on interaction with the robot, motivation, change in physical activity, and overall evaluation of the intervention. Participants found the instructions clear and the navigation easy to use. Most enjoyed the interaction but also found it was restricted by the lack of individualized response from the robot. Many positively appraised the nonjudgmental aspect of the interview and how it gave space to articulate their motivation for change. Some participants felt that the intervention increased their physical activity levels.
   Conclusions: Social robots can achieve a fundamental objective of motivational interviewing, encouraging participants to articulate their goals and dilemmas aloud. Because they are perceived as nonjudgmental, robots may have advantages over more humanoid avatars for delivering virtual support for behavioral change.

TI  - Artificial emotions for charity collection: A serial mediation through perceived anthropomorphism and social presence
T2  - TELEMATICS AND INFORMATICS
AB  - Despite the broad application of chatbot agents in online interactions, an ongoing debate persists regarding their persuasive role and human-like emotional disclosure. Our study adds to this debate by exploring the effect of chatbot agents' emotional disclosure on people's willingness to donate to a charitable cause, and by examining individual and serial mediation between the main effects of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. To this end, two types of artificial intelligence chatbot agents-one disclosing factual information and another disclosing human-like emotion-were developed and trained using Dialogflow, a natural language processing en-gine. A total of 619 US residents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Of these, 593 participants completed the required conversation with either version of the chatbot agent (factual vs. emotional), as well as the survey questionnaire, and therefore, were included in the final analysis. The participants exhibited a higher willingness to donate when they interacted with a chatbot disclosing human-like emotions than when they were only exposed to factual information. Moreover, this study found both individual and serial mediating roles of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. Concerning the implications, theoretically, this study adds to the understanding of applying the notion of human interaction to that involving humans and chatbots. Practically, our findings can be of great help in increasing willingness to donate thereby enhancing fund-raising activities.

TI  - Towards Ethical Argumentative Persuasive Chatbots
T2  - COORDINATION, ORGANIZATIONS, INSTITUTIONS, NORMS, AND ETHICS FOR GOVERNANCE OF MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS XVI, COINE 2023
CP  - 27th International Workshop on Coordination, Organizations, Institutions, Norms, and Ethics for Governance of Multi-Agent Systems (COINE)
AB  - Argumentative persuasive technologies are technologies that use argumentation in order to persuade the persuadee to believe in something or not, which can later lead the persuadee to perform an action or not. The use of such tools opens numerous ethical considerations. In this paper, we survey the literature on persuasion that might be useful for argumentative persuasive chatbots, we cover the existing legal framework and ethical principles and we critically analyze the new proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence of the European Commission. We also show how to use argumentation to enhance explainability and transparency of the persuasion systems. We propose to show the graphical representation of the arguments used during the persuasion to the user at the end of the dialogue, containing the relations between the arguments (attacks, supports), their origin (source), who uttered them (i.e. the machine or the human participant) and the persuasive methods employed. Our approach has several benefits. Namely, it makes the system more transparent and enhances the human understanding of the system, which is a benefit per se. Furthermore, the fact that the system is transparent increases the trust of the user, which (apart from being one of the goals of AI in general) can increase the chance that the user is persuaded by the system. Finally, the user can give a feedback on the presented arguments (e.g. how much they believe the arguments are ethical), which can be later used to improve the persuasion system.

TI  - Noticed and appreciated? The role of argument diversity in enhancing news credibility and reader satisfaction
T2  - JOURNALISM
AB  - Although viewpoint diversity is a keyvalue for audiences, journalism and media policy, not much is known about how audiences process and evaluate it. This is critical because any positive effect we might expect from a broad range of views (e.g., on opinion formation) requires that recipients recognize and appreciate it as a part of news content. The current study examines how news readers process and evaluate argument diversity as a specific aspect of viewpoint diversity. In a 2 x 2 x 2 between-subject experiment, 1363 subjects were exposed to news reports containing a diverse or homogenous set of arguments in the context of two currently debated issues (artificial intelligence and immigration). Reports were either published by a single or multiple media outlets to determine potential differences between internal and external argument diversity. We find that readers not only recognize the presence of argument diversity, but that it leads to an increase in overall news satisfaction. This increase can be attributed to a higher credibility of news reports with diverse arguments.

TI  - Genetic algorithm for fuel spill identification
T2  - ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA
AB  - Gas chromatography is frequently used to fingerprint fuel spills, with the gas chromatograms of the spill sample and the different candidate fuels compared visually in order to seek a best match. However, visual analysis of gas chromatograms is subjective and is not always persuasive in a court of law. Pattern recognition methods offer a better approach to the problem of matching gas chromatograms of weathered fuels. Pattern recognition methods involve less subjectivity in the interpretation of the data and are capable of identifying fingerprint patterns within gas chromatographic (GC) data characteristic of fuel-type, even if the fuel samples comprising the training set have been subjected to a variety of conditions. In this paper, We report on the development of a genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern recognition analysis of GC fuel spill data. The pattern recognition GA incorporates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a "smart" one-pass procedure for feature selection. Its efficacy is demonstrated by way of two studies recently completed in our laboratory on fuel spill identification. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Consumers' persuasion knowledge of algorithms in social media advertising: identifying consumer groups based on awareness, appropriateness, and coping ability
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - Advertising and brand communication in social media are increasingly driven by algorithms. Theoretically rooted in the Persuasion Knowledge Model, we aim to identify and investigate the prevalence of specific consumer groups that differ in their awareness levels, critical evaluations, and abilities to cope with such algorithmic persuasion in social media, as well as to investigate the predictors of these groups. By performing an online survey among a Dutch sample (n = 450) and a two-step cluster analysis, we identified four groups: the Control Paradox (the largest group), Fatigued, Uninformed but Critical, and Skilled and Critical. The four groups differed in respect to gender, age, education level, internet skills, self-reported knowledge of algorithms, privacy concerns, and perceived personalization of branded social media messages. Theoretically, this paper contributes to our understanding of algorithmic persuasion by proposing a consumer typology and discussing implications for the Persuasion Knowledge Model. Practically, this study provides evidence-based recommendations for policymakers on how to empower different types of consumers.

TI  - Design, development, and evaluation of an mHealth app to reduce stress and promote happiness through smiling
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The field of mental health application research is growing, yet comprehensive, long-term studies validating claims of stress reduction and mood enhancement are limited, with many apps lacking empirical evidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an mHealth application called SmileApp to promote positive mood as a means of reducing stress. The design of SmileApp is grounded in psychological theories and integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and persuasive technology (PT). To evaluate SmileApp, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study involving 72 participants. This was followed by an optional semi-structured interview with 23 participants. Quantitative results suggest that SmileApp is usable, useful, and encourages users to smile more frequently. Furthermore, qualitative results suggest that SmileApp was a unique design to help users alleviate stress. These results offer valuable insights into innovative approaches for designing mHealth applications that promote positive mood. Moreover, the findings underscore the importance of utilising technology to support emotional well-being. We present a novel approach to promote desired behaviours by motivating users to read supportive messages and playing mobile games through the act of smiling.

TI  - Toward the Prevention of Privacy Threats: How Can We Persuade Our Social Network Platform Users?
T2  - HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES
AB  - Complex decision-making problems, such as the privacy policy selection, when sharing content in online social network (OSN) platforms can significantly benefit from artificial intelligence systems. With the use of computational argumentation, it is possible to persuade human users to modify their initial decisions to avoid potential privacy threats and violations. In this paper, we present a study performed with the participation of 186 teenage users aimed at analyzing their behaviors when we try to persuade them to modify the post/publication of sensitive content on OSN platforms with different arguments. The results of the study revealed that the personality traits and the social interaction data (e.g., number of comment posts, friends, and likes) of our participants were significantly correlated with the persuasive power of the arguments. Therefore, these sets of features can be used to model OSN users and estimate the persuasive power of different arguments when used in human-computer interactions. The findings presented in this paper are helpful for personalizing decision support systems aimed at educating and preventing privacy violations on OSN platforms using arguments.

TI  - Does it pay to be honest? The effect of retailer-provided negative feedback on consumers' product choice and shopping experience
T2  - JOURNAL OF BUSINESS RESEARCH
AB  - This research aims at investigating the potential double-edged sword effect of a retailer's negative feedback, which may not only lead consumers to alter their purchase decisions, but also provide a shopping experience that is more effortful and thus be of less utilitarian value. Three experiments were performed involving 678 participants. Overall, results suggest a double-edged sword effect of negative feedback in online and offline retail contexts. When compared to no feedback, neutral feedback, or positive feedback, negative feedback leads consumers to change their initial product choice whatever their choice uncertainty and whatever the feedback source (human advisor or algorithmic advisor). However, it also leads to the perception of more cognitive effort and reduced utilitarian value, resulting in lower purchase and word-of-mouth intentions. The only situation in which negative feedback does not degrade the utilitarian value of the shopping experience is when consumers are highly uncertain about their initial product choice.

TI  - A quantitative argumentation-based Automated eXplainable Decision System for fake news detection on social media
T2  - KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS
AB  - Social media is flooded with rumors, which make fake news detection a pressing problem. Many black box approaches have been proposed to automatically predict the veracity of claims. These methods are lack of interpretability. Thus, we propose a Quantitative Argumentation-based Automated eXplainable Decision-making System (QA-AXDS) to tackle this problem and provide users with explanations about the results. The system is fully data-driven in its processes, which allows our models to make greater use of data and be more automatic and scalable than other quantitative framework models. In terms of interpretability, the system can automatically acquire human-level knowledge, and interact with users in the form of dialog trees through explanatory models, thus helping them understand the internal reasoning process of the system. The experimental results show that our system has better transparency and interpretability than other approaches based on the pure machine learning methods, and performs competitively in accuracy among others. In addition, the explanation model provides a way to improve the algorithms when some problems are identified by checking the explanations. (C)& nbsp;2022 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Acceptability of Mobile App-Based Motivational Interviewing and Preferences for App Features to Support Self-Management in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: Qualitative Study
T2  - JMIR DIABETES
AB  - Background: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experience multiple barriers to improving self-management. Evidence suggests that motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered communication method, can address patient barriers and promote healthy behavior. Despite the value of MI, existing MI studies predominantly used face-to-face or phone-based interventions. With the growing adoption of smartphones, automated MI techniques powered by artificial intelligence on mobile devices may offer effective motivational support to patients with T2DM. Objective: This study aimed to explore the perspectives of patients with T2DM on the acceptability of app-based MI in routine health care and collect their feedback on specific MI module features to inform our future intervention. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with patients with T2DM, recruited from public primary care clinics. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo. Results: In total, 33 patients with T2DM participated in the study. Participants saw MI as a mental reminder to increase motivation and a complementary care model conducive to self-reflection and behavior change. Yet, there was a sense of reluctance, mainly stemming from potential compromise of autonomy in self-care by the introduction of MI. Some participants felt confident their ability to manage conditions independently, while others reported already making changes and preferred self-management at their own pace. Compared with in-person MI, app-based MI was viewed as offering a more relaxed atmosphere for open sharing without being judged by health care providers. However, participants questioned the lack of human touch, which could potentially undermine a patient-provider therapeutic relationship. To sustain motivation, participants suggested more features of an ongoing supportive nature such as the visualization of milestones, gamified challenges and incremental rewards according to achievements, tailored multimedia resources based on goals, and conversational tools that are interactive and empathic. Conclusions:Our findings suggest the need for a hybrid model of intervention involving both app-based automated MI and human coaching. Patient feedback on specific app features will be incorporated into the module development and tested in randomized controlled trial.

TI  - What the Metaverse Is (Really) and Why We Need to Know About It
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING
AB  - Major technology companies are investing significant sums of money in the creation of the metaverse whose main feature will be the fusion between the virtual world and the physical world. To allow this possibility is one of the less obvious features of the metaverse: the metaverse works like our minds. This ability makes the metaverse a significantly different technology from its predecessors. If television and social media are persuasive technologies, because of their ability to influence people's attitudes and behaviors, the metaverse is instead a transformative technology, capable of modifying what people think reality is. To achieve this goal, the technologies of the metaverse hack different key cognitive mechanisms: the experience of being in a place and in a body, the processes of brain-to-brain attunement and synchrony, and the ability of experiencing and inducing emotions. Clearly, these possibilities define totally new scenarios with positive and negative outcomes. Educating ourselves as to its promise, and the challenges it may present, is a necessity. This requires a "humane," integrated, and multidisciplinary approach, with stakeholders at the supranational level joining in the conversation.

TI  - Persuasion Meets AI: Ethical Considerations for the Design of Social Engineering Countermeasures
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 12TH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY, KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (KMIS), VOL 3
CP  - 12th International Joint Conference on Knowledge Discovery, Knowledge Engineering and Knowledge Management (IC3K) / 12th International Conference on Knowledge Management and Information Systems (KMIS)
AB  - Privacy in Social Network Sites (SNSs) like Facebook or Instagram is closely related to people's selfdisclosure decisions and their ability to foresee the consequences of sharing personal information with large and diverse audiences. Nonetheless, online privacy decisions are often based on spurious risk judgements that make people liable to reveal sensitive data to untrusted recipients and become victims of social engineering attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combination with persuasive mechanisms like nudging is a promising approach for promoting preventative privacy behaviour among the users of SNSs. Nevertheless, combining behavioural interventions with high levels of personalization can be a potential threat to people's agency and autonomy even when applied to the design of social engineering countermeasures. This paper elaborates on the ethical challenges that nudging mechanisms can introduce to the development of AI-based countermeasures, particularly to those addressing unsafe self-disclosure practices in SNSs. Overall, it endorses the elaboration of personalized risk awareness solutions as i) an ethical approach to counteract social engineering, and ii) as an effective means for promoting reflective privacy decisions.

TI  - Towards a Persuasive Recommender for Bike Sharing Systems: A Defeasible Argumentation Approach
T2  - ENERGIES
AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users' characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system.

TI  - The Post-advertising Condition. A Socio-Semiotic and Semio-Pragmatic Approach to Algorithmic Capitalism
T2  - SOCIAL COMPUTING AND SOCIAL MEDIA: COMMUNICATION AND SOCIAL COMMUNITIES, SCSM 2019, PT II
CP  - 11th International Conference on Social Computing and Social Media (SCSM) Held as Part of the 21st International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI International)
AB  - The primary hypothesis of this paper is that recent years have seen a shift from digital advertising to post-advertising: thanks to the growing role of machine learning algorithms in communicational processes, advertising has been losing the character of explicitly persuasive addresses to assume that of friendly and open proposals and advice, or even the simple facilitation of everyday purchasing practices. The paper seeks to understand if and under what conditions the socio-semiotic and semio-pragmatic approaches developed in relation to traditional advertising can still be applied to post-advertising phenomena. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first one, the advent of the post-advertising condition is considered. In the second one, Amazon's Alexa, an example of a post-advertising dispositive, is analyzed. In the third part, the question of the use of traditional semiotic concepts and methods for the analysis of post-advertising is examined. The final answer to this question is affirmative, but on the condition that some new conceptual and methodological tools be introduced.

TI  - Checking the Fact-Checkers: The Role of Source Type, Perceived Credibility, and Individual Differences in Fact-Checking Effectiveness
T2  - COMMUNICATION RESEARCH
AB  - This study investigates fact-checking effectiveness in reducing belief in misinformation across various types of fact-check sources (i.e., professional fact-checkers, mainstream news outlets, social media platforms, artificial intelligence, and crowdsourcing). We examine fact-checker credibility perceptions as a mechanism to explain variance in fact-checking effectiveness across sources, while taking individual differences into account (i.e., analytic thinking and alignment with the fact-check verdict). An experiment with 859 participants revealed few differences in effectiveness across fact-checking sources but found that sources perceived as more credible are more effective. Indeed, the data show that perceived credibility of fact-check sources mediates the relationship between exposure to fact-checking messages and their effectiveness for some source types. Moreover, fact-checker credibility moderates the effect of alignment on effectiveness, while analytic thinking is unrelated to fact-checker credibility perceptions, alignment, and effectiveness. Other theoretical contributions include extending the scope of the credibility-persuasion association and the MAIN model to the fact-checking context, and empirically verifying a critical component of the two-step motivated reasoning model of misinformation correction.

TI  - Living With Digital Government: Effects of Technology Anxiety on Public Support for Policy in China
T2  - JOURNAL OF CHINESE POLITICAL SCIENCE
AB  - Living with digital government is less of a technical issue but more of a political process. In political science, one new issue in need of greater theorizing and investigating is public anxiety about the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) by digital government which has become an emerging challenge for the country to obtain public support. Employing an online survey in China, we test whether technology anxiety influences public support for policy and examine the mechanisms within them, namely, political persuasion, interaction orientation, and people's happiness. Survey evidence reveals that technology anxiety exerts a significantly negative effect on public support, especially in flexible employment and service industry. Additionally, technology anxiety indirectly influences public support for policy through the three abovementioned mechanisms, with political persuasion based on algorithm demonstrating the most pronounced mediating role. The findings contribute to understanding the relationship between public anxiety and political support in Chinese context and beyond, and enrich the studies of political psychology and legitimacy.

TI  - Subjective-probability forecasts of existential risk: Initial results from a hybrid persuasion-forecasting tournament
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING
AB  - A multi-stage persuasion-forecasting tournament asked specialists and generalists ("superforecasters") to explain their probability judgments of short- and long-run existential threats to humanity. Specialists were more pessimistic, especially on long-run threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI). Despite incentives to share their best arguments during four months of discussion, neither side materially moved the other's views. This would be puzzling if participants were Bayesian agents methodically sifting through elusive clues about distant futures but it is less puzzling if participants were boundedly rational agents searching for confirmatory evidence as the risks of embarrassing accuracy feedback receded. Consistent with the latter mechanism, strong AI-risk proponents made particularly extreme longbut not short-range forecasts and over-estimated the longrange AI-risk forecasts of others. We stress the potential of these methods to inform high-stakes debates, but we acknowledge limits on what even skilled forecasters can achieve in anticipating rare or unprecedented events.

TI  - Using Distributional Models for Studying the Influence of School Textbooks in Children Bias
T2  - IEEE ACCESS
AB  - School textbooks have a profound influence on shaping the thoughts of young individuals. Reducing sex, gender, and race bias in these educational materials is then an imperative social goal. Despite efforts to address bias, historical and contemporary textbooks have been found to perpetuate stereotyped associations: efficient techniques like word embeddings can be used to analyze a wide range of school textbooks to assess the presence of stereotyped biases. In this paper, we use Artificial Intelligence to test what happens if people are exposed to some textbooks or others. Our procedure can be used for in-silico testing of the persuasive power of textbooks. For this purpose, we introduce ChildDM, a model constructed from a corpus of children's free-produced language, and its domain-adapted version, ChildDM-School, trained on a collection of school textbooks. Leveraging the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) framework, we investigate how biases evolve in the language of children after exposition to historical textbooks. While historical textbooks tend to avoid explicit gender-based stereotypes in the scientific and artistic domains, they still conceal biases. Specifically, women are associated with caregiving and family-related activities.

TI  - Promoting mindful consumption through a chatbot with an experiential mind
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER MARKETING
AB  - PurposeTo promote long-term sustainability and improve consumers' quality of life, marketers can use artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to initiate conversations about mindful consumption. Although anthropomorphic designs are integral for successful persuasion, there is scant research on how anthropomorphizing chatbots' internal traits influences consumers. Integrating the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE) and the Arousal-Biased Competition (ABC) theory, this study aims to investigate how a chatbot with a higher experiential mind shapes attitudes toward mindful consumption messages by examining people's emotional responses (i.e. eeriness and amazement) and cognitive engagement.Design/methodology/approachIncorporating real-time interactions with a chatbot, this research adopted an online experiment with a one-factor, two-condition (a higher vs a lower experiential mind) design with eeriness and amazement as parallel mediators, leading to cognitive absorption and, consequently, attitudes toward mindful consumption messages in a serial manner.FindingsThis study found that a chatbot with a higher (vs lower) experiential mind simultaneously triggers higher levels of eeriness and amazement, leading to higher cognitive absorption and a more positive message attitude.Originality/valueThis study expands the current anthropomorphism literature by examining the effects of imbuing nonhuman agents with an experiential mind and emphasizing a nuanced view of emotional responses to anthropomorphized chatbots. The findings contribute to establishing a theoretical link between a chatbot's experiential mind level and persuasion outcomes, offering strategic and ethical insights for anthropomorphized AI use in sustainability marketing.

TI  - A Novel Diagnostic Decision Support System for Medical Professionals: Prospective Feasibility Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Continuously growing medical knowledge and the increasing amount of data make it difficult for medical professionals to keep track of all new information and to place it in the context of existing information. A variety of digital technologies and artificial intelligence-based methods are currently available as persuasive tools to empower physicians in clinical decision-making and improve health care quality. A novel diagnostic decision support system (DDSS) prototype developed by Ada Health GmbH with a focus on traceability, transparency, and usability will be examined more closely in this study.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and functionality of a novel DDSS prototype, exploring its potential and performance in identifying the underlying cause of acute dyspnea in patients at the University Hospital Basel.
   Methods: A prospective, observational feasibility study was conducted at the emergency department (ED) and internal medicine ward of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. A convenience sample of 20 adult patients admitted to the ED with dyspnea as the chief complaint and a high probability of inpatient admission was selected. A study physician followed the patients admitted to the ED throughout the hospitalization without interfering with the routine clinical work. Routinely collected health-related personal data from these patients were entered into the DDSS prototype. The DDSS prototype's resulting disease probability list was compared with the gold-standard main diagnosis provided by the treating physician.
   Results: The DDSS presented information with high clarity and had a user-friendly, novel, and transparent interface. The DDSS prototype was not perfectly suited for the ED as case entry was time-consuming (1.5-2 hours per case). It provided accurate decision support in the clinical inpatient setting (average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was the first diagnosis listed: 6/20, 30%, SD 2.10%; average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was listed as one of the top 3: 11/20, 55%, SD 2.39%; average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was listed as one of the top 5: 14/20, 70%, SD 2.26%) in patients with dyspnea as the main presenting complaint.
   Conclusions: The study of the feasibility and functionality of the tool was successful, with some limitations. Used in the right place, the DDSS has the potential to support physicians in their decision-making process by showing new pathways and unintentionally ignored diagnoses. The DDSS prototype had some limitations regarding the process of data input, diagnostic accuracy, and completeness of the integrated medical knowledge. The results of this study provide a basis for the tool's further development. In addition, future studies should be conducted with the aim to overcome the current limitations of the tool and study design.

TI  - Do chatbots establish "humanness" in the customer purchase journey? An investigation through explanatory sequential design
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB  - Chatbots incorporate various behavioral and psychological marketing elements to satisfy customers at various stages of their purchase journey. This research follows the foundations of the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and examines how cognitive and peripheral cues impact experiential dimensions, leading to chatbot user recommendation intentions. The study introduced warmth and competence as mediating variables in both the purchase and postpurchase stages, utilizing a robust explanatory sequential mixed-method research design. The researchers tested and validated the proposed conceptual model using a 3 x 3 factorial design, collecting 354 responses in the purchase stage and 286 responses in the postpurchase stage. In the second stage, they conducted in-depth qualitative interviews (Study 2) to gain further insights into the validity of the experimental research (Study 1). The results obtained from Study 1 revealed that "cognitive cues" and "competence" significantly influence recommendation intentions among chatbot users. On the other hand, "peripheral cues" and warmth significantly contribute to positive experiences encountered during the purchase stage. The researchers further identified 69 thematic codes through exploratory research, providing a deeper understanding of the variables. Theoretically, this study extends the ELM by introducing new dimensions to human-machine interactions at the heart of digital transformation. From a managerial standpoint, the study emphasizes the significance of adding a "humanness" element in chatbot development to create more engaging and positive customer experiences actively.

TI  - Communicating the benefits and risks of AI technology in hiring: implications for organization-public relationships
T2  - CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONS
AB  - PurposeAs artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations have begun to adopt AI in hiring. Despite the increasing use of AI in hiring, little is known about how organizations can effectively communicate with their stakeholders about their AI use. Using gain and loss message frames and organization-public relationships (OPRs) as theoretical frameworks, this study tests the impact of exposure to job advertisements that address AI use on individuals' attitudes and behaviors toward organizations using AI during hiring.Design/methodology/approachWe conducted a 2 (message frames: gain vs loss) x 2 (benefits of using AI in hiring: faster hiring process vs reduced unconscious hiring bias) between-subjects experiment using a Prolific online panel (N = 224). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions and viewed a fictitious company's job advertisement that varied in message frames and benefits of using AI. After viewing the experimental stimuli, participants answered questions about OPRs, attitudes toward the company and positive word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions.FindingsLoss-framed messages appeared as more effective in increasing OPRs, favorable attitudes toward the company and positive WOM intentions. OPRs positively mediated the impact of exposure to loss-framed job advertisements on attitudes and positive WOM intentions. The benefits of using AI in hiring moderated the impact of loss-framed messages on OPRs, attitudes and positive WOM intentions.Practical implicationsThis study offers important practical implications for organizations that use AI technology in their hiring practices or are interested in incorporating AI into their hiring processes. The significant impact of loss-framed messages suggests that organizations should highlight the anticipated negative outcomes of not using AI rather than addressing the positive outcomes from AI use. The findings align with established negativity bias research in framing literature, demonstrating individuals' greater susceptibility to negative information and adverse outcomes in persuasive contexts. The moderating effect of the benefits of using AI in hiring indicates that the impact of message frames on individuals' attitudinal and behavioral responses to organizations' AI use varies depending on organizations' rationale for using AI.Originality/valueThis study is one of the early studies to examine individuals' attitudinal and behavioral responses to organizations' use of AI in hiring. Prior research suggests that OPRs mediate the relationship between individuals' exposure to organizational messages and their attitudes toward organizations. Extending this line of inquiry, the current study explores OPRs' mediating role in the context of AI-driven hiring processes and investigates how OPRs mediate the relationships between organizations' message framing strategies and individuals' attitudes toward the organization as well as their WOM intentions. By examining the effectiveness of gain- and loss-framed job advertisements, this study offers important insights for organizations on how to more effectively and ethically communicate about AI use with their stakeholders.

TI  - Monetization of customer futures through machine learning and artificial intelligence based persuasive technologies
T2  - JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY POLICY MANAGEMENT
AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study was to ascertain how real options investment perspective could be applied towards monetization of customer futures through the deployment of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based persuasive technologies. Design/methodology/approach The authors embarked on a theoretical treatise as advocated by scholars (Cornelissen, 2019; Barney, 2018; Cornelissen, 2017; Smithey Fulmer, 2012; Bacharach, 1989; Whetten, 1989; Weick,1989). Towards this end, theoretical argumentative logic was incrementally used to build an integrated perspective on the deployment of learning and AI-based persuasive technologies. This was carried out with strategic real options investment perspective to secure customer futures on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Findings M-commerce apps and e-commerce sites have been deploying ML and AI-based tools (referred to as persuasive technologies), to nudge customers for increased and quicker purchase. The primary objective was to increase engagement time of customers (at an individual level), grow the number of customers (at market level) and increase firm revenue (at an organizational level). The deployment of any persuasive technology entailed increased investment (cash outflow) but was also expected to increase the level of revenue and margin (cash inflow). Given the dynamics of market and the emergent nature of persuasive technologies, ascertaining favourable cash flow was challenging. Real options strategy provided a robust theoretical perspective to time the persuasive technology-related investment in stages. This helped managers to be on time with loading customer purchase with increased temporal immediacy. A real options investment space involving six spaces has also been developed in this conceptual work. These were Never Invest, Immediately Investment, Present-day Investment Possibility, Possibly Invest Later, Invest Probably Later and Possibly Never Invest. Research limitations/implications The foundations of this study domain encompassed work done by an eclectic mix of scholars like from technology management (Siggelkow and Terwiesch, 2019a; Porter and Heppelmann, 2014), real options (Trigeorgis and Reuer, 2017; Luehrman, 1998a, 1998b), marketing intelligence and planning (Appel et al., 2020; Thaichon et al., 2019; Thaichon et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2019) and strategy from a demand positioning school of thought (Adner and Zemsky, 2006). Practical implications The findings would help managers to comprehend what level of investments need to be done in a staggered manner. The phased way of investing towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies would enable better monetization of customer futures. This would aid marketing managers for increased customer engagement at the individual level, fast monetization of customer futures and increased number of customers and consumption on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Originality/value This was one of the first studies to apply real options investment perspective towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies for monetizing customer futures.

TI  - Unveiling the Power of Argument Arrangement in Online Persuasive Discussions
T2  - FINDINGS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (EMNLP 2023)
CP  - Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)
AB  - Previous research on argumentation in online discussions has largely focused on examining individual comments and neglected the interactive nature of discussions. In line with previous work, we represent individual comments as sequences of semantic argumentative unit types. However, because it is intuitively necessary for dialogical argumentation to address the opposing viewpoints, we extend this model by clustering type sequences into different argument arrangement patterns and representing discussions as sequences of these patterns. These sequences of patterns are a symbolic representation of argumentation strategies that capture the overall structure of discussions. Using this novel approach, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the strategies in 34,393 discussions from the online discussion forum Change My View and show that our discussion model is effective for persuasiveness prediction, outperforming LLM-based classifiers on the same data. Our results provide valuable insights into argumentation dynamics in online discussions and, through the presented prediction procedure, are of practical importance for writing assistance and persuasive text generation systems.

TI  - ICT-Based Learning Solutions for Children with ASD: A Requirement Engineering Study
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPECIAL EDUCATION
AB  - This research explores the explicit requirements to design and develop ICT-based learning solutions for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A requirement elicitation study has been conducted for six weeks of the study's in Pune, India. The study sample size is fifteen (N=15), with an age limit be-tween five to twelve years old. All the participants have been diagnosed with ASD and undergoing a skills development process in the same institution for at least six months. The outcomes of this research are tri-fold. Firstly, identify the twelve explicit requirements to design and develop ICT-based learning solutions considering the challenges due to autism. Secondly, conformity to the existing Multi Agent based Persuasive Education (MAPE) model with revealed requirements. Thirdly, propose an Internet of Things (IoT) based framework to observe and record the learning performance of ASD-affected children. The unique contribution of this study is to develop a Level-5 IoT framework to incorporate the requirements revealed through the participa-tory design approach for implementing ICT-based learning solutions. The proposed framework forms the basis for developing a dataset to identify the learning patterns and new requirements for ASD-affected children through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).

TI  - Explanations Considered Harmful: The Impact of Misleading Explanations on Accuracy in Hybrid Human-AI Decision Making
T2  - EXPLAINABLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, XAI 2024, PT IV
CP  - 2nd World Conference on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (xAI)
AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) has the potential to enhance decision-making in human-AI collaborations, yet existing research indicates that explanations can also lead to undue reliance on AI recommendations, a dilemma often referred to as the 'white box paradox.' This paradox illustrates how persuasive explanations for incorrect advice might foster inappropriate trust in AI systems. Our study extends beyond the traditional scope of the white box paradox by proposing a framework for examining explanation inadequacy. We specifically investigate how accurate AI advice, when paired with misleading explanations, affects decision-making in logic puzzle tasks. Our findings introduce the concept of the 'XAI halo effect,' where participants were influenced by the misleading explanations to the extent that they did not verify the correctness of the advice, despite its accuracy. This effect reveals a nuanced challenge in XAI, where even correct advice can lead to misjudgment if the accompanying explanations are not coherent and contextually relevant. The study highlights the critical need for explanations to be both accurate and relevant, especially in contexts where decision accuracy is paramount. This calls into question the use of explanations in situations where their potential to mislead outweighs their transparency or educational value.

TI  - Predicting online participation and adoption of autism unproven interventions: a case study of dietary interventions
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Family caregivers of autistic children are susceptible to unconfirmed fads and false claims regarding to the efficacy of unproven interventions. This study aims to predict family caregivers' participation and adoption of unproven interventions in online communities. Based on the Diffusion of Innovations theory, we first divided the family caregivers' adoption process into five stages: awareness, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Social network analysis and natural language processing methods were subsequently utilised to characterise personal, environmental, and behavioural factors for predicting the formation of last three stage. The results indicated promising evidence for the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting family caregivers' decision (AUC = 0.823), implementation (AUC = 0.887), and confirmation (AUC = 0.921). Furthermore, the results showed that factors such as social interaction, social persuasion, and modelling significantly contributed to family caregivers' online community participation and facilitated the adoption process of unproven interventions. Family caregivers with stronger negative emotions expressed were more likely to adopt unproven interventions and recommend these interventions to other community members, thereby accelerating the diffusion of these interventions.

TI  - Learning analytics for lifelong career development: a framework to support sustainable formative assessment and self-reflection in programs developing career self-efficacy
T2  - FRONTIERS IN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Among myriad complex challenges facing educational institutions in this era of a rapidly evolving job marketplace is the development of career self-efficacy among students. Self-efficacy has traditionally been understood to be developed through the direct experience of competence, the vicarious experience of competence, social persuasion, and physiological cues. These four factors, and particularly the first two, are difficult to build into education and training programs in a context where changing skills make the specific meaning of graduate competence largely unknown and, notwithstanding the other contributions in this collection, largely unknowable. In response, in this paper we argue for a working metacognitive model of career self-efficacy that will prepare students with the skills needed to evaluate their skills, attitudes and values and then adapt and develop them as their career context evolves around them. The model we will present is one of evolving complex sub-systems within an emergent milieu. In identifying various contributing factors, the model provides specific cognitive and affective constructs as important targets for actionable learning analytics for career development.

TI  - Unisa at SemEval-2023 Task 3: A SHAP-based method for Propaganda Detection
T2  - 17TH INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP ON SEMANTIC EVALUATION, SEMEVAL-2023
CP  - 17th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation (SemEval)
AB  - This paper presents proposed solutions for addressing two subtasks in SemEval-2023 Task 3: "Detecting the Genre, the Framing, and the Persuasion techniques in online news in a multilingual setup". In subtask 1, "News Genre Categorisation", the goal is to classify a news article as an opinion, a report, or a satire. In subtask 3, "Detection of Persuasion Technique", the system must reveal persuasion techniques used in each news article paragraph choosing among 23 defined methods.
   Solutions leverage the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). In subtask 1, SHAP was used to understand what was driving the model to fail so that it could be improved accordingly. In contrast, in subtask 3, a re-calibration of the Attention Mechanism was realized by extracting critical tokens for each persuasion technique. The underlying idea is the exploitation of XAI for countering the overfitting of the resulting model and attempting to improve the performance when there are few samples in the training data. The achieved performance on English for subtask 1 ranked 6th with an F1-score of 58.6% (despite 78.4% of the 1st) and for subtask 3 ranked 12th with a micro-averaged F1-score of 29.8% (despite 37.6% of the 1st).

TI  - Exploring the phenomenon and ethical issues of AI paternalism in health apps
T2  - BIOETHICS
AB  - Health apps, including consumer-oriented fitness apps, have two functions. They are supposed to monitor and promote users' health, the latter by way of being an instance of persuasive technology. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for AI health apps, i.e., health apps that act more and more autonomously when it comes to analyzing users' health data and arriving at tailor-made results on how to improve their health. Consequently, AI health apps seem to gain a paternalistic potential. This is a game-changer, for corresponding issues of paternalism can then no longer be traced back to human engineers. Instead, the paternalizing party just is the AI system. Hence, AI health apps lead to the novel issue of AI paternalism in health care. In this paper, I explore this novel phenomenon and its ethical implications. Firstly, I discuss from a critical perspective whether the notion of AI paternalism makes (conceptual) sense to begin with. Unsurprisingly, I argue that it does and how so. Secondly, I briefly indicate important ethical issues that AI paternalism in health apps raise and which need to be discussed in more detail in order to judge under which conditions (certain forms of) AI paternalism might be considered acceptable, if at all.

TI  - Mirror, mirror on the screen, "Wherein can I find me?" - On the sublime qualities of AI recommendation systems, algorithm conformity, and the else
T2  - ORGANIZATION
AB  - Algorithmic persuasion is a mode of organizing that happens through inducing experiences that covertly seek to influence behavior by presenting an ongoing stream of affective recommendations. This essay advances the thesis that this mode of algorithmic organizing has the capacity to affect individuals' sense of their self and explores how and why this may happen. It suggests that individuals may be susceptible to experiencing AI recommendation systems as sublime. Their sublime qualities give normative force to their recommendations and, through them, appeal to one's affective drives, fears, and hopes, revealing who or what one is or may become. This subjecting of one's self to these recommendations warrants two critical observations: a behavioral preference we call "people-like-you" and the emergence of "algorithm conformity" as an organizing force. Yet, there can be epistemic corruption in the recommendations. This epistemic corruption is the else, whose experience can evoke uncanny feelings and carries with it the possibility to break the spell of the sublime and to escape and resist algorithm conformity. But can such experiences, individual and dispersed, give rise to actions of collective resistance in a world of algorithmic capitalism?

TI  - Authentically Fake? How Consumers Respond to the Influence of Virtual Influencers
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - Artificially created characters - virtual influencers - amass millions of followers on social media and affect digital natives' engagement and decisionmaking in remarkable ways. Guided by the Uses and Gratification (U&G) approach and the Uncanny Valley Theory, this study seeks to understand this phenomenon. By looking into followers' engagement with virtual influencers, this study identifies and conceptualizes six primary motivations - namely, novelty, information, entertainment, surveillance, esthetics, and integration and social interaction. Furthermore, we found that most followers perceive virtual influencers as uncanny and authentically fake. However, followers also express acceptance of their staged fabrication where curated flaws and self-justification have been found to mitigate the effect of the uncanny valley. Virtual influencers are considered effective in building brand image and boosting brand awareness, but lack the persuasive ability to incite purchase intention due to a lack of authenticity, a low similarity to followers, and their weak parasocial relations with followers. These findings advance the extant literature on U&G, influencer advertising, and virtual influencers in the era of artificial intelligence; provide insights into the mitigating factors of the uncanny valley; and yield theoretical and practical implications for the efficacy of virtual influencers in advertising campaigns.

TI  - Audio Mining: The Role of Vocal Tone in Persuasion
T2  - JOURNAL OF CONSUMER RESEARCH
AB  - Persuasion success is often related to hard-to-measure characteristics, such as the way the persuader speaks. To examine how vocal tones impact persuasion in an online appeal, this research measures persuaders' vocal tones in Kickstarter video pitches using novel audio mining technology. Connecting vocal tone dimensions with real-world funding outcomes offers insight into the impact of vocal tones on receivers' actions. The core hypothesis of this paper is that a successful persuasion attempt is associated with vocal tones denoting (1) focus, (2) low stress, and (3) stable emotions. These three vocal tone dimensions-which are in line with the stereotype content model-matter because they allow receivers to make inferences about a persuader's competence. The hypotheses are tested with a large-scale empirical study using Kickstarter data, which is then replicated in a different category. In addition, two controlled experiments provide evidence that perceptions of competence mediate the impact of the three vocal tones on persuasion attempt success. The results identify key indicators of persuasion attempt success and suggest a greater role for audio mining in academic consumer research.

T2  - 6TH WORLD MULTICONFERENCE ON SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS, VOL XIII, PROCEEDINGS: CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS OF SYSTEMICS, CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS III
CP  - 6th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics (SCI 2002)/8th International Conference on Information Systems Analysis and Synthesis (ISAS 2002)
AB  - In spite of the variety of the given Artificial intelligence definitions, those definitions remain all rights on the fact that the purpose of A.I, is to translate the intelligent human behaviour to the computer. This do necessary, the modelling of the said intelligent human behaviour. However, the modelling task is not at all evident one. When the considered application is related to the human intuition (i.e acquiring and use knowledge), the modelling process move away from formal, and depends essentially on the expert perception of the human comportment to be modelled. Note that the expert perception mights be incomplete, and depends on research results given on each domain related to the human cognition. In spite of that, results given by some models conceived and applied in A.I domain, gave an encouraging results. Most persuasive example can be the neural networks. In this paper, we will present a simple model oriented to knowledge acquiring and use, we mean by use, the task commonly called "deduction". We based our model on some underlined human cognition behaviours. The main remarkable characteristics of that model can be the high level of abstraction of the model, the flexibility to adjunction, suppression and substitution, the graphical simple representation, and the tolerance to errors which can occur during knowledge acquisition.

TI  - The design, implementation and pilot application of an intelligent online proctoring system for online exams
T2  - INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SMART EDUCATION
AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to design and implement an intelligent online proctoring system (IOPS) by using the advantage of artificial intelligence technology in order to monitor the online exam, which is urgently needed in online learning settings worldwide. As a pilot application, the authors used this system in an authentic university online exam and checked the proctoring result.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The IOPS adopts the B/S (Browser/Server) architecture. The server side is implemented with programming language C and Python and stores the identification data of all examinees and their important behavior change status, including facial expression, eye and mouth movement and speech. The browser side collects and analyzes multimodal data of the examinee writing the online test locally and transfers the examinee's most important behavior status change data to the server. Real-time face recognition and voice detection are implemented with the support of open-source software.
   Findings
   The system was integrated into a Web-based intelligent tutoring system for school mathematics education. As a pilot application, the system was also used for online proctored exam in an undergraduate seminar in Peking University during the epidemic period in 2020. The recorded log data show that all students concentrated themselves on the exam and did not leave the camera and did not speak.
   Originality/value
   During the epidemic period of the novel coronavirus outbreak, almost all educational institutions in the world use online learning as the best way to maintain the teaching and learning schedule for all students. However, current online instruction platforms lack the function to prevent the learners from cheating in online exams and cannot guarantee the integrity and equality for all examinees as in traditional classroom exams. The literature review shows that the online proctoring system should become an important component of online exams to tackle the growing online cheating problem. Although such proctoring systems have been developed and put on the market, the practical usage of such systems in authentic exams and its effect have not been reported. Those systems are heavyweight and commercial product and cannot be freely used in education. The light-weight IOPS developed by the authors could meet the need for online exam as a stable and practical approach and could contribute to the growing online learning and distance learning.

TI  - Don't Forget the Humble Text Message: 25 Years of Text Messaging in Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Since the early studies exploring the use of SMS text messaging for health intervention, text messaging has played a pivotal role in the advancement of mobile health. As an intervention modality, text messaging has provided vital learnings for the design and delivery of interventions, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite the advances in technology over the last 25 years, text messaging is still being used in largely the same way to deliver health information, behavior change interventions, and support. The strong, consistent evidence for the benefits of this type of intervention has made text messaging a routine part of health interventions around the world. Key to its success is its simplicity, alongside the benefit of being arguably the most accessible form of consumer digital health intervention. Text message interventions are well suited for public health interventions due to their low cost, vast reach, frequent use, high read rates, and ability to be tailored and personalized. Furthermore, the nature of text messaging interventions makes them ideal for the delivery of multilingual, culturally tailored interventions, which is important in the context of increasing cultural diversity in many countries internationally. Indeed, studies assessing text message-based health interventions have shown them to be effective across sociodemographic and ethnic groups and have led to their adoption into national-level health promotion programs. With a growing focus on artificial intelligence, robotics, sensors, and other advances in digital health, there is an opportunity to integrate these technologies into text messaging programs. Simultaneously, it is essential that equity remains at the forefront for digital health researchers, developers, and implementers. Ensuring digital health solutions address inequities in health experienced across the world while taking action to maximize digital inclusion will ensure the true potential of digital health is realized. Text messaging has the potential to continue to play a pivotal role in the delivery of equitable digital health tools to communities around the world for many years to come. Further new technologies can build on the humble text message, leveraging its success to advance the field of digital health. This Viewpoint presents a retrospective of text messaging in health, drawing on the example of text message-based interventions for smoking cessation, and presents evidence for the continued relevance of this mobile health modality in 2025 and beyond.

T2  - 2024 IEEE VIS WORKSHOP ON DATA STORYTELLING IN AN ERA OF GENERATIVE AI, GEN4DS
CP  - 2024 IEEE VIS Workshop on Data Storytelling in an Era of Generative AI
AB  - Data-driven storytelling serves as a crucial bridge for communicating ideas in a persuasive way. However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. We identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, we explore the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. We believe that leveraging constraints will facilitate both artistic and scientific aspects of data story generation.

TI  - When E-Commerce Personalization Systems Show and Tell: Investigating the Relative Persuasive Appeal of Content-Based versus Collaborative Filtering
T2  - JOURNAL OF ADVERTISING
AB  - In the e-commerce context, are we persuaded more by a product recommendation that matches our preferences (content filtering) or by one that is endorsed by others like us (collaborative filtering)? We addressed this question by conceptualizing these two filtering types as cues that trigger cognitive heuristics (mental shortcuts), following the heuristic-systematic model in social psychology. In addition, we investigated whether the degree to which the recommendation matches user preferences (or other users' endorsements) provides an argument for systematic processing, especially for those who need deeper insights into the accuracy of the algorithm, particularly in product categories where quality is subjective. Data from a 2 (algorithm type: content vs. collaborative filtering) x 3 (percentage match: low vs. medium vs. high) x 2 (product category: search vs. experience) + 2 (control: search and experience) between-subjects experiment (N = 469) reveal that for experience products, consumers prefer content-based filtering with higher percentage matches, because it is perceived as offering more transparency. This is especially true for individuals with high need for cognition. For search products, however, collaborative filtering leads to more positive evaluations by triggering the "bandwagon effect." These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence in strategic communications and design of algorithms for e-commerce recommender systems.

TI  - A Smart Ad Display System
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB  - This paper proposes a smart ad display system to provide personalized delivery of video ads. The proposed system records consumers' facial expression and eye gaze stream data as they watch an ad and analyzes data at the frame level. The recognized facial expression and detected eye gaze are matched to the corresponding frame of the video ad, thereby linking facial expressions to specific visual objects appearing in the ad. By tracking a consumer's facial expressions in response to various visual objects in real time, the system learns the consumer's individual preferences toward different ads, searches the ad pool, and selects and subsequently displays a new ad that is most likely to elicit positive attitudinal and behavioral responses. We demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system with two empirical studies. The results show that by tracking a consumer's facial responses to only one ad or even part of an ad, our proposed system is able to make reasonably accurate inferences about a consumer's ad preferences, with or without using information about other consumers. These inferences are used to make personalized recommendations that help enhance consumers' ad viewing experiences and elicit favorable responses.

TI  - Chatbot symbolic recovery and customer forgiveness: a moderated mediation model
T2  - JOURNAL OF HOSPITALITY AND TOURISM TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Purpose - Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are frequently used to handle customer complaints in the hospitality and tourism sectors; however, little is known about their recovery strategies. Further, the widespread usage of chatbots is anticipated to affect customers' favorable responses. Therefore, this study aims to examine how chatbots' symbolic recovery influences customer forgiveness through customer empathy and explore the moderating effect of time pressure on it. Moreover, it investigates the effect of customer forgiveness on customer reconciliation and customer continuous trust.
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data collected from 994 customers who have experienced chatbot recovery in tourism and hospitality during the past four months.
   Findings - The results show that chatbots' symbolic recovery stimulates customer forgiveness, which subsequently positively affects customer reconciliation and customer continuous trust. Moreover, customer empathy partially mediates the effect of chatbots' symbolic recovery on customer forgiveness, and time pressure plays a moderating role in the relationship between chatbots' symbolic recovery and customer forgiveness.
   Practical implications - The results offer highly persuasive insights that may be used to promote chatbots' symbolic recovery in tourism organizations. The effectiveness of chatbots' symbolic recovery in achieving customer forgiveness will motivate tourism organizations to use chatbots efficiently in service recovery.
   Originality/value - This study extends the theoretical scope of chatbot research by investigating the symbolic recovery capabilities of chatbots. Moreover, it expands the application of SOR theory in the context of chatbot service recovery and reveals the underlying mechanism behind the impact of chatbots' symbolic recovery on customer forgiveness, thus building and testing an integrative model of chatbot service recovery.

TI  - Will There Be a Neurolaw Revolution?
T2  - INDIANA LAW JOURNAL
AB  - The central debate in the field of neurolaw has focused on two claims. Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen argue that we do not have free will and that advances in neuroscience will eventually lead us to stop blaming people for their actions. Stephen Morse, by contrast, argues that we have free will and that the kind of advances Greene and Cohen envision will not and should not affect the law. I argue that neither side has persuasively made the case for or against a revolution in the way the law treats responsibility.
   There will, however, be a neurolaw revolution of a different sort. It will not necessarily arise from radical changes in our beliefs about criminal responsibility but from a wave of new brain technologies that will change society and the law in many ways, three of which I describe here: First, as new methods of brain imaging improve our ability to measure distress, the law will ease limitations on recoveries for emotional injuries. Second, as neuroirrzaging gives us better methods of inferring people's thoughts, we will have more laws to protect thought privacy but less actual thought privacy. Finally, improvements in artificial intelligence will systematically change how law is written and interpreted.

T2  - 2015 IEEE 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON TOOLS WITH ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (ICTAI 2015)
CP  - 27th IEEE International Conference on Tools with Artificial Intelligence (ICTAI)
AB  - Nowadays, argumentation is a salient keyword in artificial intelligence. The use of argumentation techniques is particularly convenient for thematics such that multiagent systems, where it allows to describe dialog protocols (using persuasion, negotiation,...) or on-line discussion analysis; it also allows to handle queries where a single agent has to reason with conflicting information (inference in the presence of inconsistency, inconsistency measure). This very rich framework gives numerous reasoning tools, thanks to several acceptability semantics and inference policies.
   On the other hand, the progress of SAT solvers in the recent years, and more generally the progress on Constraint Programming paradigms, lead to some powerful approaches that permit to tackle theoretically hard problems.
   The needs of efficient applications to solve the usual reasoning tasks in argumentation, together with the capabilities of modern Constraint Programming solvers, lead us to study the encoding of usual acceptability semantics into logical settings. We propose diverse use of Constraint Programming techniques to develop a software library dedicated to argumentative reasoning. We present a library which offers the advantages to be generic and easily adaptable. We finally describe an experimental study of our approach for a set of semantics and inference tasks, and we describe the behaviour of our solver during the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation.

TI  - Hidden Persuaders: LLMs' Political Leaning and Their Influence on Voters
T2  - 2024 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, EMNLP 2024
CP  - 29th Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing
AB  - Do LLMs have political leanings and are LLMs able to shift our political views? This paper explores these questions in the context of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Through a voting simulation, we demonstrate 18 open-weight and closed-source LLMs' political preference for Biden over Trump. We show how Biden-leaning becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned and reinforced models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to political questions related to the two nominees. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by recruiting 935 U.S. registered voters. Participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. Intriguingly, although LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support Biden, about 20% of Trump supporters reduced their support for Trump after LLM interaction. This result is noteworthy given that many studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further interaction with LLMs on political subjects. Further research on how LLMs affect users' political views is required, as their use becomes more widespread.

TI  - Design and Baseline Evaluation of Social Media Vaping Prevention Trial: Randomized Controlled Trial Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is a major public health problem and young adults aged 18-24 years are at high risk. Furthermore, oral nicotine products (ONPs) are growing in popularity in this population. Poly-use is widespread. New methodologies for rigorous online studies using social media have been conducted and shown to reduce nicotine use. Objective: We report on the design and baseline evaluation of a large-scale social media-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of antivaping social media on young adult vaping and determinants of use. Methods: Using the Virtual Lab social media platform, participants were recruited using an artificial intelligence chatbot and social media advertising, completed a baseline survey, and were randomized to 1 of 4 study arms. The design was to achieve specific numbers of impressions per arm over 3 survey time points. We recruited 8437 participants, stratified by vaper (n=5026) and nonvaper (n=3321) status. Questionnaire data were collected using the Qualtrics survey platform. Future analyses will examine the effects of social media content on vaping at the endline. Our data analysis describes the 2 cohort samples, examines balance across the 4 study arms on baseline variables in each of the cohorts, and evaluates the internal consistency of several multi-indicator measures of psychosocial constructs. Results: Among vapers, almost three-fourths were current vapers, >40% were current smokers (using in the past 30 days), and >48% were current poly-users (using e-cigarettes and >= 1 other tobacco products). Substantial numbers of current vapers also currently use some other product, including cigars (n=1520, 30.2%), hookah (n=794, 15.8%), smokeless devices (n=462, 9.2%), and ONPs (n=578, 11.5%). The average age of participants was 21.2 (SD 2) years. Just less than 45% of participants were non-Hispanic White (n=3728, 44.7%), just less than 47% (n=3913, 46.9%) of the sample was male, more than 44% (n=3704, 44.4%) reported completing high school, and 79.3% reported meeting basic needs or better. There were no significant differences between arms and strata by any of these demographics. We calculated scale scores for depression and covariates related to nicotine use and found high alphas. Finally, participants who reported having seen antitobacco brand advertising were more likely to have higher levels of these variables and scales than participants who reported not having seen the advertisements. These results will be examined in future studies. Conclusions:Social media can be used as a platform at scalefor longitudinal randomized controlled trials over extended periods, which extends previous research on short-term trials. Interventions delivered by social media can be used with large samples to evaluate social media health behavior change interventions. Future studies based on this research will evaluate the intervention and dose-response effects of social media exposure on vaping behavior and determinants.

TI  - Unveiling Emotional Intensity in Online Reviews: Adopting Advanced Machine Learning Techniques
T2  - AUSTRALASIAN MARKETING JOURNAL
AB  - The digital revolution has spurred significant growth in online reviews and user-generated content. Traditional methods used in Marketing for analysing large datasets have limitations, emphasising the need for improved analytical approaches, particularly with the advent of artificial intelligence technology. This research used a state-of-the-art transformer model to analyse extensive online book reviews to accurately identify six specific emotions in the reviews of both fiction (hedonic) and nonfiction (utilitarian) genres. This study collected 3,157,703 reviews of 15,293 books voted 'best book of the year' on GoodReads.com over the past decade. Our findings reveal noticeable differences in emotional intensity across genres, with nonfiction displaying a slightly higher level of joy, and fiction showing higher levels of anger, sadness and surprise. Joy emerged as the dominant emotion across genres; however, it does not necessarily have a direct impact on book ratings. This study emphasises the intricacies of reader emotions, serving as a significant case study for marketers and publishers aiming to optimise their strategies in the contemporary literary market. The study contributes to the literature on the impact of consumers' emotional responses, how they are reflected in social review commentary for high-involvement online products, and their impact on product ratings.

TI  - Algorithmic transparency and interpretability measures improve radiologists' performance in BI-RADS 4 classification
T2  - EUROPEAN RADIOLOGY
AB  - Objective To evaluate the perception of different types of AI-based assistance and the interaction of radiologists with the algorithm's predictions and certainty measures. Methods In this retrospective observer study, four radiologists were asked to classify Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System 4 (BI-RADS4) lesions (n = 101 benign, n = 99 malignant). The effect of different types of AI-based assistance (occlusion-based interpretability map, classification, and certainty) on the radiologists' performance (sensitivity, specificity, questionnaire) were measured. The influence of the Big Five personality traits was analyzed using the Pearson correlation. Results Diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved by AI-based assistance (an increase of 2.8% +/- 2.3%, 95 %-CI 1.5 to 4.0 %, p = 0.045) and trust in the algorithm was generated primarily by the certainty of the prediction (100% of participants). Different human-AI interactions were observed ranging from nearly no interaction to humanization of the algorithm. High scores in neuroticism were correlated with higher persuasibility (Pearson's r = 0.98, p = 0.02), while higher consciousness and change of accuracy showed an inverse correlation (Pearson's r = -0.96, p = 0.04). Conclusion Trust in the algorithm's performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the predictions in combination with a plausible heatmap. Human-AI interaction varied widely and was influenced by personality traits.

TI  - The Internet of No Things: Making the Internet Disappear and "See the Invisible"
T2  - IEEE COMMUNICATIONS MAGAZINE
AB  - Future emerging communication technologies are anticipated to fold into our surroundings, helping us get our noses off the smartphone screens and back into our environments. In doing so, they make us more (rather than less) present in the world around us. While 5G was supposed to be about the Internet of Everything, to be transformative 6G might be just about the opposite of Everything, that is, Nothing or, more technically, No Things. Building on the invisible-to-visible technology concept, this article explores how the full potential of multisensory extended reality (XR) experiences may be unleashed in Multiverse cross-reality environments. We exploit the convergence of artificial-intelligence-enhanced multi-access edge computing, intelligent mobile robots, and blockchain technologies to help realize the Internet of No Things as an important stepping stone toward ushering in the 6G post-smartphone era. In our experiments, we consider locally connected human-avatar/robot collectives and investigate our proposed extrasensory perception network, which integrates the three evolutionary mobile computing stages of ubiquitous, pervasive, and persuasive computing. As an illustrative example of advanced XR experiences, we study the delivery of sixth-sense perceptions that transverse the boundary between Multiverse realms in order to mimic the quantum realm.

TI  - The emergence of explainability of intelligent systems: Delivering explainable and personalized recommendations for energy efficiency
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB  - The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning and deep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in several ways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for a deeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The concept of explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal system mechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems that support human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. In this study, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energy efficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasive recommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. The persuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) or on a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason for recommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using a Telegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data and human feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19% on the recommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasive facts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems, demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energy saving behavior.

TI  - The comprehensive unified paradigm for business model innovation
T2  - TECHNOLOGY ANALYSIS & STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT
AB  - Recognising that there is a growing trend of misfits between a firm's technology/routines and market customer needs due to the exponential technological change and linear-type needs evolution in the age of AI (artificial intelligence), this paper aims at developing a model/theory/paradigm that guarantees to attain the targeted outcome. It firstly draws the necessary conditions of BM/BMI from the natures of AI regime according to which literature review on BM/BMI is done and selects direct causal mechanisms of profit (DCMP) & business model schema (BMS) as the theoretical foundation, classifies all probable circumstances into several contingency settings in terms of environmental changes, technological change, needs evolution and bargaining power, specifies strategic indicators including normative business model (NBM) by contingency setting based on DCMP & BMS, builds the comprehensive unified paradigm (CUP) that introduces new strategising logic 'Seek NBM first & then Get-to-It' through new decision-making mode 'adaptising' with practical rationality, discusses about some vague/dubious notions in strategising, and concludes that CUP works as the general theory of BMI for it holds the universal and contingency rules for BMI simultaneously, asserting that when it comes to BM/BMI, there is nothing more robust, persuasive and practical than the general theory of BMI, CUP.

TI  - How persuasive is AI-generated argumentation? An analysis of the quality of an argumentative text produced by the GPT-3 AI text generator
T2  - ARGUMENT & COMPUTATION
AB  - In this paper, we use a pseudo-algorithmic procedure for assessing an AI-generated text. We apply the Comprehensive Assessment Procedure for Natural Argumentation (CAPNA) in evaluating the arguments produced by an Artificial Intelligence text generator, GPT-3, in an opinion piece written for the Guardian newspaper. The CAPNA examines instances of argumentation in three aspects: their Process, Reasoning and Expression. Initial Analysis is conducted using the Argument Type Identification Procedure (ATIP) to establish, firstly, that an argument is present and, secondly, its specific type in terms of the argument classification framework of the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA). Procedural Questions are then used to test the acceptability of the argument in each of the three aspects. The analysis shows that while the arguments put forward by the AI text generator are varied in terms of their type and follow familiar patterns of human reasoning, they contain obvious weaknesses. From this we can conclude that the automated generation of persuasive, well-reasoned argumentation is a far more difficult task than the generation of meaningful language, and that if AI systems producing arguments are to be persuasive, they require a method of checking the plausibility of their own output.

TI  - Dashboard stories: How narratives told by predictive analytics reconfigure roles, risk and sociality in education
T2  - BIG DATA & SOCIETY
AB  - In this paper, we explore how the development and affordances of predictive analytics may impact how teachers and other educational actors think about and teach students and, more broadly, how society understands education. Our particular focus is on the data dashboards of learning support systems which are based on Machine Learning (ML). While previous research has focused on how these systems produce credible knowledge, we explore here how they also produce compelling, persuasive and convincing narratives. Our main argument is that particular kinds of stories are written by predictive analytics and written into their data dashboards. Based on a case study of a leading predictive analytics system, we explore how data dashboards imply causality between the 'facts' they are visualising. To do so, we analyse the stories they tell according to their spatial and temporal dimensions, characters and events, sequentiality as well as tellability. In the stories we identify, teachers are managers, students are at greater or lesser risk, and students' sociality is reduced to machine-readable interactions. Overall, only data marked as individual behaviours becomes relevant to the system, rendering structural inequalities invisible. Reflecting on the implications of these systems, we suggest ways in which the uptake of these systems can interrupt such stories and reshape them in other directions.

TI  - USING ARGUMENTATION IN TEXT GENERATION
T2  - JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS
AB  - Text generation is a field of artificial intelligence aiming at producing computer models of natural language production. This paper discusses the use of the theory of 'Argumentation in Language' in the field of Text Generation, Most text generators follow the same sequence of steps to produce a coherent paragraph: content determination - selecting of information to include in the text from an underlying computer database; content organization - structuring of the propositions to be included in the text according to an appropriate rhetorical plan; finally lexical choice and syntactic realization - phrasing of the information using appropriate lexical items and syntactically correct constructions. The paper provides examples of the use of argumentative features to influence the generator's decisions throughout the generation process. The introduction of argumentative features allows the designer of a text generator to account for linguistic decisions that were not addressed in previous work, such as the selection of judgment determiners (many, few), scalar adjectives (interesting, difficult), connotative verbs (require, necessitate, enjoy, struggle) and connectives (but, therefore). Argumentative features are also used to organize the paragraph in a coherent manner. They are finally used to select appropriate information from a database to satisfy a given persuasive goal. The paper shows how the same descriptive device - the topoi introduced by Anscombre and Ducrot - can serve as the unifying representation level during the whole generation process and build a bridge between the conceptual and linguistic components of the generator.

TI  - Privacy in Personalized Advertising: A Comprehensive Review and Future Agenda
T2  - COMMUNICATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB  - While personalized advertising may increase customers' desire to engage with a firm, privacy concerns over how firms process data for personalization may reduce their engagement and lead to ad avoidance. As marketers increasingly benefit from personalized advertising, the domain of privacy in personalized advertising (PPA) is gaining attention from researchers in both Marketing and Information Systems areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of extant literature, combining bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the current state, primary themes, and future prospects of the PPA literature. Our research indicates that PPA research is in its early stages of development. While existing literature has predominantly examined privacy, personalization, trust, advertising, social media, and e-commerce, there has been a growing emphasis on targeted advertising and artificial intelligence in more recent studies. PPA is grounded in theoretical frameworks from privacy like Privacy Calculus Theory and from marketing such as the Persuasion Knowledge Model. Given that customer privacy concerns and trust in a firm can influence ad outcomes negatively, it is essential for researchers to explore scenarios where personalization might prove ineffective. In addition, examining firm strategies regarding personalized ads to mitigate negative ad outcomes is crucial.

TI  - Algorithms and complexity results for persuasive argumentation
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - The study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as introduced by Dung (1995) [1] has become one of the most active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning. A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (2003) [8]. extends Dung's framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences.
   Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (2007) [12]. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 28TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT (CIKM '19)
CP  - 28th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management (CIKM)
AB  - Video contents have become a critical tool for promoting products in E-commerce. However, the lack of automatic promotional video generation solutions makes large-scale video-based promotion campaigns infeasible. The first step of automatically producing promotional videos is to generate visual storylines, which is to select the building block footage and place them in an appropriate order. This task is related to the subjective viewing experience. It is hitherto performed by human experts and thus, hard to scale. To address this problem, we propose WundtBackpack, an algorithmic approach to generate storylines based on available visual materials, which can be video clips or images. It consists of two main parts, 1) the Learnable Wundt Curve to evaluate the perceived persuasiveness based on the stimulus intensity of a sequence of visual materials, which only requires a small volume of data to train; and 2) a clustering-based backpacking algorithm to generate persuasive sequences of visual materials while considering video length constraints. In this way, the proposed approach provides a dynamic structure to empower artificial intelligence (AI) to organize video footage in order to construct a sequence of visual stimuli with persuasive power. Extensive real-world experiments show that our approach achieves close to 10% higher perceived persuasiveness scores by human testers, and 12.5% higher expected revenue compared to the best performing state-of-the-art approach.

TI  - Can the Internet of Things Persuade Me? An Investigation Into Power Dynamics in Human-Internet of Things Interaction
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized user experience with objects. Things can perform social roles and convey persuasive messages to users, posing an important research question for communication and human-computer interaction researchers: What are the factors and underlying mechanisms that shape persuasive effects of IoT? Bridging the reactance theory and the computers are social actors paradigm, this study focuses on how power dynamics are shaped in human-IoT interactions and its implications on persuasion. Specifically, the study examines the effects of the social role assigned to the IoT mobile app agent and the scope of IoT controlled by the app on users' perceived power and subsequent persuasive outcomes. The results reveal that when the mobile IoT app is for controlling a smart home, the servant (vs. companion) agent elicits greater perceived power over IoT for users, leading to less threat-to-freedom and better persuasive outcomes, including attitude, intention, and actual behavior. However, such a difference is not observed when the mobile app is for controlling a single smart device (i.e., smart fridge). The study findings offer valuable implications for communication practitioners interested in using IoT as a persuasive tool.

TI  - The gamification and development of a chatbot to promote oral self-care by adopting behavior change wheel for Taiwanese children
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - Background Oral health is closely related to general health and quality of life. School-aged children are at a critical stage for developing their self-care ability in oral health. Digital interventions can encourage and facilitate oral self-care in children.Objective This study aims to present the development of an educational chatbot for school-aged children to address their oral self-care and evaluate its usability.Methods The development and evaluation of the chatbot for oral self-care consisted of four stages: target behavior analysis, intervention design, system development, and the chatbot evaluation. The target behavior analysis identified barriers to children's engagement in oral self-care based on dentists' clinical observations; hence, the requirements for achieving the desired behavior were categorized according to the capability-opportunity-motivation behavior model. Interventional functions were created following the behavior change wheel. A menu-driven chatbot was created and evaluated for usability as well as likeability.Results The barriers and requirements for achieving good behavior in school-aged children's oral self-care were identified by the dental professionals. Intervention strategy incorporated specific functions enriched with gamification features to support school-aged children in developing their abilities for engaging in oral self-care. The intervention functions consist of capability establishment, motivation enhancement, and opportunity creation, which were designed to support children in their oral self-care practices. The designed chatbot was piloted with a convenient sample of 30 school-aged children and their accompanying parents at the pediatric dental clinic. The results indicated good usability, with a mean usability score of 79.91, and high likeability with a mean score of 4.32 out of 5 for the designed chatbot.Conclusions The educational chatbot incorporated a combination of clinical dentistry practice and guidelines, aiming to promote oral self-care behavior in school-aged children. The designed chatbot achieved high scores for its usability and user likability.

TI  - How Do Virtual AI Streamers Influence Viewers' Livestream Shopping Behavior? The Effects of Persuasive Factors and the Mediating Role of Arousal
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB  - With the exponential growth of livestream shopping and the development of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual influencers powered by AI have become a new trend. However, this phenomenon has yet to be studied precisely to understand the underlying mechanisms of virtual AI streamers' influence on the viewers. This study explores the effects of virtual influencers powered by AI by investigating the persuasive factors and underlying emotional mechanism that affect viewers' parasocial interaction intention and impulse buying intention. Data collected from 559 livestream viewers in a scenario-based survey were analyzed using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling (SEM) estimation and cross-validated using Bayesian SEM. The findings confirm the appraisal-emotion-action scheme and validate the role of arousal in mediating three persuasive factors and two behavioral approaches. Parasocial interaction intention was correlated with coolness, whereas congruence and mind perception were important antecedents of viewers' urge to buy impulsively. Furthermore, mindset had important moderating effects on arousal and parasocial interaction intention toward impulsive urges. This study extends the research on influencer marketing and livestream shopping. It also apprises marketing and retailing managers of the importance of nurturing an AI workforce and sheds light on IS management practice for potential industry opportunities.

TI  - A Study of Integrative Bargaining Model with Argumentation-Based Negotiation
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - E-commerce is increasingly competitive and there is a constant need for new approaches and technology to facilitate exchange. Emerging techniques include the use of artificial intelligence (AI). One AI tool that has sparked interest in e-commerce is the automated negotiation agent (negotiation-agent). This study examines such agents, and proposes an offer strategy model of integrative negotiation for a negotiation-agent with a focus on negotiation agent-to-human interaction. More specifically, a new offer strategy was developed based on the integrative bargaining model, which emphasizes the importance of exchanging information among negotiators and multi-issue negotiation that includes package offers to achieve an integrative (win-win) outcome. This study incorporated an argumentation-based negotiation and the negotiation tactic of multiple equivalent simultaneous offers, which was programmed into the negotiation-agent. An experiment was conducted performing 49 negotiation-agent-to-human negotiations over three issues in online purchase tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results indicated that the proposed offer strategy with agent negotiation can enhance the persuasiveness of an offer and the performance of negotiation outcome (human counterpart's perception toward negotiation process, opponent-agent and desire for future negotiation). The findings confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrated an innovative approach to e-commerce transactions.

T2  - COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE
AB  - Chest X-ray (CXR) images are considered useful to monitor and investigate a variety of pulmonary disorders such as COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis (TB). With recent technological advancements, such diseases may now be recognized more precisely using computer-assisted diagnostics. Without compromising the classification accuracy and better feature extraction, deep learning (DL) model to predict four different categories is proposed in this study. The proposed model is validated with publicly available datasets of 7132 chest x-ray (CXR) images. Furthermore, results are interpreted and explained using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Local Interpretable Modelagnostic Explanation (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for better understandably. Initially, convolution features are extracted to collect high-level object-based information. Next, shapely values from SHAP, predictability results from LIME, and heatmap from Grad-CAM are used to explore the black-box approach of the DL model, achieving average test accuracy of 94.31 +/- 1.01% and validation accuracy of 94.54 +/- 1.33 for 10-fold cross validation. Finally, in order to validate the model and qualify medical risk, medical sensations of classification are taken to consolidate the explanations generated from the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework. The results suggest that XAI and DL models give clinicians/medical professionals persuasive and coherent conclusions related to the detection and categorization of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and TB.

T2  - CURRENT BIOINFORMATICS
AB  - The deep learning arena explores new dimensions once considered impossible to human intelligence. Recently, it has taken footsteps in the biological data world to deal with the diverse patterns of data derived from biomolecules. The convolutional neural networks, one of the most employed and persuasive deep learning architectures, can unravel the sequestered truths from these data, especially from the biological sequences. These neural network variants outperform traditional bioinformatics tools for the enduring tasks associated with such sequences.This work imparts an exciting preface to the basics of convolutional neural network architecture and how it can be instrumented to deal with biological sequence analysis.The approach followed in this paper can provide the reader with an enhanced view of convolutional neural networks, their basic working principles and how they apply to biological sequences.A detailed view of critical steps involved in deep learning, starting from the data preprocessing, architecture designing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics, are portrayed. A comparative analysis of convolutional neural network architectures developed for protein family classification is also discussed.This review contributes significantly to understanding the concepts behind deep learning architectures and their applications in biological sequence analysis. It can lift the barrier of limited knowledge to a great extent on the deep learning concepts and their implementation, especially for people who are dealing with pure biology.

TI  - Information Delivered by a Chatbot Has a Positive Impact on COVID-19 Vaccines Attitudes and Intentions
T2  - JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY-APPLIED
AB  - Public Significance Statement Interacting a few minutes with a chatbot answering the most common questions about COVID-19 vaccines increased people's intention to get vaccinated and had a positive impact on their attitudes toward the vaccines. Chatbots could be a powerful resource to fight COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy.
   The Coronavirus disease; COVID-19 vaccines will not end the pandemic if they stay in freezers. In many countries, such as France, COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy is high. It is crucial that governments make it as easy as possible for people who want to be vaccinated to do so, but also that they devise communication strategies to address the concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals. We introduce and test on 701 French participants a novel messaging strategy: A chatbot that answers people's questions about COVID-19 vaccines. We find that interacting with this chatbot for a few minutes significantly increases people's intentions to get vaccinated (ss = 0.12) and has a positive impact on their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (ss = 0.23). Our results suggest that a properly scripted and regularly updated chatbot could offer a powerful resource to help fight hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines.

TI  - Do Humans Prefer Debiased AI Algorithms? A Case Study in Career Recommendation
T2  - IUI'22: 27TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT USER INTERFACES
CP  - 27th Annual International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (ACM IUI)
AB  - Currently, there is a surge of interest in fair Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research which aims to mitigate discriminatory bias in AI algorithms, e.g. along lines of gender, age, and race. While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when human- fair-AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer and more accurate college major recommendations. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that the perceived gender disparity associated with a college major is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, our results demonstrate we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. They also highlight the urgent need to extend the current scope of fair AI research from narrowly focusing on debiasing AI algorithms to including new persuasion and bias explanation technologies in order to achieve intended societal impacts.

TI  - A Survey on Ambient Intelligence in Healthcare
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE
AB  - Ambient Intelligence (AmI) is a new paradigm in information technology aimed at empowering people's capabilities by means of digital environments that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive to human needs, habits, gestures, and emotions. This futuristic vision of daily environment will enable innovative human-machine interactions characterized by pervasive, unobtrusive, and anticipatory communications. Such innovative interaction paradigms make AmI technology a suitable candidate for developing various real life solutions, including in the healthcare domain. This survey will discuss the emergence of AmI techniques in the healthcare domain, in order to provide the research community with the necessary background. We will examine the infrastructure and technology required for achieving the vision of AmI, such as smart environments and wearable medical devices. We will summarize the state-of-the-art artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies used for developing AmI system in the healthcare domain, including various learning techniques (for learning from user interaction), reasoning techniques (for reasoning about users' goals and intensions), and planning techniques (for planning activities and interactions). We will also discuss how AmI technology might support people affected by various physical or mental disabilities or chronic disease. Finally, we will point to some of the successful case studies in the area and we will look at the current and future challenges to draw upon the possible future research paths.

TI  - Discernibility in explanations: Designing more acceptable and meaningful machine learning models for medicine
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL AND STRUCTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY JOURNAL
AB  - Although the benefits of machine learning are undeniable in healthcare, explainability plays a vital role in improving transparency and understanding the most decisive and persuasive variables for prediction. The challenge is to identify explanations that make sense to the biomedical expert. This work proposes discernibility as a new approach to faithfully reflect human cognition, based on the user's perception of a relationship between explanations and data for a given variable. A total of 50 participants (19 biomedical experts and 31 data scientists) evaluated their perception of the discernibility of explanations from both synthetic and human-based datasets (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The low inter-rater reliability of discernibility (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient < 0.5), with no significant difference between areas of expertise or levels of education, highlights the need for an objective metric of discernibility. Thirteen statistical coefficients were evaluated for their ability to capture, for a given variable, the relationship between its values and its explanations using Passing-Bablok regression. Among these, dcor was shown to be a reliable metric for assessing the discernibility of explanations, effectively capturing the clarity of the relationship between the data and their explanations, and providing clues to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms not immediately apparent when examining individual predictors. Discernibility can also serve as an evaluation metric for model quality, helping to prevent overfitting and aiding in feature selection, ultimately providing medical practitioners with more accurate and persuasive results.

TI  - Evaluating Glycemic Control in Patients of South Asian Origin With Type 2 Diabetes Using a Digital Therapeutic Platform: Analysis of Real-World Data
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Digital therapeutics are evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs for the treatment, prevention, or management of a medical disorder or disease. Many studies in the western population have shown the effectiveness of mobile app-based digital therapeutics for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, few studies have assessed similar outcomes in the South Asian population.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate the real-world effectiveness of the Wellthy CARE digital therapeutic for improving glycemic control among the South Asian population of Indian origin.
   Methods: We analyzed deidentified data from 102 patients with T2D from India enrolled in a 16-week structured self-management program delivered using the Wellthy CARE mobile app. Patients recorded their meals, weight, physical activity, and blood sugar in the app, and they received lessons on self-care behaviors (healthy eating, being active, monitoring, medication adherence, problem solving, healthy coping, and reducing risks); feedback provided by an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot; and periodic interactions with certified diabetes educators via voice calls and chats. The primary outcome of the program was a change in glycated hemoglobin A(1c) (HbA(1c)). Secondary outcomes included the difference between preintervention and postintervention fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels; changes in BMI and weight at the completion of 16 weeks; and the association between program engagement and the changes in HbA(1c), FBG, and PPBG levels.
   Results: At the end of 16 weeks, the average change in HbA(1c) was -0.49% (n=102; 95% CI -0.73 to 0.25; P<.001). Of all the patients, 63.7% (65/102) had improved HbA(1c) levels, with a mean change of -1.16% (n=65; 95% CI -1.40 to -0.92; P<.001). The mean preintervention and postintervention FBG levels were 145 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 135-155) and 134 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 122-146; P=.02) and PPBG levels were 188 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 172-203) and 166 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 153-180; P=.03), respectively. The mean changes in BMI and weight were -0.47 kg/m(2) (n=59; 95% CI -0.22 to -0.71; P<.001) and -1.32 kg (n=59; 95% CI -0.63 to -2.01; P<.001), respectively. There was a stepwise decrease in HbA(1c), FBG, and PPBG levels as the program engagement increased. Patients in the highest tertile of program engagement had a significantly higher reduction in HbA(1c) (-0.84% vs -0.06%; P=.02), FBG (-21.4 mg/dL vs -0.18 mg/dL; P=.02), and PPBG levels (-22.03 mg/dL vs 2.35 mg/dL; P=.002) than those in the lowest tertile.
   Conclusions: The use of the Wellthy CARE digital therapeutic for patients with T2D showed a significant reduction in the levels of HbA(1c), FBG, and PPBG after 16 weeks. A higher level of participation showed improved glycemic control, suggesting the potential of the Wellthy CARE platform for better management of the disease.

TI  - Affective TV: Concepts of Affective Computing Applied to Digital Television
T2  - DESIGN, USER EXPERIENCE, AND USABILITY, DUXU 2024, PT V
CP  - 13th International Conference on Design, User Experience and Usability (DUXU)
AB  - The traditional broadcast TV viewing experience has barely evolved since its inception, remaining mostly static despite many technical advances. Smart TVs show attempts of filling this gap, but present challenges, such as limiting functionalities to specific models and lack of standardization. Privacy concerns arise as smart TVs connect to advertising and monitoring services. In the spectrum of interactivity, an option that stands out is affective computing, an interdisciplinary field that seeks to develop systems capable of recognizing, expressing and responding to human emotions. This work proposes the incorporation of affective computing techniques and concepts to improve the experience and interactivity with digital TV, naming it "Affective TV". The work presents a modular architecture, recognition modules developed for multiple modes of interaction and a fully operational implementation of the architecture, developed for the standard digital TV middleware in Brazil, Ginga. Affective TV uses audio and video capturing devices and allows users to set up their environments. Recognition modules capture and classify data, communicating directly to the TV middleware. Proof-of-concept applications, incorporating voice and hand pose interactions with facial expression recognition, were evaluated using the GQM. UEQ-S and TAM questionnaires were employed. Very positive results were obtained, including an excellent UEQ rating, showcasing technical feasibility, attractiveness, user experience, perceived usefulness, and ease of use. The proposal enriches the digital TV experience, providing a novel, interactive model with user-centric customization and emotion-driven responses.

TI  - Adding Dynamic Norm to Environmental Information in Messages Promoting the Reduction of Meat Consumption
T2  - ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNICATION-A JOURNAL OF NATURE AND CULTURE
AB  - Research has shown that dynamic norm information can promote pro-environmental actions (i.e. information indicating that a growing number of people are behaving pro-environmentally). Yet, the question remains whether adding dynamic norm information would increase the effectiveness of information on the environmental consequences of behavior. We compared the effects of environmental information with versus without dynamic norm information on encouraging reductions in meat consumption, and whether effects would depend on receivers' intrinsic motivation. We also explored whether message effectiveness would vary according to receivers' intrinsic motivation to reduce meat consumption. In total 197 volunteers participated in a one-month messaging intervention through a chatbot. Results showed that both environmental and environmental + dynamic norm messages increased positive attitude towards reducing meat consumption, and decreased meat consumption. These effects were still present at follow-up (i.e. one month after the intervention stopped). Interestingly, both messages particularly persuaded receivers with a relatively weak intrinsic motivation to reduce meat consumption, while environmental only messages were even counterproductive in receivers with a relatively strong intrinsic motivation. These results advance our comprehension of the effects of messages aimed at reducing meat consumption.

TI  - Convincing Audio Generation Based on LLM and Speech Tokenization
T2  - 2024 IEEE 14TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON CHINESE SPOKEN LANGUAGE PROCESSING, ISCSLP 2024
CP  - 14th International Symposium on Chinese Spoken Language Processing
AB  - This report describes the work submitted by the ZYZX-AI team to ICAGC 2024. This challenge, titled "Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024," is part of the ISC-SLP 2024 Competitions and Challenges track, aims to enhance the persuasiveness and acceptability of synthesized audio, focusing on human alignment convincing and inspirational audio generation. Our solution combines speech discretization, a language modeling approach, and waveform reconstruction by a vocoder based on speech tokens.First, the input audio is mapped to a sequence of discrete tokens, audio generation as a language modeling task in this representational space. Subsequently, a neural audio codec uses the predicted discrete speech tokens in conjunction with the text to be synthesized to achieve high-quality audio generation. These models are trained on diverse datasets including open-source corpora such as wenetspeech4TTS and magicData. Unlike speech recognition tasks, speech synthesis tasks require higher-quality annotations in their training datasets. To address this issue, methods such as speech enhancement, loudness processing, and adjustments to punctuation in text annotations are applied during the data preprocessing stage to improve data quality. Our submission achieved third place on the track1(Inspirational Emotion Modulation), with an average MOS value of 3.56.

TI  - A comparative analysis of CDC and AI-generated health information using computer-aided text analysis
T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION IN HEALTHCARE
AB  - BackgroundAI-generated content is easy to access. Members of the public use it as an alternative or to supplement official sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the quality and reliability of AI-generated health information is questionable. This study aims to understand how AI-generated health information differs from that provided by the CDC, particularly in terms of sentiment, readability, and overall quality. Language expectancy theory serves as a framework and offers insights into how people's expectations of message content from different sources can influence perceived credibility and persuasiveness of such information.MethodsComputer-aided text analysis was used to analyze 20 text entries from the CDC and 20 entries generated by ChatGPT 3.5. Content analysis utilizing human coders was used to assess the quality of information.ResultsChatGPT used more negative sentiments, particularly words associated with anger, sadness, and disgust. The CDC's health messages were significantly easier to read than those generated by ChatGPT. Furthermore, ChatGPT's responses required a higher reading grade level. In terms of quality, the CDC's information was a little higher quality than that of ChatGPT, with significant differences in DISCERN scores.ConclusionPublic health professionals need to educate the general public about the complexity and quality of AI-generated health information. Health literacy programs should address topics about quality and readability of AI-generated content. Other recommendations for using AI-generated health information are provided.

T2  - 2014 11TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UBIQUITOUS ROBOTS AND AMBIENT INTELLIGENCE (URAI)
CP  - 11th International Conference on Ubiquitous Robots and Ambient Intelligence (URAI)
AB  - The collaboration between humans and intelligent agents keeps increasing as the technology advances. In this sense, each can rely on the other's strengths to achieve the best overall performance. But as intelligent agents play an increasingly escalating role as a partner rather than mere tools, it is imperative that we understand how humans are influenced by such agents. This is so as to achieve a certain level of persuasiveness to ensure human compliance with intelligent agents in times of need, and also prevent over-reliance on such agents, which may make humans susceptible to manipulation. Reviewing the literature from human-computer interaction, persuasion, and decision-making processes, this study examined the effect of labelling source expertise (i.e., title) on the human decision-making process, when there is not an agreement between human and robot partners. Specifically, we conducted an experiment (n = 88) to investigate how perceived expertise of a robot resulted in the attractiveness, intelligence and credibility of the robot, and how these perceptions influence the level of cooperation and compliance in a desert survival game. The results showed that participants evaluated the robot as more credible when labelled as expert, compared to when labelled as novice. The results of a mediation analysis also showed that perceived credibility successfully mediated the effect of title on cooperation and compliance when there was a conflict in the ranking order of items between each participant and the robot. Implications for future development of artificial intelligence and future research directions are discussed.

TI  - Prognostication of waste water treatment plant performance using efficient soft computing models: An environmental evaluation
T2  - MEASUREMENT
AB  - The chief purpose of designing the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is to provide a suitable system which is capable of eliminating the excessive impurities or pollutants found in the influent to the desired level. In this way, daily flow rates is one of the most crucial components to contribute in order to design wastewater treatment processes and plant units. So, in the present research work, various soft computing approaches including feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to predict daily flow rates for the WWTP. To develop artificial intelligence models, flow rates datasets has been used over a five-year period. The performance of the proposed models were assessed for training and testing stages using statistical error indicators. Performance of techniques indicated that SVM (RMSE = 1435.4 and MAE = 1031.1) and FFBP-NN (RMSE = 1445.9 and MAE = 1036.7) techniques have provided more precise prediction of flow rates compared to the ANFIS (RMSE = 1515.6 and MAE = 1075.4) and RBF-NN (RMSE = 1501 and MAE = 1048.7). This study was proven that soft computing techniques, as robust tools, can be efficiently applied to design the flow rates in the WWTP with a persuasive degree of accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Risk and Exposure of XAI in Persuasion and Argumentation: The case of Manipulation
T2  - EXPLAINABLE AND TRANSPARENT AI AND MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS, EXTRAAMAS 2022
CP  - 4th International Workshop on Explainable and Transparent AI and Multi-Agent Systems (EXTRAAMAS)
AB  - In the last decades, Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly adopted in assistive (possibly collaborative) decision-making tools. In particular, AI-based persuasive technologies are designed to steer/influence users' behaviour, habits, and choices to facilitate the achievement of their own - predetermined - goals. Nowadays, the inputs received by the assistive systems leverage heavily AI data-driven approaches. Thus, it is imperative to have transparent and understandable (to the user) both the process leading to the recommendations and the recommendations. The Explainable AI (XAI) community has progressively contributed to "opening the black box" , ensuring the interaction's effectiveness, and pursuing the safety of the individuals involved. However, principles and methods ensuring the efficacy and information retain on the human have not been introduced yet. The risk is to underestimate the context dependency and subjectivity of the explanations' understanding, interpretation, and relevance. Moreover, even a plausible (and possibly expected) explanation can lead to an imprecise or incorrect outcome or its understanding. This can lead to unbalanced and unfair circumstances, such as giving a financial advantage to the system owner/provider and the detriment of the user.
   This paper highlights that the sole explanations - especially in the context of persuasive technologies - are not self-sufficient to protect users' psychological and physical integrity. Conversely, explanations could be misused, becoming themselves a tool of manipulation. Therefore, we suggest characteristics safeguarding the explanation from being manipulative and legal principles to be used as criteria for evaluating the operation of XAI systems, both from an ex-ante and ex-post perspective.

TI  - Using dialogues to increase positive attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines in a vaccine-hesitant UK population
T2  - ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE
AB  - Recently, Altay et al. (Altay et al. 2021. J. Exp.Psychol.: Appl. ()) showed that 5 min of interaction with a chatbot led to increases in positive COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and intentions in a French population. Here we replicate this effect in a vaccine-hesitant, UK-based population. We attempt to isolate what made the chatbot condition effective by controlling the amount of information provided, the trustworthiness of the information and the level of interactivity. Like Altay et al., our experiment allowed participants to navigate a branching dialogue by choosing questions of interest about COVID-19 vaccines. Our control condition used the same questions and answers but removed participant choice by presenting the dialogues at random. Importantly, we also targeted those who were either against or neutral towards COVID-19 vaccinations to begin with, screening-out those with already positive attitudes. Replicating Altay et al., we found a similar size increase in positive attitudes towards vaccination, and in intention to get vaccinated. Unlike Altay et al., we found no difference between our two conditions: choosing the questions did not increase vaccine attitudes or intentions any more than our control condition. These results suggest that the attitudes of the vaccine hesitant are modifiable with exposure to in-depth, trustworthy and engaging dialogues.

TI  - A WISER intervention to combat the influence of misinformation on social media
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - PurposeMisinformation is a major threat to individual, organizational and societal well-being. Combating it requires change on multiple levels. The purpose of this paper is to describe two co-created initiatives designed to holistically reduce the prevalence and effects of misinformation on social media.Design/methodology/approachThe authors adopted a co-creation approach by convening a stakeholder group including social media, advertising, artificial intelligence and advocacy leaders. The authors also engaged social media users to collectively generate, test and implement an anti-misinformation strategy. These stakeholders shaped the development of the tools described in this paper.FindingsFirst, the authors present a Social Media Ecosystem Map and Incentive Analysis that achieve impact by documenting avenues for action. Second, the authors illustrate impact at the user level by developing and disseminating the WISER framework, which delivers an implementable and memorable anti-misinformation strategy.Research limitations/implicationsStrategies tailored to the needs and characteristics of stakeholders are most likely to be persuasive. The discoveries and conclusions incorporate the contexts of the stakeholders with whom the authors collaborated. Future work will reveal recommendations for a broader audience.Practical implicationsThe Social Media Ecosystem Map, Incentive Analysis and WISER framework represent promising foundations to spark novel insights and actions for ways to be WISER about information on social media.Originality/valueImpact is often limited because strategies are developed in academic, corporate or policy silos. The authors adopt an original approach by exchanging knowledge among industry, academia and users with the aim of maximizing effectiveness and adoption.

TI  - Is a picture worth a thousand views? Measuring the effects of travel photos on user engagement using deep learning algorithms
T2  - ELECTRONIC MARKETS
AB  - Travel photos inform and inspire consumers by conveying a first-hand destination experience. Despite the proliferation of consumer-generated travel photos in online travel review sites, deconstructing the effects of photos on consumer engagement remains a challenge to the tourism industry. We provide a framework to process and interpret various photographic elements on user engagement using deep learning algorithms. We posit that a photo can invoke consumers' subjective interpretations of photos representing authentic, creative, or emotional dimensions of the destination experience. A structured crowdsourced categorization process was deployed to measure the interpretive dimensions of the photos. The objects in photographs are identified using a novel deep learning algorithm for controls. We use narrative framing concepts to theorize their influence on user engagement in an online travel review site setting. Relevant three sets of hypotheses are tested using a large dataset of photo-based travel reviews sampled between 2012 and 2014. A negative zero-inflated binomial regression is used to estimate the effect of subjective interpretation of photos on user engagement, accounting for overdispersed excess zeros associated with count outcomes. Results support the hypotheses. The additional analyses explore other plausible influential attributes to user engagements to complement our main findings. We discuss the theoretical contributions to the online-image-persuasion stream of research and practical implications for online tourist review sites.

TI  - Enhancing Transformative Learning and Innovation Skills Using Remote Learning for Sustainable Architecture Design
T2  - SUSTAINABILITY
AB  - The currently used educational technology with artificial-intelligence-powered solutions, although rather instrumental, may lead to discontinuity in learning, as it lacks social and emotional value, which is an essential part of education for sustainable development and results in an immersive experience through which higher-order thinking skills can be adopted. This paper aims to explore transformative learning (TL) and innovation skill improvement accommodated by transactional distance theory in a 16-week remote sustainable architecture design course. The analysis identified the following: (a) significant progress in students' attitudes toward uncertainty and criticality while social support differs due to the influence of classmates, faculty staff, teamwork, writing and reading assignments, promoters from industry and extracurricular activities; (b) significant progress in TL achievement while innovation skill development differs significantly across the groups in which online collaborative learning was found as an influencer in creativity and motivation; (c) self-efficacy influenced by feedback in and on actions, such as essay and other writing assignments, verbal persuasions and positive social comparisons; (d) lack of development of situational awareness, continuity of learning and interactions/situations to empower teammates in handling conflicts to develop leadership ability; (e) decrease in risk-taking ability, especially in a group of students in which social support was limited due to the absence of challenging situations and tasks. The results support the use of remote intervention directed at prosocial motivations and action-focused group goals.

TI  - Enhancing legal writing skills: The impact of formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY
AB  - Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced educational technologies, reshaping the teaching and learning landscape. However, the notion of fully automating the teaching process remains contentious. This paper explores the concept of hybrid intelligence (HI), which emphasizes the synergistic collaboration between AI and humans to optimize learning outcomes. Despite the potential of AI-enhanced learning systems, their application in a human-AI collaboration system often fails to meet anticipated standards, and there needs to be more empirical evidence showcasing their effectiveness. To address this gap, this study investigates whether formative feedback in an HI learning environment helps law students learn from their errors and write more structured and persuasive legal texts. We conducted a field experiment in a law course to analyse the impact of formative feedback on the exam results of 43 law students, as well as on the writer (students), the writing product and the writing process. In the control group, students received feedback conforming to the legal common practice, where they solved legal problems and subsequently received general feedback from a lecturer based on a sample solution. Students in the treatment group were provided with formative feedback that specifically targeted their individual errors, thereby stimulating internal cognitive processes within the students. Our investigation revealed that participants who were provided with formative feedback rooted in their errors within structured and persuasive legal writing outperformed the control group in producing qualitative, better legal text during an exam. Furthermore, the analysed qualitative student statements also suggest that formative feedback promotes students' self-efficacy and self-regulated learning. Our findings indicate that integrating formative feedback rooted in individual errors enhances students' legal writing skills. This underscores the hybrid nature of AI, empowering students to identify their errors and improve in a more self-regulated manner.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Collaboration between humans and AI in educational settings advances learning mutually, fostering a unified developmental process. Collaborative education models advocate leveraging human and AI strengths for adaptive learning. Despite abundant theoretical research, empirical studies in HI remain limited. This gap underscores the need for more evidence-based approaches in integrating AI into educational settings. What this paper adds Field experiment investigating the impact of formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment based on the theory of learning from errors. Comparison of a traditional legal learning environment (lecturer teaching using sample solutions) versus formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment. Implementing formative machine learning-based feedback supports law students in producing more structured and persuasive legal texts, leading to enhanced exam performance and higher grades. Implications for practice and/or policy Our research contributes significantly to computer-based education by presenting empirical evidence of how formative writing feedback impacts students' legal knowledge and skills in educational settings. This underscores the importance of incorporating empirical data into the development of AI-based educational tools to ensure their effectiveness.
   By focusing on individual errors corrected by formative feedback, we contribute to the learning from errors literature stream. This perspective offers valuable insights into how such feedback can support students' writing and learning processes, filling a gap in empirical evidence. Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of ML-based learning systems, particularly in large-scale learning environments like legal mass lectures. Formative writing feedback emerges as a scalable and beneficial addition to traditional learning environments, triggering internal learning processes, fostering self-regulated learning and increasing self-efficacy among students. By demonstrating the effectiveness of formative feedback within the framework of HI, particularly in legal education, our research underscores the potential of combining human understanding with AI-supported feedback to enhance learning outcomes.

TI  - Effects of AI and Logic-Style Explanations on Users' Decisions Under Different Levels of Uncertainty
T2  - ACM TRANSACTIONS ON INTERACTIVE INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS
AB  - Existing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques support people in interpreting AI advice. However, although previous work evaluates the users' understanding of explanations, factors influencing the decision support are largely overlooked in the literature. This article addresses this gap by studying the impact of user uncertainty, AI correctness, and the interaction between AI uncertainty and explanation logic-styles for classification tasks. We conducted two separate studies: one requesting participants to recognize handwritten digits and one to classify the sentiment of reviews. To assess the decision making, we analyzed the task performance, agreement with the AI suggestion, and the user's reliance on the XAI interface elements. Participants make their decision relying on three pieces of information in the XAI interface (image or text instance, AI prediction, and explanation). Participants were shown one explanation style (between-participants design) according to three styles of logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, and abductive). This allowed us to study how different levels of AI uncertainty influence the effectiveness of different explanation styles. The results show that user uncertainty and AI correctness on predictions significantly affected users' classification decisions considering the analyzedmetrics. In both domains (images and text), users reliedmainly on the instance to decide. Users were usually overconfident about their choices, and this evidence was more pronounced for text. Furthermore, the inductive style explanations led to overreliance on the AI advice in both domains-it was the most persuasive, even when the AI was incorrect. The abductive and deductive styles have complex effects depending on the domain and the AI uncertainty levels.

TI  - Digital transformation and pollution emission of enterprises: Evidence from China's micro-enterprises
T2  - ENERGY REPORTS
AB  - Based on pollution emission data and digital product import data of Chinese industrial enterprises from 2000 to 2013, this paper takes enterprise digital imported products as a natural experiment to build a model of multiple phase difference in difference (DID) to investigate the pollution reduction effect of enterprise digital transformation. The research results show that the digital transformation of enterprises can significantly reduce their pollution emissions. The strong persuasive and robustness of the model results are verified by substituting variables, eliminating interference value, excluding other factors, time lag effect and factor sensitivity analysis. When the overall digital transformation level of non-polluting enterprises in the city where polluting enterprises are located is used as an instrumental variable to deal with the potential endogeneity problem, the results still hold. Due to the relatively high level of environmental regulation in the eastern region, the central and western regions undertake low-end manufacturing industries and have limited economic development. So, the environmental governance effect of enterprises in the eastern region is more significant than that in the central and western regions. The strong agglomeration in coastal areas makes the emission reduction effect more significant. The environmental governance effect of enterprise digitization is mainly reflected in foreign capital, collective and large and medium-sized enterprises. Enterprise digitization and technological innovation jointly promote the pollution reduction of enterprises, and enterprise digitization transformation only has the "end treatment"effect.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

TI  - They misused me! Digital literacy's dual role in AI marketing manipulation and unethical young consumer behavior
T2  - YOUNG CONSUMERS
AB  - PurposeArtificial intelligence (AI)-driven marketing has transformed the landscape of consumer interactions, but it also raises ethical concerns regarding perceived manipulation and subsequent unethical young consumer behavior. This study aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of AI-driven marketing on unethical young consumer behavior, with digital literacy as a moderating variable. The authors introduce and conceptualize a digital literacy construct that influences how young consumers perceive and react to manipulative AI-driven marketing tactics.Design/methodology/approachUsing the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM), this research explores how digital literacy influences the reception of AI-driven marketing and moderates the effects of perceived manipulative tactics. This study adopts a three-wave, time-lagged survey method among young consumers in urban Pakistan, integrating measures of AI-driven marketing techniques, perceived manipulation, digital literacy and unethical consumer behavior.FindingsThe results reveal that perceived manipulation mediates the relationship between AI-driven marketing and unethical young consumer behavior. Digital literacy significantly moderates this effect, indicating that higher digital literacy levels can mitigate the negative impacts of perceived manipulation. Conversely, lower digital literacy amplifies the negative impacts of perceived manipulation.Practical implicationsThe findings underscore the need for marketers to foster transparency and ethical practices in AI-driven strategies. Enhancing consumer digital literacy can serve as a protective factor against unethical marketing practices.Originality/valueThis study contributes to the understanding of digital literacy's protective role against unethical AI-driven marketing practices. It extends existing models of persuasion and consumer response by demonstrating how digital literacy reshapes traditional consumer response frameworks in the context of AI-driven environments.

TI  - eHealth Initiatives for The Promotion of Healthy Lifestyle and Allied Implementation Difficulties
T2  - 2019 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON WIRELESS AND MOBILE COMPUTING, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS (WIMOB)
CP  - 15th International Conference on Wireless and Mobile Computing, Networking and Communications (WiMob)
AB  - Research in eHealth has opened a new dimension to improve personal healthcare with the help of information and communication technologies (ICT). eHealth is an 'umbrella term' for the use of ICT for health. Remote care-giving technologies (mHealth, Telehealth, Telemedicine) are an extended branch of eHealth initiatives. The concept of health e-Coaching is another promising initiative of eHealth research for real-time personalized lifestyle support. The focus of eHealth initiatives is to deliver high quality, evidence-based, secure, cost-effective, timely care to support people for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. However, the practical implementation of different eHealth initiatives has often been challenging to establish prophesied benefit. Health monitoring and fitness coaching with artificial intelligence will rule the coming decades. The pillars of e-Coaching initiatives are data collection, analysis of data, recommendation (sending the right message to the right people in the right context) and data security. An optimized system for health e-Coaching, management of a huge amount of health data, ensuring data protection are some big challenges to the eHealth researchers. Prediction of human psychology for effective e-Coaching recommendation is another level of difficulty to overcome as human behavior is constantly changing. Different eHealth initiatives for the promotion of healthy lifestyle and its implementation difficulties have been our primary focus of the review in this paper. This paper is a result of our early stage research related to 'Health e-Coaching recommendation system generation'. This paper will help young eHealth researchers to have a holistic idea on different eHealth technologies, initiatives till date for the promotion of healthy lifestyle and associated implementation challenges to overcome in the future.

TI  - Behavioral Nudges as Patient Decision Support for Medication Adherence: The ENCOURAGE Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - AMERICAN HEART JOURNAL
AB  - Background Medication adherence is generally low and challenging to address because patient actions control healthcare delivery outside of medical environments. Behavioral nudging changes clinician behavior, but nudging patient decision-making requires further testing. This trial evaluated whether behavioral nudges can increase statin adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC).
   Methods In a 12-month parallel-group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, adult patients in Intermountain Healthcare cardiology clinics were enrolled. Inclusion required an indication for statins and membership in SelectHealth insurance. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to control or nudges. Nudge content, timing, frequency, and delivery route were personalized by CareCentra using machine learning of subject motivations and abilities from psychographic assessment, demographics, social determinants, and the Intermountain Mortality Risk Score. PDC calculation used SelectHealth claims data.
   Results Among 182 subjects, age averaged 63.2 +/- 8.5 years, 25.8% were female, baseline LDL-C was 82.5 perpendicular to 32.7 mg/dL, and 93.4% had coronary disease. Characteristics were balanced between nudge ( n = 89) and control arms ( n = 93). The statin PDC was greater at 12 months in the nudge group (PDC: 0.742 +/- 0.318) compared to controls (PDC: 0.639 +/- 0.358, P = 0.042). Adherent subjects (PDC >= 80%) were more concentrated in the nudge group (66.3% vs controls: 50.5%, P = 0.036) while a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization was non-significant
   Conclusions Persuasive behavioral nudges driven by artificial intelligence resulted in a clinically important increase in statin adherence in general cardiology patients. This precision patient decision support utilized computerized nudge design and delivery with minimal on-going human input.

TI  - Influencer Marketing, Narrative Transportation, and Consumer Well-Being: An Exploration of How Virtual Influencers Impact Followers' Well-Being
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONSUMER STUDIES
AB  - With recent advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence and computer-generated imagery, virtual influencers (VIs) have become prominent branding tools that command high engagement rates. Most extant research explores the marketing outcomes of using VIs in brand campaigns. However, little is known about how interacting with VIs on social media platforms may affect consumers' well-being. This research takes a comprehensive approach, developing a nuanced understanding of whether (and how) human-like VIs (HVIs) impact consumers' well-being. We employ a conceptual development approach drawing on scholarship from influencer marketing, narrative transportation, and consumer well-being and gather additional support for the conceptual framework from data collected by interviewing 25 followers of HVIs. The conceptual framework proposes that when interacting with influencers' social media posts, followers experience narrative transportation, which positively influences followers' hedonic and eudaimonic well-being. However, the conceptual framework also proposes that these relationships are moderated by the type of influencer (human vs. virtual) sharing the post. Specifically, we suggest that interactions with HVIs provide followers with enjoyment (hedonic well-being) and support their self-acceptance, personal growth, relationships, and autonomy (eudaimonic well-being). We also provide initial evidence of the favorable marketing outcomes of enhanced well-being from engagement with HVIs, including contemplation of brand purchase. The study thus advances extant VI literature by proposing a theoretically and empirically informed conceptual model that examines HVIs' influence on consumer well-being. Also, it contributes to addressing the broader calls for research on the impact of social media and influencer marketing on consumer well-being.

TI  - The softening of Chinese digital propaganda: Evidence from the People's Daily Weibo account during the pandemic
T2  - FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB  - IntroductionSocial media infuses modern relationships with vitality and brings a series of information dissemination with subjective consciousness. Studies have indicated that official Chinese media channels are transforming their communication style from didactic hard persuasion to softened emotional management in the digital era. However, previous studies have rarely provided valid empirical evidence for the communicational transformation. The study fills the gap by providing a longitudinal time-series analysis to reveal the pattern of communication of Chinese digital Chinese official media from 2019 to 2022. MethodThe study crawler collected 43,259 posts from the People's Daily's Weibo account from 2019 to 2021. The study analyzed the textual data with using trained artificial intelligence models. ResultsThis study explored the practices of the People's Daily's Weibo account from 2019 to 2021, COVID-19 is hardly normalized as it is still used as the justification for extraordinary measures in China. This study confirmed that People's Daily's Weibo account posts are undergoing softenization transformation, with the use of soft news, positive energy promotion, and the embedding of sentiment. Although the outburst of COVID-19 temporarily increased the media's use of hard news, it only occur at the initial stage of the pandemic. Emotional posts occupy a nonnegligible amount of the People's Daily Weibo content. However, the majority of posts are emotionally neutral and contribute to shaping the authoritative image of the party press. DiscussionOverall, the People's Daily has softened their communication style on digital platforms and used emotional mobilization, distraction, and timely information provision to balance the political logic of building an authoritative media agency and the media logic of constructing audience relevance.

TI  - Will virtual rehabilitation replace clinicians: a contemporary debate about technological versus human obsolescence
T2  - JOURNAL OF NEUROENGINEERING AND REHABILITATION
AB  - This article is inspired by a pseudo Oxford-style debate, which was held in Tel Aviv University, Israel at the International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR) 2019, which is the official conference of the International Society for Virtual Rehabilitation. The debate, between two 2-person teams with a moderator, was organized by the ICVR Program committee to address the question "Will virtual rehabilitation replace clinicians?" It brought together five academics with technical, research, and/or clinical backgrounds-Gerry Fluet, Tal Krasovsky, Anat Lubetzky, Philippe Archambault, W. Geoffrey Wright-to debate the pros and cons of using virtual reality (VR) and related technologies to help assess, diagnose, treat, and track recovery, and more specifically investigate the likelihood that advanced technology will ultimately replace human clinicians. Both teams were assigned a side to defend, whether it represented their own viewpoint or not, and to take whatever positions necessary to make a persuasive argument and win the debate. In this paper we present a recapitulation of the arguments presented by both sides, and further include an in-depth consideration of the question. We attempt to judiciously lay out a number of arguments that fall along a spectrum from moderate to extreme; the most extreme and/or indefensible positions are presented for rhetorical and demonstrative purposes. Although there may not be a clear answer today, this paper raises questions which are related to the basic nature of the rehabilitation profession, and to the current and potential role of technology within it.

TI  - Interactive Computing Technology in Anti-Bullying Education: The Effects of Conversation-Bot's Role on K-12 Students' Attitude Change Toward Bullying Problems
T2  - JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL COMPUTING RESEARCH
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an anti-bullying activity that utilizes conversational virtual agents (called conversation-bots or chatbots) on students' attitudes toward bullying problems. An experimental pre- or posttest design with a three-group setting was used. Eighty-nine fifth-grade students were assigned to one of three groups: Conversation with a virtual agent of (a) bully's role, (b) victim's role, and (c) teacher's role. All agents are conversation-bots designed to support learner-computer interactions. The bully agent defends the notion that bullying behaviors are acceptable whereas the victim agent argues that bullying behavior cannot be tolerated. The teacher agent teaches students the types of bullying and its negative aspects. The participants completed an anti-bullying attitude test at pre- and posttest, which included students' anti-bully, intention, pro-victim, behavior, and self-efficacy factors. The results show that students' attitudes toward bullying problems changed to more positive responses after the implementation that used the conversation-bot. In addition, the results revealed that the agent's role had an impact on the students' attitudes toward the anti-bully factor. Implications and future research regarding the use of conversation-bots in education are discussed.

We identified randomized controlled studies (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and non-experimental studies from the following platforms: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo, and EMBASE databases. A total of 12 eligible studies published from 2019 to 2023 were analyzed and summarized. In particular, one RCT showed that a chatbot-delivered tailored intervention was more effective than a chatbot-delivered non-tailored intervention in promoting seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among older adults (50.5% versus 35.3%, p = 0.002). Six RCTs were included in the meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of chatbot interventions to improve vaccination attitudes and intentions. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of overall attitude change was 0.34 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.13, 0.55, p = 0.001). We found a non-significant trivial effect of chatbot interventions on improving intentions of vaccination (SMD: 0.11, 95% CI: -0.13, 0.34, p = 0.38). However, further evidence is needed to draw a more precise conclusion. Additionally, study participants reported high satisfaction levels of using the chatbot and were likely to recommend it to others. The development of chatbots is still nascent and rooms for improvement exist.

TI  - Automated Personalized Feedback for Physical Activity and Dietary Behavior Change With Mobile Phones: A Randomized Controlled Trial on Adults
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users'behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement.
   Objective: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions.
   Methods: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions.
   Results: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001).
   Conclusions: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed.

TI  - Predicting Disengagement to Better Support Outcomes in a Web-Based Weight Loss Program Using Machine Learning Models: Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Engagement is key to interventions that achieve successful behavior change and improvements in health. There is limited literature on the application of predictive machine learning (ML) models to data from commercially available weight loss programs to predict disengagement. Such data could help participants achieve their goals. Objective: This study aimed to use explainable ML to predict the risk of member disengagement week by week over 12 weeks on a commercially available web-based weight loss program. Methods: Data were available from 59,686 adults who participated in the weight loss program between October 2014 and September 2019. Data included year of birth, sex, height, weight, motivation to join the program, use statistics (eg, weight entries, entries into the food diary, views of the menu, and program content), program type, and weight loss. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and logistic regression with L1 regularization models were developed and validated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. In addition, temporal validation was performed on a test cohort of 16,947 members who participated in the program between April 2018 and September 2019, and the remaining data were used for model development. Shapley values were used to identify globally relevant features and explain individual predictions. Results: The average age of the participants was 49.60 (SD 12.54) years, the average starting BMI was 32.43 (SD 6.19), and 81.46% (39,594/48,604) of the participants were female. The class distributions (active and inactive members) changed from 39,369 and 9235 in week 2 to 31,602 and 17,002 in week 12, respectively. With 10-fold-cross-validation, extreme gradient boosting models had the best predictive performance, which ranged from 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.85) to 0.93 (95% CI 0.93-0.93) for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and from 0.57 (95% CI 0.56-0.58) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.95-0.96) for area under the precision-recall curve (across 12 weeks of the program). They also presented a good calibration. Results obtained with temporal validation ranged from 0.51 to 0.95 for area under a precision-recall curve and 0.84 to 0.93 for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the 12 weeks. There was a considerable improvement in area under a precision-recall curve of 20% in week 3 of the program. On the basis of the computed Shapley values, the most important features for predicting disengagement in the following week were those related to the total activity on the platform and entering a weight in the previous weeks. Conclusions: This study showed the potential of applying ML predictive algorithms to help predict and understand participants' disengagement with a web-based weight loss program. Given the association between engagement and health outcomes, these findings can prove valuable in providing better support to individuals to enhance their engagement and potentially achieve greater weight loss.

TI  - Social Media Analytics and Its Applications in Marketing
T2  - FOUNDATIONS AND TRENDS IN MARKETING
AB  - The rise of the Internet and smartphones in the 21st century has created and developed social media as an extremely effective means of communication in society. In life, business, sports, and politics, social media facilitates the democratization of ideas like never before. Social media content gives consumers different information sources that they must decipher to discern its trustworthiness and influence in their own opinions. Marketers must be savvy about using social media in their attempts to persuade consumers and build brand equity.
   As social media has permeated our everyday lives, scholars in various disciplines are actively conducting research into this aspect regarding our way of life. In this scholarly endeavor, marketing has taken a leading role in this research endeavor as a discipline involving human communications and idea persuasion. Thus, rather than considering social media broadly across multiple disciplines, in this monograph, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing.
   This monograph comprises the following four sections:
   First, we provide an overview of social media and social media analytics (SMA). While much has already been said about social media generally, relatively less has been said about social media analytics. Thus, much of our focus is on SMA in terms of contributing to the current understanding of SMA in the field.
   Second, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. We discuss practical industry perspectives and examples, as well as recent marketing research by academics. Notably, we show how analytics may be used to address concerns about social media privacy and help detect fake reviews.
   Third, we summarize common tools for social media analytics in marketing. These methods can be complex, but they must be mastered for sound SMA practice. They encompass big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and visual analytics.
   Fourth, we discuss trends and a future research agenda. We also discuss how SMA might be better integrated into higher education.

TI  - Virtual education strategies in the context of sustainable health care and medical education: A topic modelling analysis of four decades of research
T2  - MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - BackgroundThe growing importance of sustainability has led to the current literature being saturated with studies on the necessity of, and suggested topics for, education for sustainable health care (ESH). Even so, ESH implementation has been hindered by educator unpreparedness and resource scarcity. A potential resolution lies in virtual education. However, research on the strategies needed for successfully implementing virtual education in the context of sustainable health care and medical education is sparse; this study aims to fill the gap.MethodsTopic modelling, a computational text-mining method for analysing recurring patterns of co-occurring word clusters to reveal key topics prevalent across the texts, was used to examine how sustainability was addressed in research in medicine, medical education, and virtual education. A total of 17 631 studies, retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were analysed.ResultsSustainability-related topics within health care, medical education and virtual education provided systematic implications for Sustainable Virtual Medical Education (SVME)-ESH via virtual platforms in a sustainable way. Analyses of keywords, phrases, topics and their associated networks indicate that SVME should address the three pillars of environmental, social and economic sustainability and medical practices to uphold them; employ different technologies and methods including simulations, virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, distance learning; and implement strategies for collaborative development, persuasive diffusion and quality assurance.ConclusionsThis research suggests that sustainable strategies in virtual education for ESH require a systems approach, encompassing components such as learning content and objectives, evaluation, targeted learners, media, methods and strategies. The advancement of SVME necessitates that medical educators and researchers play a central and bridging role, guiding both the fields of sustainable health care and medical education in the development and implementation of SVME. In this way, they can prepare future physicians to address sustainability issues that impact patient care.

TI  - Enhancing mechanical performance of steel-tube-encased HSC composite walls: Experimental investigation and analytical modeling
T2  - STEEL AND COMPOSITE STRUCTURES
AB  - This paper discusses the study of concrete composite walls of algorithmic modeling, in which steel tubes are embedded. The load-bearing capacity of STHC composite walls increases with the increase of axial load coefficient, but its ductility decreases. The load-bearing capacity can be improved by increasing the strength of the steel pipes; however, the elasticity of STHC composite walls was found to be slightly reduced. As the shear stress coefficient increases, the load-bearing capacity of STHC composite walls decreases significantly, while the deformation resistance increases. By analyzing actual cases, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the research results in real situations and enhance the persuasiveness of the conclusions. The research results can provide a basis for future research, inspire more explorations on seismic design and construction, and further advance the development of this field. Emphasize the importance of research results, promote interdisciplinary cooperation in the fields of structural engineering, earthquake engineering, and materials science, and improve overall seismic resistance. The emphasis on these aspects will help highlight the practical impact of the research results, further strengthen the conclusions, and promote progress in the design and construction of earthquake-resistant structures. The goals of this work are access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, promotion of inclusive and sustainable urbanization and participation, implementation of sustainable and disaster-resilient architecture, sustainable planning and management of human settlements. Simulation results of linear and nonlinear structures show that this method can detect structural parameters and their changes due to damage and unknown disturbances. Therefore, it is believed that with the further development of fuzzy neural network artificial intelligence theory, this goal will be achieved in the near future.

TI  - Exploring factors influencing user perspective of ChatGPT as a technology that assists in healthcare decision making: A cross sectional survey study
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - As ChatGPT emerges as a potential ally in healthcare decision-making, it is imperative to investigate how users leverage and perceive it. The repurposing of technology is innovative but brings risks, especially since AI's effectiveness depends on the data it's fed. In healthcare, ChatGPT might provide sound advice based on current medical knowledge, which could turn into misinformation if its data sources later include erroneous information. Our study assesses user perceptions of ChatGPT, particularly of those who used ChatGPT for healthcare-related queries. By examining factors such as competence, reliability, transparency, trustworthiness, security, and persuasiveness of ChatGPT, the research aimed to understand how users rely on ChatGPT for health-related decision-making. A web-based survey was distributed to U.S. adults using ChatGPT at least once a month. Bayesian Linear Regression was used to understand how much ChatGPT aids in informed decision-making. This analysis was conducted on subsets of respondents, both those who used ChatGPT for healthcare decisions and those who did not. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were analyzed using content analysis, with thematic coding to extract public opinions on urban environmental policies. Six hundred and seven individuals responded to the survey. Respondents were distributed across 306 US cities of which 20 participants were from rural cities. Of all the respondents, 44 used ChatGPT for health-related queries and decision-making. In the healthcare context, the most effective model highlights 'Competent + Trustworthy + ChatGPT for healthcare queries', underscoring the critical importance of perceived competence and trustworthiness specifically in the realm of healthcare applications of ChatGPT. On the other hand, the non-healthcare context reveals a broader spectrum of influential factors in its best model, which includes 'Trustworthy + Secure + Benefits outweigh risks + Satisfaction + Willing to take decisions + Intent to use + Persuasive'. In conclusion our study findings suggest a clear demarcation in user expectations and requirements from AI systems based on the context of their use. We advocate for a balanced approach where technological advancement and user readiness are harmonized.

TI  - Improving Students' Argumentation Skills Using Dynamic Machine-Learning-Based Modeling
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB  - Argumentation is an omnipresent rudiment of daily communication and thinking. The ability to form convincing arguments is not only fundamental to persuading an audience of novel ideas but also plays a major role in strategic decision making, negotiation, and constructive, civil discourse. However, humans often struggle to develop argumentation skills, owing to a lack of individual and instant feedback in their learning process, because providing feedback on the individual argumentation skills of learners is timeconsuming and not scalable if conducted manually by educators. Grounding our research in social cognitive theory, we investigate whether dynamic technology -mediated argumentation modeling improves students' argumentation skills in the short and long term. To do so, we built a dynamic machine -learning (ML)-based modeling system. The system provides learners with dynamic writing feedback opportunities based on logical argumentation errors irrespective of instructor, time, and location. We conducted three empirical studies to test whether dynamic modeling improves persuasive writing performance more so than the benchmarks of scripted argumentation modeling (H1) and adaptive support (H2). Moreover, we assess whether, compared with adaptive support, dynamic argumentation modeling leads to better persuasive writing performance on both complex and simple tasks (H3). Finally, we investigate whether dynamic modeling on repeated argumentation tasks (over three months) leads to better learning in comparison with static modeling and no modeling (H4). Our results show that dynamic behavioral modeling significantly improves learners' objective argumentation skills across domains, outperforming established methods like scripted modeling, adaptive support, and static modeling. The results further indicate that, compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower and higher expertise alike. This work provides important empirical findings related to the effects of dynamic modeling and social cognitive theory that inform the design of writing and skill support systems for education. This paper demonstrates that social cognitive theory and dynamic modeling based on ML generalize outside of math and science domains to argumentative writing.

TI  - CoArgue: Fostering Lurkers' Contribution to Collective Arguments in Community-based QA Platforms
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2023 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS, CHI 2023
CP  - CHI conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI)
AB  - In Community-Based Question Answering (CQA) platforms, people can participate in discussions about non-factoid topics by marking their stances, providing premises, or arguing for the opinions they support, which forms "collective arguments". The sustainable development of collective arguments relies on a big contributor base, yet most of the frequent CQA users are lurkers who seldom speak out. With a formative study, we identified detailed obstacles preventing lurkers from contributing to collective arguments. We consequently designed a processing pipeline for extracting and summarizing augmentative elements from question threads. Based on this we built CoArgue, a tool with navigation and chatbot features to support CQA lurkers' motivation and ability in making contributions. Through a within-subject study (N=24), we found that, compared to a Quora-like baseline, participants perceived CoArgue as significantly more useful in enhancing their motivation and ability to join collective arguments and found the experience to be more engaging and productive.

TI  - Psychological, economic, and ethical factors in human feedback for a chatbot-based smoking cessation intervention
T2  - NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB  - Integrating human support with chatbot-based behavior change interventions raises three challenges: (1) attuning the support to an individual's state (e.g., motivation) for enhanced engagement, (2) limiting the use of the concerning human resources for enhanced efficiency, and (3) optimizing outcomes on ethical aspects (e.g., fairness). Therefore, we conducted a study in which 679 smokers and vapers had a 20% chance of receiving human feedback between five chatbot sessions. We find that having received feedback increases retention and effort spent on preparatory activities. However, analyzing a reinforcement learning (RL) model fit on the data shows there are also states where not providing feedback is better. Even this "standard" benefit-maximizing RL model is value-laden. It not only prioritizes people who would benefit most, but also those who are already doing well and want feedback. We show how four other ethical principles can be incorporated to favor other smoker subgroups, yet, interdependencies exist.

TI  - ProHealth eCoach: user-centered design and development of an eCoach app to promote healthy lifestyle with personalized activity recommendations
T2  - BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH
AB  - Background Regular physical activity (PA), healthy habits, and an appropriate diet are recommended guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process. Methods We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user's context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals. Results The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user's requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the "Google Material Design" guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users. Conclusions The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU).

TI  - Framing photos in the digital dark age: towards a socio-technological 'ecology of images'
T2  - APPLICATIONS OF DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING XLIV
CP  - Conference Applications of Digital Image Processing XLIV
AB  - The binary question of photography as science or art has been raging since Daguerre invented silver halide photography in 1839. Never has this controversy been more crucial, or been raised to such a fever pitch as in today's socio-technological world, in which uncertain images are consumed like candy and the evidentiary status of photographs is precarious at best. The 'offline' society of last century is behind us, where a philosopher like Sontag could confidently state that "a photograph passes for incontrovertible proof that something exists, or did exist, which is like what's in the picture" [1]. The 'ecology of images' of which she spoke is urgently needed now if we are to establish a framework within which the daily onslaught of uncertain imagery can be understood, the invidious action of image-based partisan persuasion can be combatted, pioneering achievements in image artistry can be celebrated, and a reliable photographic record of our current and future real world can be preserved.
   We may be better positioned now than at any time in the past to attempt such a task. Imaging technologies (ubiquitous digital photography, sophisticated camera sensors, image editing, synthetic image generation) have brought to fruition the use of photographic images to expand into a wide range of 'ecological' niches with varying impacts on individuals and societies. Other technologies (physiological signal processing, artificial intelligence), provide us with the means to gain insight into human perspectives and conscious/subliminal perceptions of these images. The contexts that apply to image distribution (digital platforms, social engineering, governmental regulation, communities of interest, commercial interests) are daily news. Early attempts to address image integrity (authenticity initiatives, fact-checking organisations) highlight the desire of humans to illuminate the age in which we find ourselves, a 'digital dark ages' [2] of eroding authenticity of our traditional knowledge artefacts.
   Drawing together reflections on the role of images in our century as well as a range of investigations over several years into aspects of the human-image nexus, we outline some of the technological and social features of a potential 'ecology of images' that may help shine light on the panoply of images of our times.

TI  - Improving logical flow in English-as-a-foreign-language learner essays by reordering sentences
T2  - ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
AB  - Argumentation is ubiquitous in everyday discourse, and it is a skill that can be learned. In our society, it is also one that must be learned: education systems all over the world agree on the importance of argumentation skills. However, writing effective argumentation is difficult, and even more so if it has to be expressed in a foreign language. Existing artificial intelligence systems for language learning can help learners: they can provide objective feedback (e.g., concerning grammar and spelling), as well as providing learners with opportunities to identify errors and subsequently improve their texts. Even so, systems aiming at higher discourse-level skills, such as persuasiveness and content organisation, are still limited. In this article, we propose the novel task of sentence reordering for improving the logical flow of argumentative essays. To train such a computational system, we present a new corpus called ICNALE-AS2R, containing essays written by English-as -foreign-language learners from various Asian countries, that have been annotated with argumentative structure and sentence reordering. We also propose a novel method to automatically reorder sentences in imperfect essays, which is based on argumentative structure analysis. Given an input essay and its corresponding argumentative structure, we cast the reordering task as a traversal problem. Our sentence reordering system first determines the pairwise ordering relation between pairs of sentences that are connected by argumentative relations. In the second step, the system traverses the argumentative structure that has been augmented with pairwise ordering information, in order to generate the final output text. Empirical evaluation shows that in the task of reconstructing the final reordered essays in the dataset, our reordering system achieves .926 and .879 in longest common subsequence ratio and Kendall's Tau metrics, respectively. The system is also able to perform the reordering operation selectively, that is, it reorders sentences when necessary and retains the original input order when it is already optimal.(c) 2023 The Author(s).

TI  - A Research Roadmap: Connected Health as an Enabler of Cancer Patient Support
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - The evidence that quality of life is a positive variable for the survival of cancer patients has prompted the interest of the health and pharmaceutical industry in considering that variable as a final clinical outcome. Sustained improvements in cancer care in recent years have resulted in increased numbers of people living with and beyond cancer, with increased attention being placed on improving quality of life for those individuals. Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. This paper provides an overview of important areas for the foundations of the creation of a new Connected Health paradigm in cancer care. Here we discuss the capabilities of mobile and wearable technologies; we also discuss pervasive and persuasive strategies and device systems to provide multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches for cancer patients for mental well-being, physical activity promotion, and rehabilitation. Several examples already show that there is enthusiasm in strengthening the possibilities offered by Connected Health in persuasive and pervasive technology in cancer care. Developments harnessing the Internet of Things, personalization, patient-centered design, and artificial intelligence help to monitor and assess the health status of cancer patients. Furthermore, this paper analyses the data infrastructure ecosystem for Connected Health and its semantic interoperability with the Connected Health economy ecosystem and its associated barriers. Interoperability is essential when developing Connected Health solutions that integrate with health systems and electronic health records. Given the exponential business growth of the Connected Health economy, there is an urgent need to develop mHealth (mobile health) exponentially, making it both an attractive and challenging market. In conclusion, there is a need for user-centered and multidisciplinary standards of practice to the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of Connected Health interventions in cancer care to ensure their acceptability, practicality, feasibility, effectiveness, affordability, safety, and equity.

TI  - The University as an Augmentation of Aesthetic Experience: In Defense of the Printed Book
T2  - TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB  - The article discusses the difficult question of whether the Book will lose its significance in the era of universal digitalization and artificial intelligence. The article considers the prospects for interpreting the Book as a special material entity responsible for establishing social ties within the university community, in the logic of object-oriented ontology. Being a visual - victorious - cultural and material form of Modernism, the Book has long been in the status of a truly authorial principle and embodied the very spirit of the Enlightenment and freedom of one's own inalienable statement. The Book has always been on the side of positive social forces. The question that remains open in the era of media, social networks and digital gadgets: will the Book be able to retain the place in the institutional breakdown of the social field, which it held quite firmly and for quite a long time? The article presents the central conceptually loaded concepts in a single discursive context, reflecting the choice of a common thematic horizon - "University", "university community", "aesthetic experience", "library/ Book". As a result, we come to the following conclusions: 1) Methodologically, the concept of the University (university community) can be conceptualized in the same way as social and cultural anthropology in general, no matter what it addresses. 2) Already in this formulation of the question, one of the constitutive concepts, largely fulfilling the function of the supporting structure, is designated - the concept of "community". The article shows that it is worth taking into account the material component of those partly ethnomethodological, partly habitual dispositions and the corresponding theoretical optics. It is in them that the "university community" expresses itself in the expected way as a collective identity. Removing the "natural attitude" and making the Book a mandatory condition for the existence of a horizontal network structure in the person of the university community, we gain additional access to the codification of the codes of the habitual order (P. Bourdieu). They are associated with the features of the organization, functioning, "capitalization" and the final institutionalization of this community. By exploring horizontal network structures of any level and degree of generality, we can return to them that focus of aesthetically presented authenticity and persuasiveness that is often lost in the abstract mode of thinking that is familiar to philosophy.

TI  - Can biased search results change people's opinions about anything at all? a close replication of the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME)
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - In previous experiments we have conducted on the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), we have focused on the ability of biased search results to shift voting preferences. In three new experiments with a total of 1,137 US residents (mean age = 33.2), we sought to determine whether biased search rankings could shift people's opinions on topics that do not involve candidates or elections. Each of the new experiments looked at a different topic, and participants were pre-screened to make sure they didn't have strong opinions about these topics. The topics were: Is artificial intelligence useful or dangerous? Is fracking helpful or dangerous? And: Are people born gay or do they choose to be gay? All participants were first asked various demographic questions, then shown brief summaries of the "pro" and "anti" views on each topic, and then asked their opinions about each topic. Next, participants were allowed to conduct an online search using our mock search engine (Kadoodle) lasting up to 15 minutes. In each experiment, one-third of the participants saw biased search results favoring one perspective; one-third saw biased search results favoring the opposing perspective; and one-third (the control group) saw mixed search results. After completing their search, participants were again asked for their opinions about the topic. Our primary dependent variable was Manipulation Power (MP), the percentage increase in the number of participants favoring one viewpoint after having viewed search rankings favoring that viewpoint. The MPs in the three experiments were 25.0%, 30.9%, and 17.8%, respectively. Corresponding shifts were also found for how persuasive participants found each viewpoint to be and for how much they trusted each viewpoint. We conclude that search rankings favoring one viewpoint on a wide range of topics might be able to cause people who have not yet formulated a strong opinion on such topics to adopt the favored perspective. If our findings prove to be robust, we are exposing what might be considered an unforeseen consequence of the creation of search engines, namely that even without human interference, search algorithms will inevitably alter the thinking and behavior of billions of people worldwide on perhaps any topic for which they have not yet formed strong opinions.

TI  - An improved artificial fish swarm algorithm optimized by particle swarm optimization algorithm with extended memory
T2  - KYBERNETES
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem that the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has a low success rate when applied to the optimization of multidimensional and multi-extreme value functions, the authors would introduce the extended memory factor to the PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the paper aims to improve the convergence rate and precision of basic artificial fish swarm algorithm (FSA), a novel FSA optimized by PSO algorithm with extended memory (PSOEM-FSA) is proposed.
   Design/methodology/approach - In PSOEM-FSA, the extended memory for PSO is introduced to store each particle' historical information comprising of recent places, personal best positions and global best positions, and a parameter called extended memory effective factor is employed to describe the importance of extended memory. Then, stability region of its deterministic version in a dynamic environment is analyzed by means of the classic discrete control theory. Furthermore, the extended memory factor is applied to five kinds of behavior pattern for FSA, including swarming, following, remembering, communicating and searching.
   Findings - The paper proposes a new intelligent algorithm. On the one hand, this algorithm makes the fish swimming have the characteristics of the speed of inertia; on the other hand, it expands behavior patterns for the fish to choose in the search process and achieves higher accuracy and convergence rate than PSO-FSA, owning to extended memory beneficial to direction and purpose during search. Simulation results verify that these improvements can reduce the blindness of fish search process, improve optimization performance of the algorithm.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack persuasion. In the future study, the authors will conduct more experiments to understand the behavior of PSOEM-FSA. In addition, there are mainly two aspects that the performance of this algorithm could be further improved.
   Practical implications - The proposed algorithm can be used to many practical engineering problems such as tracking problems.
   Social implications - The authors hope that the PSOEM-FSA can increase a branch of FSA algorithm, and enrich the content of the intelligent algorithms to some extent.
   Originality/value - The novel optimized FSA algorithm proposed in this paper improves the convergence speed and searching precision of the ordinary FSA to some degree.

TI  - Predicting Decisions in Language Based Persuasion Games
T2  - JOURNAL OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE RESEARCH
AB  - Sender-receiver interactions, and specifically persuasion games, are widely researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence, and serve as a solid foundation for powerful applications. However, in the classic persuasion games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the decision-maker are abstract or well-structured application-specific signals rather than natural (human) language messages, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion setups. This paper addresses the use of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact on the decisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the prediction of these decisions.
   For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several scored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert, and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the review score distribution available to the expert only. The expert's payoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker chooses the hotel. We also compare the behavioral patterns in this experiment to the equivalent patterns in similar experiments where the communication is based on the numerical values of the reviews rather than the reviews' text, and observe substantial differences which can be explained through an equilibrium analysis of the game.
   We consider a number of modeling approaches for our verbal communication setup, differing from each other in the model type (deep neural network (DNN) vs. linear classifier), the type of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the source of the textual features (DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a sequential modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied. Further analysis of the hand-crafted textual features allows us to make initial observations about the aspects of text that drive decision making in our setup.(1)

TI  - Utilizing the Fediverse and AI-bots for Youth Engagement During COVID-19 in a Hybrid Preventative Intervention
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 57TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
CP  - 57th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
AB  - Social media is a pervasive platform for delivering targeted interventions, albeit with cautionary ethical consequences. Recently AI robots or "bots" have been combined with social media platforms to enhance interaction, and enact behavior change through increased engagement and adherence to intervention protocols. This paper presents a customized social media platform for promoting engagement and adherence to a prevention intervention protocol. The protocol was originally developed in a group workshop format, and then online during COVID-19. A social media platform was utilized to connect group participants and deliver protocol activities. Bots encouraged participation via positive reinforcement mechanism for the entire group, and to remind a participant of protocol activities. While not a formal study, our exploratory results demonstrate that bots and a social media context support a group leader in increased engagement and adherence to the protocol. Our principal contribution in this paper is demonstrating that a personalized, adaptive instance of a Control Systems Engineering model may improve engagement-related outcomes in brief protocols.

TI  - Understanding Preconception Women's Needs and Preferences for Digital Health Resources: Qualitative Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Improving preconception health can benefit all women, their children, and their families regardless of their individual pregnancy intentions. Rapidly increasing access to information technology and online engagement have created opportunities to use digital health resources to engage with preconception women regarding lifestyle behaviors.
   Objective: This study explores how preconception women engage with digital health resources and online platforms to inform the design and development of a digital health resource to support women to make positive behavior change for their preconception health.
   Methods: This codesign research followed the Double Diamond process, which focuses on contextualization and explorative processes in phase 1 and ideation and development processes in phase 2. Phase 1 is reported on in this study and was undertaken via a series of 1-on-1 in-depth interviews with female participants (N=12) aged 18-45 years over 3 months. Interviews were designed to explore participants' lived experiences in relation to their health and desired supports for healthy lifestyle behaviors. The first interview focused on participants' perceptions of health and health behaviors, the second interview focused on social connections for health, and the third interview focused on digital health information and supports. Conversations from the first interview informed the development of the second interview, and conversations from the second interview informed the development of the third interview. Community advisors (N=8) met to provide feedback and advice to the researchers throughout the interview process. Qualitative analyses of transcripts from interviews were undertaken by 2 researchers before a deductive process identified themes mapped to the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) framework.
   Results: In total, 9 themes and 8 subthemes were identified from 124 codes. In relation to digital health resources, specifically, participants were already engaging with a range of digital health resources and had high expectations of these. Digital health resources needed to be easy to access, make women's busy lives easier, be evidence based, and be reputable. Social connectedness was also highly important to our participants, with information and advice from peers with similar experiences being preferred over yet more online health information. Online communities facilitated these social interactions. Participants were open to the idea of chatbots and virtual assistants but acknowledged that they would not replace authentic social interactions.
   Conclusions: Codesigned digital health resources should be evidence based, reputable, and easy to access. Social connections were considered highly important to women, and designers of digital health resources should consider how they can increase opportunities for women to connect and learn from each other to promote health behaviors.

TI  - Context-Aware Chatbot Based on Cyber-Physical Sensing for Promoting Serendipitous Face-to-Face Communication
T2  - PERSUASIVE TECHNOLOGY (PERSUASIVE 2022)
CP  - 17th International Conference on Persuasive Technology (PERSUASIVE)
AB  - To promote the face-to-face communication reduced by COVID-19, we proposed and implemented a context-aware Slack chat-bot based on Cyber-Physical sensing that helps colleagues meet more often in the same place. Our system periodically collects the user's internal context through Slack (cyber sensing) and uses small BLE beacons distributed to colleagues and beacon scanners installed in a laboratory to sense physical attendance (physical sensing). In addition, the system notifies the user of recommended actions, such as lunch or coffee break, depending on the context determined by the Cyber-Physical sensors. We deployed the proposed system in a laboratory environment and conducted an initial experiment for six weeks. Experimental results confirmed that our system can encourage serendipitous face-to-face communication during periods when the frequency of attending school and going to work dropped due to COVID-19. It was also found that in an environment such as a laboratory, where a certain level of trust has already been established, the openness of the collected information can further motivate users to participate in the system.

TI  - Machine Learning Methods to Personalize Persuasive Strategiesin mHealth Interventions That Promote Physical Activity:ScopingReview and Categorization Overview
T2  - JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Although physical activity (PA) has positive effects on health and well-being, physical inactivity is a worldwideproblem. Mobile health interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting PA. Personalizing persuasive strategiesimproves intervention success and can be conducted using machine learning (ML). For PA, several studies have addressedpersonalized persuasive strategies without ML, whereas others have included personalization using ML without focusing onpersuasive strategies. An overview of studies discussing ML to personalize persuasive strategies in PA-promoting interventionsand corresponding categorizations could be helpful for such interventions to be designed in the future but is still missing. Objective: First, we aimed to provide an overview of implemented ML techniques to personalize persuasive strategies in mobilehealth interventions promoting PA. Moreover, we aimed to present a categorization overview as a starting point for applying MLtechniques in this field. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O'Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (PreferredReporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria. Scopus, Web of Science,and PubMed were searched for studies that included ML to personalize persuasive strategies in interventions promoting PA.Papers were screened using the ASReview software. From the included papers, categorized by the research project they belongedto, we extracted data regarding general study information, target group, PA intervention, implemented technology, and studydetails. On the basis of the analysis of these data, a categorization overview was given.Results: In total, 40 papers belonging to 27 different projects were included. These papers could be categorized in 4 groupsbased on their dimension of personalization. Then, for each dimension, 1 or 2 persuasive strategy categories were found togetherwith a type of ML. The overview resulted in a categorization consisting of 3 levels: dimension of personalization, persuasivestrategy, and type of ML. When personalizing the timing of the messages, most projects implemented reinforcement learning topersonalize the timing of reminders and supervised learning (SL) to personalize the timing of feedback, monitoring, and goal-settingmessages. Regarding the content of the messages, most projects implemented SL to personalize PA suggestions and feedback oreducational messages. For personalizing PA suggestions, SL can be implemented either alone or combined with a recommendersystem. Finally, reinforcement learning was mostly used to personalize the type of feedback messages. Conclusions: The overview of all implemented persuasive strategies and their corresponding ML methods is insightful for thisinterdisciplinary field. Moreover, it led to a categorization overview that provides insights into the design and development of personalized persuasive strategies to promote PA. In future papers, the categorization overview might be expanded with additionallayers to specify ML methods or additional dimensions of personalization and persuasive strategies.

TI  - The Complex Interaction Between Sleep-Related Information, Misinformation, and Sleep Health: Call for Comprehensive Research on Sleep Infodemiology and Infoveillance
T2  - JMIR INFODEMIOLOGY
AB  - The complex interplay between sleep-related information-both accurate and misleading-and its impact on clinical public health is an emerging area of concern. Lack of awareness of the importance of sleep, and inadequate information related to sleep, combined with misinformation about sleep, disseminated through social media, nonexpert advice, commercial interests, and other sources, can distort individuals' understanding of healthy sleep practices. Such misinformation can lead to the adoption of unhealthy sleep behaviors, reducing sleep quality and exacerbating sleep disorders. Simultaneously, poor sleep itself impairs critical cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These impairments can heighten individuals' vulnerability to misinformation, creating a vicious cycle that further entrenches poor sleep habits and unhealthy behaviors. Sleep deprivation is known to reduce the ability to critically evaluate information, increase suggestibility, and enhance emotional reactivity, making individuals more prone to accepting persuasive but inaccurate information. This cycle of misinformation and poor sleep creates a clinical public health issue that goes beyond individual well-being, influencing occupational performance, societal productivity, and even broader clinical public health decision-making. The effects are felt across various sectors, from health care systems burdened by sleep-related issues to workplaces impacted by decreased productivity due to sleep deficiencies. The need for comprehensive clinical public health initiatives to combat this cycle is critical. These efforts must promote sleep literacy, increase awareness of sleep's role in cognitive resilience, and correct widespread sleep myths. Digital tools and technologies, such as sleep-tracking devices and artificial intelligence-powered apps, can play a role in educating the public and enhancing the accessibility of accurate, evidence-based sleep information. However, these tools must be carefully designed to avoid the spread of misinformation through algorithmic biases. Furthermore, research into the cognitive impacts of sleep deprivation should be leveraged to develop strategies that enhance societal resilience against misinformation. Sleep infodemiology and infoveillance, which involve tracking and analyzing the distribution of sleep-related information across digital platforms, offer valuable methodologies for identifying and addressing the spread of misinformation in real time. Addressing this issue requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between sleep scientists, health care providers, educators, policy makers, and digital platform regulators. By promoting healthy sleep practices and debunking myths, it is possible to disrupt the feedback loop between poor sleep and misinformation, leading to improved individual health, better decision-making, and

TI  - Supporting Autonomous Motivation for Physical Activity With Chatbots During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Factorial Experiment
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Although physical activity can mitigate disease trajectories and improve and sustain mental health, many people have become less physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal information technology, such as activity trackers and chatbots, can technically converse with people and possibly enhance their autonomous motivation to engage in physical activity. The literature on behavior change techniques (BCTs) and self-determination theory (SDT) contains promising insights that can be leveraged in the design of these technologies; however, it remains unclear how this can be achieved.Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a chatbot system that improves the user's autonomous motivation for walking based on BCTs and SDT. First, we aimed to develop and evaluate various versions of a chatbot system based on promising BCTs. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of the system improves the autonomous motivation for walking and the associated factors of need satisfaction. Third, we explored the support for the theoretical mechanism and effectiveness of various BCT implementations.Methods: We developed a chatbot system using the mobile apps Telegram (Telegram Messenger Inc) and Google Fit (Google LLC). We implemented 12 versions of this system, which differed in 3 BCTs: goal setting, experimenting, and action planning. We then conducted a feasibility study with 102 participants who used this system over the course of 3 weeks, by conversing with a chatbot and completing questionnaires, capturing their perceived app support, need satisfaction, physical activity levels, and motivation.Results: The use of the chatbot systems was satisfactory, and on average, its users reported increases in autonomous motivation for walking. The dropout rate was low. Although approximately half of the participants indicated that they would have preferred to interact with a human instead of the chatbot, 46.1% (47/102) of the participants stated that the chatbot helped them become more active, and 42.2% (43/102) of the participants decided to continue using the chatbot for an additional week. Furthermore, the majority thought that a more advanced chatbot could be very helpful. The motivation was associated with the satisfaction of the needs of competence and autonomy, and need satisfaction, in turn, was associated with the perceived system support, providing support for SDT underpinnings. However, no substantial differences were found across different BCT implementations.Conclusions: The results provide evidence that chatbot systems are a feasible means to increase autonomous motivation for physical activity. We found support for SDT as a basis for the design, laying a foundation for larger studies to confirm the effectiveness of the selected BCTs within chatbot systems, explore a wider range of BCTs, and help the development of guidelines for the design of interactive technology that helps users achieve long-term health benefits.(JMIR Form Res 2023;7:e38500) doi: 10.2196/38500

TI  - Nonusage Attrition of Adolescents in an mHealth Promotion Intervention and the Role of Socioeconomic Status: Secondary Analysis of a 2-Arm Cluster-Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may help adolescents adopt healthy lifestyles. However, attrition in these interventions is high. Overall, there is a lack of research on nonusage attrition in adolescents, particularly regarding the role of socioeconomic status (SES).
   Objective: The aim of this study was to focus on the role of SES in the following three research questions (RQs): When do adolescents stop using an mHealth intervention (RQ1)? Why do they report nonusage attrition (RQ2)? Which intervention components (ie, self-regulation component, narrative, and chatbot) prevent nonusage attrition among adolescents (RQ3)?
   Methods: A total of 186 Flemish adolescents (aged 12-15 years) participated in a 12-week mHealth program. Log data were monitored to measure nonusage attrition and usage duration for the 3 intervention components. A web-based questionnaire was administered to assess reasons for attrition. A survival analysis was conducted to estimate the time to attrition and determine whether this differed according to SES (RQ1). Descriptive statistics were performed to map the attrition reasons, and Fisher exact tests were used to determine if these reasons differed depending on the educational track (RQ2). Mixed effects Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the associations between the use duration of the 3 components during the first week and attrition. An interaction term was added to the regression models to determine whether associations differed by the educational track (RQ3).
   Results: After 12 weeks, 95.7% (178/186) of the participants stopped using the app. 30.1% (56/186) of the adolescents only opened the app on the installation day, and 44.1% (82/186) stopped using the app in the first week. Attrition at any given time during the intervention period was higher for adolescents from the nonacademic educational track compared with those from the academic track. The other SES indicators (family affluence and perceived financial situation) did not explain attrition. The most common reasons for nonusage attrition among participants were perceiving that the app did not lead to behavior change, not liking the app, thinking that they already had a sufficiently healthy lifestyle, using other apps, and not being motivated by the environment. Attrition reasons did not differ depending on the educational track. More time spent in the self-regulation and narrative components during the first week was associated with lower attrition, whereas chatbot use duration was not associated with attrition rates. No moderating effects of SES were observed in the latter association.
   Conclusions: Nonusage attrition was high, especially among adolescents in the nonacademic educational track. The reported reasons for attrition were diverse, with no statistical differences according to the educational level. The duration of the use of the self-regulation and narrative components during the first week may prevent attrition for both educational tracks.

TI  - Information and communication technology-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases: A scoping review
T2  - SEMINARS IN ARTHRITIS AND RHEUMATISM
AB  - Objective: This review aimed to map the existing the information and communication technology (ICT)-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and identify key effectiveness factors and guidelines for professionals. Methods: A scoping review systematically reviewed PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE and Web of Science. We designed search strategies to identify ICT-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases focused on rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, published between January 2011 and October 2023. Data extraction was independently screened by two reviewers according to the eligibility criteria. Results: Of 13,861 records, 18 met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were randomized controlled trials, primarily conducted in the USA, focusing on rheumatoid arthritis. ICT-based interventions included web-based platforms, aiming to improve self-management, medication adherence, with most interventions showing significant improvements. Digital tools such as websites, chatbots were common. Five groups representing the ICT functions were identified: digital self-management tools, multimedia learning materials, personalized educational sessions, behavior change and empathy games, and interactive online communities and peer support. Most studies lacked theoretical frameworks, or guidelines for developing patient education. Conclusion: ICT-based patient education has significant potential for enhancing self-management and behavior changes in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases.

TI  - Problems that Can Occur when Assaying Extracts to Pure Compounds in Biological Systems
T2  - CURRENT THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH-CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL
AB  - A B S T R A C T For a significant number of years, scientists of many persuasions have assayed natural product materials ranging from crude extracts to pure compounds, in a multitude of assays causally related to some biological processes. However, in a very significant number of submitted papers and published articles, what may be considered as canned biological assays were used, and if a positive effect was observed, then the authors would claim that the material assayed was a potential drug lead. This also occurred with pure synthetic compounds and compounds derived from natural products by simple chemical modifications. However, what has now become quite obvious-with all such classes of materials-is that there are many promiscuous players with multiple bioactivities. These can range from relatively crude extracts, pure compounds from natural products, synthetic processes that produce natural product derivatives, and even compounds that are truly synthetic in origin. There is also a potential problem with the data from crude to purified extracts being used to claim some form of beneficial activities for such materials, to sell that particular mixture to the lay public, by very careful descriptions of its possible uses due to legal hurdles. With the advent of artificial intelligence and very large compound databases, some of which may well contain impure materials, scientists from a variety of backgrounds have begun to utilize such listings to obtain compounds for their low to high throughput biological screens, without realizing that there are very significant numbers of active compounds (eg, pan assay interference compounds and invalid metabolic panaceas), that will hit in many different screens for a variety of reasons, thus leading to significant wasted effort s and published scientific articles that have incorrect results. This commentary gives some of the history of such materials but is designed to be used as a warning to both researchers and in particular, journal editors, and reviewers, that reports of biological results that are claimed to be the result of the compounds used, need to be very carefully screened for results due to such promiscuous compounds, irrespective of their nominal source(s). All literature searches were made by the author and the background knowledge has come from more than 55 years of research in industry and governmental laboratories in both the United Kingdom and the United States, for enzyme inhibitors/activators as well as antimicrobial and antitumor lead compounds mainly from natural product sources. The conclusion that I came up with as a result is this: Caveat emptor. (Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2021; 82:XXX-XXX) 0 2021 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. 0 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Witnessing: iteration and social change
T2  - AI & SOCIETY
AB  - At first thought, iteration seems banal. It is about repeating the existing; nothing is changing. But this special issue shows that, in an era obsessed with the new, it is often the repetition of the old that creates social change. Iteration fosters persuasion. It affords opportunities for critical and creative engagement with meaning, values and knowledge. It invites collaboration, though its apparent simplicity often belies a tremendous amount of individual and collective labour involved in the practices of iteration. Through its repetition of the existing, however, iteration also can be a mechanism for reproducing the status quo. Its pervasiveness and banality naturalises power, and its mimetic qualities shrink spaces for critical distance and care. The editors of this special issue have brought together a delightful and fascinating diversity of articles focussed on iteration in cultural production in the digital age. We hop across geographies to examine lockdown diaries, artists' books, socialist memes, fake news, the design of social media platforms and artificial intelligence, activism, film, social media forum moderation, news website reader comments and more. Iterating through the collection as a whole, across its many disciplines, is a commitment to theorising through empirical evidence, to explaining with critique, and to providing pathways to praxis. These characteristics of this special issue, and the many concepts and arguments it puts forward, make this collection of work exceptionally rich material for seeing iteration and how it shapes the world we live in today, as well as the world we want it to be. In this preface, I take a media sociology approach to show how iteration can be usefully understood as collaborative communication for change. I see this understanding of iteration, whose ascendancy is related to the ascendancy of computer science, as baked into the form of communication technologies-and thus as shaping the kinds of iteration that are possible when we use these technologies. This understanding also prompts us to focus on the connection between iteration and social change. To explore how this works, I analytically slow down the practice of iteration to show that it is a communication practice of transmission. That transmission practice is itself constituted of cognate communication practices-the reception, evaluation and production of knowledge-in which visibility and persuasion are key. In the latter parts of the preface, I illustrate this through the example of witnessing as iteration, as the high-stakes nature of witnessing make it a canary in the coalmine, more generally, for mediated communication in the digital age. I show how breaking the witnessing practice down into its various parts allows us to see how power enters and inflects who and what are iterated, when-and who and what are not. Thinking critically with iteration and against unequal power relations, the praxis this preface suggests is one-much in line with the rest of this special issue-of explaining how iteration might move the grassroots towards their goals.

TI  - Can we serve both God and Money? The role of indirect appeal and its limitation
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - PurposeHarmonizing religion and economic pursuits is treacherous because mixing the two rarely resonate with consumers, often resulting consumers' greed perceptions. This paper aims to explore the antecedents and consequence of consumers' greed perceptions in the context of for-profit religious-affiliated companies (FPRCs) and how they can harmonize religious and commercial missions by using different ad types (direct vs indirect appeal). Design/methodology/approachThe authors conducted two experiments: Study 1 was an online experiment with participants from the USA collected through Amazon's Mechanical Turk (n = 410) to reveal the overall mechanism. Study 2 was a field experiment (n = 292) to corroborate Study 1's findings. The authors analyzed the data using a multigroup structural equation model. FindingsFirst, consumers perceive greed against FPRCs' dual identities incurred by their commercial activities. Second, when FPRCs obscure their religious identities by using third-party organizations (TPOs) as its promoter (i.e. indirect appeal), consumers' greed perceptions decline, but this does not increase consumers' future patronage intentions. Finally, in online and field experiments, consumers enhance their purchase intentions and behavior, respectively, under indirect appeal. Research limitations/implicationsFirst, further investigation of the cognitive dissonance mechanism when consumers face seemingly contradictory identities of organizations is crucial to identify bottlenecks in promoting FPRCs' commercial offerings. Second, examining boundary conditions of indirect appeal is important to enhance our understanding of FPRCs' advertising, such as consumers' awareness of TPOs' intentionality. Lastly, not every type of indirect appeal brings the same effects. Future studies may explore diverse forms of indirect appeal, such as using artificial intelligence-based algorithms without TPOs. Practical implicationsDespite heightened interest in supporting dual missions (i.e. purpose and profit), this study shows why doing well while doing good is inherently challenging in practice creating marketing liability. To deal with this, the present findings suggest that, first, rather than exposing an FPRC's religious (or communal) identity upfront, providing subtle cues through a TPO of its religious affiliation can be persuasive to win the hearts of target customers. Second, given the short-term effectiveness of indirect appeal, FPRCs need to use both direct and indirect appeal flexibly, as each type of ad delivers a distinctive advantage. Lastly, indirect appeal is particularly effective in offline promotional activities in the context of FPRCs. Originality/valueFirst, by meshing paradox theory, the authors show that dual identities of FPRCs expose them to a marketing liability that single-mission enterprises rarely face. Second, when FPRCs use indirect appeal, they face a tradeoff between mitigating greed perception and securing future patronage. Third, results from the online experiment and field experiment show when consumers' intention and actual behavior align.

TI  - The efficacy of online physical activity interventions with added mobile elements within adults aged 50 years and over: Randomized controlled trial
T2  - APPLIED PSYCHOLOGY-HEALTH AND WELL BEING
AB  - Electronic health (eHealth) and mobile health (mHealth) could stimulate physical activity (PA) in a time-efficient and cost-effective way. This randomized controlled trial aims to investigate effects on moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) of different combined computer- and mobile-based PA interventions targeted at adults aged 50 years and over. Participants (N = 954) were randomly allocated to a basic existing computer-based intervention (Active Plus [AP] or I Move [IM]) supplemented with one of three mobile elements being (1) activity tracker (AT), (2) ecological momentary intervention (EMI), or (3) chatbot (CB) or a control group (CG). MVPA was assessed via the SQUASH at baseline (T0), 3 months (T1), and 6 months (T2) and via accelerometers at T0 and T2. No intervention effects were found on objective (p = .502) and subjective (p = .368) MVPA for main research groups (AP/IM + AT, AP/IM + EMI, AP/IM + CB). Preliminary MVPA findings for subgroups (AP + AT, AP + EMI, AP + CB, IM + AT, IM + EMI, IM + CB) combined with drop-out data showed potential for the computer-based intervention AP with an integrated AT. Based on these preliminary findings, eHealth developers can be recommended to integrate ATs with existing computer-based PA interventions. However, further research is recommended to confirm the findings as a result of the exploratory nature of the subgroup analyses.

TI  - Smartphone-Delivered Ecological Momentary Interventions Based on Ecological Momentary Assessments to Promote Health Behaviors: Systematic Review and Adapted Checklist for Reporting Ecological Momentary Assessment and Intervention Studies
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Healthy behaviors are crucial for maintaining a person's health and well-being. The effects of health behavior interventions are mediated by individual and contextual factors that vary over time. Recently emerging smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) can use real-time user reports (ecological momentary assessments [EMAs]) to trigger appropriate support when needed in daily life. Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the characteristics of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs in relation to their effects on health behaviors, user engagement, and user perspectives. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL in June 2019 and updated the search in March 2020. We included experimental studies that incorporated EMIs based on EMAs delivered through smartphone apps to promote health behaviors in any health domain. Studies were independently screened. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. We performed a narrative synthesis of intervention effects, user perspectives and engagement, and intervention design and characteristics. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included studies. Results: We included 19 papers describing 17 unique studies and comprising 652 participants. Most studies were quasi-experimental (13/17, 76%), had small sample sizes, and great heterogeneity in intervention designs and measurements. EMIs were most popular in the mental health domain (8/17, 47%), followed by substance abuse (3/17, 18%), diet, weight loss, physical activity (4/17, 24%), and smoking (2/17, 12%). Of the 17 studies, the 4 (24%) included randomized controlled trials reported nonstatistically significant effects on health behaviors, and 4 (24%) quasi-experimental studies reported statistically significant pre-post improvements in self-reported primary outcomes, namely depressive (P<.001) and psychotic symptoms (P=.03), drinking frequency (P<.001), and eating patterns (P=.01). EMA was commonly used to capture subjective experiences as well as behaviors, whereas sensors were rarely used. Generally, users perceived EMIs to be helpful. Common suggestions for improvement included enhancing personalization, multimedia and interactive capabilities (eg, voice recording), and lowering the EMA reporting burden. EMI and EMA components were rarely reported and were not described in a standardized manner across studies, hampering progress in this field. A reporting checklist was developed to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of findings and enhance the transparency and replicability of future studies using EMAs and EMIs. Conclusions: The use of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs to promote behavior change is an emerging area of research, with few studies evaluating efficacy. Such interventions could present an opportunity to enhance health but need further assessment in larger participant cohorts and well-designed evaluations following reporting checklists. Future research should explore combining self-reported EMAs of subjective experiences with objective data passively collected via sensors to promote personalization while minimizing user burden, as well as explore different EMA data collection methods (eg, chatbots).

TI  - Digital Health Education for the Future: The SaNuRN (Santé Numérique Rouen-Nice) Consortium's Journey
T2  - JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION
AB  - Sant & eacute; Num & eacute;rique Rouen -Nice (SaNuRN; "Digital Health Rouen -Nice" in English) is a 5 -year project by the University of Rouen Normandy (URN) and C & ocirc;te d'Azur University (CAU) consortium to optimize digital health education for medical and paramedical students, professionals, and administrators. The project includes a skills framework, training modules, and teaching resources. In 2027, SaNuRN is expected to train a significant portion of the 400,000 health and paramedical students at the French national level. Our purpose is to give a synopsis of the SaNuRN initiative, emphasizing its novel educational methods and how they will enhance the delivery of digital health education. Our goals include showcasing SaNuRN as a comprehensive program consisting of a proficiency framework, instructional modules, and educational materials and explaining how SaNuRN is implemented in the participating academic institutions. SaNuRN is aimed at educating and training health and paramedical students in digital health. The project is a cooperative effort between URN and CAU, covering 4 French departments. It is based on the French National Referential on Digital Health ( FNRDH ), which defines the skills and competencies to be acquired and validated by every student in the health, paramedical, and social professions curricula. The SaNuRN team is currently adapting the existing URN and CAU syllabi to FNRDH and developing short -duration video capsules of 20-30 minutes to teach all the relevant material. The project aims to ensure that the largest student population earns the necessary skills, and it has developed a 2 -tier system involving facilitators who will enable the efficient expansion of the project's educational outreach and support the students in learning the needed material efficiently. With a focus on real -world scenarios and innovative teaching activities integrating telemedicine devices and virtual professionals, SaNuRN is committed to enabling continuous learning for health care professionals in clinical practice. The SaNuRN team introduced new ways of evaluating health care professionals by shifting from a knowledge -based to a competencies -based evaluation, aligning with the Miller teaching pyramid and using the Objective Structured Clinical Examination and Script Concordance Test in digital health education. Drawing on the expertise of URN, CAU, and their public health and digital research laboratories and partners, SaNuRN represents a platform for continuous innovation, including telemedicine training and living labs with virtual and interactive professional activities. SaNuRN provides a comprehensive, personalized, 30 -hour training package for health and paramedical students, addressing all 70 FNRDH competencies. The project is enhanced using artificial intelligence and natural language processing to create virtual patients and professionals for digital health care simulation. SaNuRN teaching materials are open access. It collaborates with academic institutions worldwide to develop educational material on digital health in English and multilingual formats. SaNuRN offers a practical and persuasive training approach to meet the current digital health education requirements.

TI  - Predicting healthcare-seeking behavior based on stated readiness to act: development and validation of a prediction model
T2  - TRANSLATIONAL BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE
AB  - A starting point of many digital health interventions informed by the Stages of Change Model of behavior change is assessing a person's readiness to change. In this paper, we use the concept of readiness to develop and validate a prediction model of health-seeking behavior in the context of family planning. We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected, anonymized health data submitted by 4,088 female users of a free health chatbot in Kenya. We developed a prediction model of (future) self-reported action by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets (80/20, stratified by the outcome). We further split the training data into 10 folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step in model selection. We fit nine different classification models and selected the model that maximized the area under the receiver operator curve. We then fit the selected model to the full training dataset and evaluated the performance of this model on the holdout test data. The model predicted who will visit a family planning provider in the future with high precision (0.93) and moderate recall (0.75). Using the Stages of Change framework, we concluded that 29% of women were in the "Preparation" stage, 21% were in the "Contemplation" stage, and 50% were in the "Pre-Contemplation" stage. We demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict future healthcare-seeking behavior based on information learned during the initial encounter. Models like this may help intervention developers to tailor strategies and content in real-time.

TI  - A Diabetes Education App for People Living With Type 2 Diabetes: Co-Design Study
T2  - JMIR FORMATIVE RESEARCH
AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing global health concern, including in Singapore. Diabetes education programs have been shown to be effective in improving health outcomes and diabetes self-management skills. Mobile health apps have emerged as useful tools for diabetes education; however, their use and acceptance by the target population remain inconsistent. Therefore, end-user participation in the design and development of a mobile health app is crucial for designing an acceptable app that can improve outcomes for populations with a chronic disease.Objective: The objective of this study was to apply an end-user participatory approach to co-design a diabetes education app prototype for people living with T2D by exploring their perceptions, acceptance, and usability of an app prototype, as well as their diabetes experience and perspectives on digital diabetes education. Methods: A total of 8 people with T2D, who were recruited from diabetes management Facebook groups, participated in 4 web-based surveys via Qualtrics and 2 structured interviews via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) between August 20, 2021, and January 28, 2022. Descriptive statistics and thematic analyses of the discussion and iterative feedback on the app prototype were used to assess the participants' perceptions of living with T2D, attitudes toward digital diabetes education, and acceptance of the prototype. Results: Analyses of the surveys and interview data revealed 3 themes: challenges of living with T2D; validation, acceptability, and usability of the diabetes education app prototype; and perspectives on digital diabetes education. In the first theme, participants highlighted the importance of solitary accountability, translating knowledge into practice, and developing pragmatic self-consciousness. The second theme indicated that the diabetes education app prototype was acceptable, with information and appearance being key; revealed ambivalent and polarized opinions toward the chatbot; and confirmed potential impact of the app on diabetes self-management skills and practice. The third theme comprised the necessity of using a variety of information-seeking strategies and recommendations for desired content and app qualities, including accessibility, adaptability, autonomy, evidence-based design and content, gamification, guidance, integration, personalization, and up-to-date content. The findings were used to reiterate the app design.Conclusions: Despite a small sample size, the study demonstrated the feasibility of engaging and empowering people living with T2D to consider digital therapeutics for diabetes self-management skills and practice. Participants gave rather positive feedback on the design and content of the app prototype, with some recommendations for improvements. The findings suggest that incorporating end-user feedback into app design can lead to the creation of feasible and acceptable tools for diabetes education, potentially improving outcomes for populations with a chronic disease. Further research is needed to test the impact of the refined diabetes education app prototype on diabetes self-management skills and practice and quality of life.

TI  - The Effect of a mHealth App (KENPO-app) for Specific Health Guidance on Weight Changes in Adults With Obesity and Hypertension: Pilot Randomized Controlled Trial
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Commercial smartphone apps that promote self-monitoring of weight loss are widely available. The development of disease-specific apps has begun, but there is no app for specific health guidance (SHG) to prevent metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged adults in Japan.Objective: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of an SHG mobile health app in facilitating weight loss in Japanese adults with obesity and hypertension.Methods: In a 12-week, statistician-blinded, randomized parallel controlled trial, 78 overweight and obese men aged 40-69 years were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the usual support plus KENPO-app group (intervention group) or the active control group. KENPO-app (release April 10, 2019; OMRON Healthcare Co., Ltd.) was developed by the study team and focus groups and uses behavior change techniques (ie, self-monitoring and goal-setting theory). This app was developed for SHG based on the four specific health checkups and guidance system in Japan: (1) focusing primarily on achieving the target (weight loss of >= 2 kg); (2) assessing healthy eating, exercise habits, smoking habits, relaxation, and self-weighing; (3) providing information on the results of specific health checkups; and (4) starting an intervention period of 6 months with the interim assessment at 3 months. The initial assessment explored the following: personality traits (4 types), health checkup data concerns (10 items), symptom concerns (10 items), and the aim of the intervention (weight loss, improving fitness, symptoms, laboratory data). Chatbot-supported health information on health and health behavior was selected from 392 quizzes based on app data and was provided to participants. The KENPO-app had chatbot-supported feedback and information provision combined with a self-monitoring tool (weight, steps, and blood pressure). Data on active exercise, healthy eating, and healthy lifestyle habits were obtained using a web-based self-administered questionnaire at baseline and 12 weeks.Results: The trial's retention rate was 95% (74/78). The adherence to daily self-weighing, wearing the pedometer, and blood pressure monitoring in the KENPO-app group was significantly higher than those in the active control group. Compared with the active control group, the median body weight and BMI of the intervention group significantly decreased at 3 months (-0.4, IQR -2.0 to 0.6 kg vs -1.1, IQR -2.7 to -0.5 kg; P=.03; -0.1, IQR -0.6 to 0.3 kg vs -0.4, IQR -0.8 to -0.2 kg; P=.02, respectively). The intervention increased the percentage of participants who self-reported taking >= 8000 steps, eating vegetables before rice, eating slowly, and relaxing. Personality traits were associated with the degree of weight loss in the intervention group. Conclusions: The SHG-specific KENPO-app was feasible and induced modest but significant weight loss in adults with obesity.

TI  - Digital nudge persuasiveness of avatars in restaurants toward healthy choices and happy diners
T2  - TOURISM REVIEW
AB  - PurposeAmid rising concerns over unhealthy dietary habits and their impact on public health, this study aims to explore the role of avatars in promoting healthier eating and enhancing customer satisfaction in restaurants. By leveraging the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and nudge theory, this research sought to gain insights into consumer behavior and assess how digital innovations can encourage healthier food choices.Design/methodology/approachThis study recruited 672 participants in the USA. Participants viewed a video featuring an avatar that informed them about available healthy food options, simulating a restaurant ordering scenario. Following the video, participants completed comprehensive online surveys. The collected data was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling to assess the effectiveness and implications of the intervention.FindingsThe findings revealed that health consciousness, environmental awareness, social norms and perceived behavioral control significantly influence dietary habits. Restaurant health initiatives and avatar persuasiveness were found to encourage healthier food choices, improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and enhance electronic word-of-mouth.

TI  - Is being human-like beneficial? The effect of anthropomorphism on chatbot persuasion in e-commerce
T2  - INTERNET RESEARCH
AB  - Purpose Chatbots are vital for enhancing e-commerce sustainability by providing efficient customer support. Although previous studies have considered both linguistic and visual anthropomorphism as crucial factors in e-commerce chatbot design, their joint effects and their underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on insights from the literature on anthropomorphism and the elaboration likelihood model, this research attempts to examine the joint effects of the two types of anthropomorphism, the boundary condition, and the subsequent impact on purchase intention.Design/methodology/approach A research model was proposed and empirically tested using two laboratory-controlled experimental studies.Findings Linguistic anthropomorphism plays a dominant role over visual anthropomorphism in influencing social presence and communicative effectiveness. In addition, linguistic anthropomorphism harms persuasion through the mediating role of communicative effectiveness, and the fit between linguistic and visual anthropomorphism amplifies the negative effect on purchase intention. Moreover, shopping motivation serves as a boundary condition for the negative effect of anthropomorphism.Practical implications Chatbot designers should be cautious when using anthropomorphism in e-commerce chatbot design. The use of machine-like languages may be more persuasive than that of human-like languages, especially for utilitarian products. Notably, mismatched anthropomorphic elements may harm user experience.Originality/value This study enriches chatbot literature by examining the role of chatbot anthropomorphism in the e-commerce context. Moreover, this study provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding how chatbots' linguistic and visual anthropomorphism jointly influence consumer behavior.

TI  - Opening the digital doorway to sexual healthcare: Recommendations from a behaviour change wheel analysis of barriers and facilitators to seeking online sexual health information and support among underserved populations
T2  - PLOS ONE
AB  - Background The ability to access and navigate online sexual health information and support is increasingly needed in order to engage with wider sexual healthcare. However, people from underserved populations may struggle to pass though this "digital doorway". Therefore, using a behavioural science approach, we first aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to i) seeking online sexual health information and ii) seeking online sexual health support. Subsequently, we aimed to generate theory-informed recommendations to improve these access points.Methods The PROGRESSPlus framework guided purposive recruitment (15.10.21-18.03.22) of 35 UK participants from diverse backgrounds, including 51% from the most deprived areas and 26% from minoritised ethnic groups. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we identified barriers and facilitators to seeking online sexual health information and support. A Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) analysis then identified recommendations to better meet the needs of underserved populations.Results We found diverse barriers and facilitators. Barriers included low awareness of and familiarity with online information and support; perceptions that online information and support were unlikely to meet the needs of underserved populations; overwhelming volume of information sources; lack of personal relevancy; chatbots/automated responses; and response wait times. Facilitators included clarity about credibility and quality; inclusive content; and in-person assistance. Recommendations included: Education and Persuasion e.g., online and offline promotion and endorsement by healthcare professionals and peers; Training and Modelling e.g., accessible training to enhance searching skills and credibility appraisal; and Environmental Restructuring and Enablement e.g., modifications to ensure online information and support are simple and easy to use, including video/audio options for content.Conclusions Given that access to many sexual health services is now digital, our analyses produced recommendations pivotal to increasing access to wider sexual healthcare among underserved populations. Implementing these recommendations could reduce inequalities associated with accessing and using online sexual health service.

TI  - How customers respond to chatbot anthropomorphism: the mediating roles of perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness
T2  - EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF MARKETING
AB  - Purpose - This study aims to investigate how chatbots' warmth and competence affect customer behavioural expectation (i.e. purchase, recommendation) through perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, prior knowledge of chatbot is considered the boundary condition of the effects of chatbots' warmth and competence. Design/methodology/approach - A lab-in-field experiment with 213 participants and a scenario-based experiment of 186 participants were used to test the model using partial least squares structural equation modelling via SmartPLS 4. Findings - Chatbot warmth positively affects customer behavioural expectation through perceived humanness while chatbot competence positively affects customer behavioural expectation through perceived persuasiveness. Prior knowledge of chatbot positively moderates the effect of chatbot warmth on perceived humanness. Research limitations/implications - This study provides nuanced insights into the effects of chatbots' warmth and competence on customer behavioural expectation. Future studies could extend the model by exploring additional boundary conditions of the effects of chatbots' warmth and competence in different generations. Practical implications This study offers insightful suggestions for marketing managers on how to impress and convert online customers through designing verbal scripts in customer-chatbot conversations that encourage the customers to anthropomorphise the chatbots. Originality/value - This study probes into the effects of chatbots' warmth and competence on customer behavioural expectation by proposing and examining a novel research model that incorporates perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness as the explanatory mechanisms and prior knowledge of chatbot as the boundary condition.

TI  - Enhancing COVID-19 Vaccination Awareness and Uptake in the Post-PHEIC Era: A Narrative Review of Physician-Level and System-Level Strategies
T2  - VACCINES
AB  - Following the World Health Organization's declaration that the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), COVID-19 remains an ongoing threat to human health and healthcare systems. Vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the disease's incidence, mitigating its severity, and limiting transmission, contributing to long-term public health resilience. However, incomplete vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy exist. This narrative review investigates strategies at the system and physician levels aimed at sustaining awareness and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in a post-PHEIC era. Through an examination of the existing literature, this review explores the effectiveness of diverse approaches utilized by healthcare systems and individual providers. These approaches address every component of the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy: confidence, complacency, constraints/convenience, calculation, and collective responsibility. Physician-level approaches include appropriate message framing, persuasive communication containing safety and personal/social benefit information, sharing of personal stories, creating a safe space for discussion, harnessing co-administration with annual influenza vaccines, and use of decision aids and visual messages. System-level approaches include messaging, mass media for health communication, on-site vaccine availability, pharmacist delivery, healthcare protocol integration, incentives, and chatbot use.

TI  - Decision making for people living with HIV/AIDS using the theory of innovation diffusion model at the Western Provident Association Turen Foundation
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
AB  - Objectives: To describe how people living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWHA) make decisions using the diffusion of innovation theory model. Decisions occur when individual decision makers engage in activities that guide choices to adopt or reject a particular innovation. Methods: This is a descriptive analysis research using a survey method. Data collection was carried out using a decision making questionnaire. The subjects in this research were HIV/AIDS sufferers (PLWHA) who lived in Turen, Indonesia. The number of research subjects was 36 respondents obtained using the purposive sampling technique on January 2023. Results: The research design used the correlation method with a cross sectional approach and the Spearman correlation coefficient statistical test. The research results show significance (2 -tailed) of 0.934 ( p >0.05). The correlation coefficient results are negative. Where the direction of the correlation produces showed a very weak relationship with a value of 0.014 and the results of the analysis between variables are not the same. This is because the persuasion stage was not tested in the analysis. Research shows that 8 (22.2%) patients rejected the decision making of PLWHA using the diffusion of innovation theory model at the Western Provident Association Turen Foundation, Turen, Indonesia, while 28 (77.7%) patients accepted it. It can be concluded that the majority of decisions made by HIV/AIDS patients at the ADIS Turen Peduli Warga Foundation are accepted. Conclusion: Knowledge of HIV/AIDS sufferers is at a good level, their decision making is mostly accepted and there is a meaningful relationship between knowledge and decision making in using a chatbot innovation. The suggestion from the research is that this chatbot innovation can be a source of further research and help provide education for PLWHA patients in everyday life.

TI  - Effects of interaction between brand positioning and chatbot conversational style on perceived fit and brand attitudes
T2  - PSYCHOLOGY & MARKETING
AB  - Although an underdog brand positioning can elicit positive consumer responses, maintaining a brand's positioning requires maintaining consistent brand associations. If the associations created by the company's service providers do not align with the brand's positioning, this discrepancy can lead to consumer confusion or to a decline in brand attitudes. Chatbots, as customer-facing representatives, play a crucial role in how consumers perceive and evaluate a brand. However, the role of chatbots in shaping brand attitude has not been extensively studied. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of chatbot conversational styles on consumers' perceptions of the fit between a brand's positioning and its messaging, focusing on both "top-dog" and "underdog" brands. This study demonstrates that underdog brands using chatbots with warm conversational styles and top-dog brands using chatbots with competent (i.e., professional) conversational styles foster positive brand evaluations by consumers through perceived fit. Additionally, this study introduces the concept of power state-an individual's degree of perceived control over their surroundings-as a moderator in human-chatbot interactions, demonstrating that high-power-state consumers of top-dog brands favor a competent conversational style, whereas low-power-state consumers favor a warm conversational style regardless of the brand's positioning.

TI  - A Persuasive Chatbot in an Aging-in-Place Environment
T2  - INTELLIGENT AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS 18, VOL 2, IAS18-2023
CP  - 18th International Conference on Intelligent Autonomous Systems (IAS)
AB  - With the increase of the senior citizen population worldwide, there is a growing need to create a technology-enabled environment that support older adults in living independently. This paper presents the development of a persuasive chatbot integrated with an aging in place solution, designed to assist senior citizens in leading healthy lifestyles. By utilizing a computational model of adaptive persuasion, the chatbot can effectively encourage users to engage in suitable exercises based on their health conditions and behavioral data collected from the aging in place system. Various persuasion strategies are available, tailored to the user's motivation and personal profile. A pilot study was conducted to assess the effectiveness of the chatbot in promoting exercise adherence and explore its usability. The study results demonstrate the chatbot's effectiveness in persuading the majority of participants to follow the recommended exercise routines, and overall user satisfaction with the chatbot's usage.

T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 24TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INTELLIGENT VIRTUAL AGENTS, IVA 2024
CP  - 24th International Conference on Intelligent Virtual Agents
AB  - A natural way to resolve different points of view and form opinions is through exchanging arguments and knowledge. Facing the vast amount of available information on the internet, people tend to focus on information consistent with their beliefs. To support a fair and unbiased opinion-building process, we propose an intelligent agent in the form of a chatbot that engages in a deliberative dialogue with a human. In contrast to persuasive systems, the chatbot aims to provide a diverse and representative overview - embedded in a conversation with the user. To account for a reflective and unbiased exploration of the topic, we enable the system to intervene if the user is too focused on their pre-existing opinion. To achieve that, the agent employs a metric to assess the user's focus on challenger arguments.
   We report on a user study with 45 participants showing that the intervention significantly affects the user's focus on challenger arguments. We further report significant main effects of intervention on the user's attention to crucial areas of the system, and report on multiple interaction effects of user characteristics.

TI  - From web forms to chatbots: The roles of consistency and reciprocity for user information disclosure
T2  - INFORMATION SYSTEMS JOURNAL
AB  - Interactive decision aids (IDAs) on websites often require users to disclose relevant information (e.g., preferences, contact information) to help users in making decisions (e.g., product choice). With technological advances in IDAs, websites increasingly switch from static, non-conversational IDAs (e.g., web forms) to conversational ones (e.g., chatbots) to boost user information disclosure that nurtures the websites' economic viability. While this novel form of IDAs is already widely employed in practice, information systems research has yet to examine the defining dialogue design features of conversational IDAs and their effects on eliciting user information. Drawing on persuasion theory and particularly on consistency and reciprocity as influence techniques, we develop a research model around two crucial dialogue design features of conversational IDAs. Specifically, we investigate the distinct and joint effects of conversational style (i.e., absence vs. presence of a conversational presentation of requests) and reciprocation triggers (i.e., absence vs. presence of reciprocity-inducing information) on user information disclosure (i.e., email addresses). By combining the complementary properties of a randomised field experiment (N = 386) and a follow-up online experiment (N = 182), we empirically provide evidence in support of the distinct and joint effects of conversational style and reciprocation triggers of IDAs on user information disclosure. Moreover, we demonstrate that these dialogue design features have indirect effects on information disclosure via perceptions of social presence and privacy concerns. Thus, our paper provides theoretical and practical insights into whether, how, and why critical IDA dialogue design features can better elicit user information for website services.

TI  - Striking an Emotional Chord: Effects of Emotional Appeals and Chatbot Anthropomorphism on Persuasive Science Communication
T2  - SCIENCE COMMUNICATION
AB  - Chatbots have been used to achieve persuasive goals in various communication contexts. This research investigates how chatbot anthropomorphism intersects with emotional appeals to influence persuasive outcomes in science communication by conducting two experiments in the contexts of skin cancer prevention and biodiversity conservation. The findings showed a matching effect between emotional appeals and anthropomorphic cues: For a chatbot with more anthropomorphic cues, fear appeals were more persuasive than hope appeals; in contrast, for a less anthropomorphic chatbot, hope appeals were more effective. A key psychological mechanism underlying the relationships was personal risk perceptions but only for fear appeals.

TI  - Using Language to Improve Health
T2  - JOURNAL OF SERVICE RESEARCH
AB  - Communication plays an integral role in service interactions and language shapes how service agents talk to customers, salespeople talk to prospects, and chatbots talk to consumers. But as Danaher, Berry, Howard, Moore, and Attai (2023) note, given healthcare's impact on quality of life, it's a particularly important domain to study effective communication. Their useful review and framework should help medical professionals improve patient interactions and encourage future research. That said, one paper can only cover so much ground, and there are several additional areas that deserve further attention. Building on their framework, we offer some additional areas for future work, including how to use language to better understand patients, how communication mediums (e.g., writing vs. speaking or online portals vs. email) shape what gets communicated, and how effective communication depends on the interaction's goals (e.g., persuasion vs. medical adherence).

TI  - Motivating COVID-19 Vaccination through Persuasive Communication: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
AB  - Vaccination is a vital defense against COVID-19 infections and outbreaks, yet vaccine hesitancy poses a significant threat to pandemic response and recovery. We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (N = 47) assessing the persuasive effects of COVID-19 communication on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Individual vs. collective appeals and gain vs. loss frames are among the most frequently assessed message features, but they generally do not make a difference in persuasion. Normative messages that highlight higher (vs. lower) prevalence of vaccine acceptance are more persuasive. Message sources overall have limited impact on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, but sources that have a shared identity with the message receivers tend to be persuasive. More engaging message channels such as interactive chatbots and videos are promising communication tools but are generally under-utilized and under-studied. Compared to no communication or irrelevant communication, COVID-19 vaccine messages generally have a small advantage in increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Messages that include 1) vaccine safety and/or efficacy information; 2) collective appeals combined with embarrassment appeals; and 3) political leaders' vaccine endorsement are among the most effective messaging strategies. There is no evidence of any backfire effects of COVID-19 vaccine messages. We discuss the implications of our findings for persuasive message design in pandemic vaccine communication.

TI  - Influence of chatbots on purchase invtention in social commerce
T2  - BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB  - The research investigates the effects of chatbot-delivered verbal (inspirational appeals) and non-verbal (ingratiation) cues on customers' purchase intentions on social commerce pages (study one). The research using a multi-method approach also investigates the role of social presence and ulterior motives in explaining the effects of the chatbot-delivered human-like cues on customers' purchase intentions (study two). Study one employs an experiment, followed by a structural equation model in study two. The results of study two enable the researchers to triangulate the results of study one and to understand the underlying causes of those results. The data was collected through an online experiment and an online survey for the two studies. The research reports that: (1) inspirational appeals delivered by chatbots positively influence purchase intentions; (2) ingratiation delivered using double-tap by chatbots does not significantly affect purchase intentions. The current research represents one of the first attempts to explore the influence of inspirational appeal and ingratiation delivered through chatbots on s-commerce purchase intentions.

TI  - An Overview of Chatbot-Based Mobile Mental Health Apps: Insights From App Description and User Reviews
T2  - JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH
AB  - Background: Chatbots are an emerging technology that show potential for mental health care apps to enable effective and practical evidence-based therapies. As this technology is still relatively new, little is known about recently developed apps and their characteristics and effectiveness.Objective: In this study, we aimed to provide an overview of the commercially available popular mental health chatbots and how they are perceived by users.Methods: We conducted an exploratory observation of 10 apps that offer support and treatment for a variety of mental health concerns with a built-in chatbot feature and qualitatively analyzed 3621 consumer reviews from the Google Play Store and 2624 consumer reviews from the Apple App Store.Results: We found that although chatbots' personalized, humanlike interactions were positively received by users, improper responses and assumptions about the personalities of users led to a loss of interest. As chatbots are always accessible and convenient, users can become overly attached to them and prefer them over interacting with friends and family. Furthermore, a chatbot may offer crisis care whenever the user needs it because of its 24/7 availability, but even recently developed chatbots lack the understanding of properly identifying a crisis. Chatbots considered in this study fostered a judgment-free environment and helped users feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chatbots have great potential to offer social and psychological support in situations where real-world human interaction, such as connecting to friends or family members or seeking professional support, is not preferred or possible to achieve. However, there are several restrictions and limitations that these chatbots must establish according to the level of service they offer. Too much reliance on technology can pose risks, such as isolation and insufficient assistance during times of crisis. Recommendations for customization and balanced persuasion to inform the design of effective chatbots for mental health support have been outlined based on the insights of our findings.(JMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2023;11:e44838) doi: 10.2196/44838

TI  - Developing Misinformation Immunity: How to Reason-Check Fallacious News in a Human-Computer Interaction Environment
T2  - SOCIAL MEDIA + SOCIETY
AB  - To counter the fake news phenomenon, the scholarly community has attempted to debunk and prebunk disinformation. However, misinformation still constitutes a major challenge due to the variety of misleading techniques and their continuous updates which call for the exercise of critical thinking to build resilience. In this study we present two open access chatbots, the Fake News Immunity Chatbot and the Vaccinating News Chatbot, which combine Fallacy Theory and Human-Computer Interaction to inoculate citizens and communication gatekeepers against misinformation. These chatbots differ from existing tools both in function and form. First, they target misinformation and enhance the identification of fallacious arguments; and second, they are multiagent and leverage discourse theories of persuasion in their conversational design. After having described both their backend and their frontend design, we report on the evaluation of the user interface and impact on users' critical thinking skills through a questionnaire, a crowdsourced survey, and a pilot qualitative experiment. The results shed light on the best practices to design user-friendly active inoculation tools and reveal that the two chatbots are perceived as increasing critical thinking skills in the current misinformation ecosystem.

TI  - Can Chatbots Be Persuasive? How to Boost the Effectiveness of Chatbot Recommendations for Increasing Purchase Intention
T2  - PROCEEDINGS OF THE 56TH ANNUAL HAWAII INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON SYSTEM SCIENCES
CP  - 56th Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)
AB  - Firms increasingly invest in chatbots that provide purchase recommendations. However, customers often reject recommendations by chatbots because they find neither the contents of the recommendation (message-level persuasiveness) nor the chatbot itself (source-level persuasiveness) persuasive. To overcome these barriers and increase purchase intention, this study examines how the content of recommendation messages should be designed and which communication style the chatbot should use to provide recommendation messages. Results of a 2 (two-sided vs. one-sided recommendation message) x 3 (warm vs. competent vs. neutral communication style) between-subject online experiment show that a two-sided recommendation message increases purchase intention, but only for chatbots using a warm or competent communication style. Whereas a warm chatbot leads to higher purchase intentions of a recommendation through promoting its source persuasiveness, a competent chatbot increases recommendation effectiveness by promoting message persuasiveness. Therefore, firms should refine a chatbot's communication style for providing recommendations that persuade customers to purchase.

TI  - An artificially intelligent, natural language processing chatbot designed to promote COVID-19 vaccination: A proof-of-concept pilot study
T2  - DIGITAL HEALTH
AB  - ObjectiveOur goal is to establish the feasibility of using an artificially intelligent chatbot in diverse healthcare settings to promote COVID-19 vaccination. MethodsWe designed an artificially intelligent chatbot deployed via short message services and web-based platforms. Guided by communication theories, we developed persuasive messages to respond to users' COVID-19-related questions and encourage vaccination. We implemented the system in healthcare settings in the U.S. between April 2021 and March 2022 and logged the number of users, topics discussed, and information on system accuracy in matching responses to user intents. We regularly reviewed queries and reclassified responses to better match responses to query intents as COVID-19 events evolved. ResultsA total of 2479 users engaged with the system, exchanging 3994 COVID-19 relevant messages. The most popular queries to the system were about boosters and where to get a vaccine. The system's accuracy rate in matching responses to user queries ranged from 54% to 91.1%. Accuracy lagged when new information related to COVID emerged, such as that related to the Delta variant. Accuracy increased when we added new content to the system. ConclusionsIt is feasible and potentially valuable to create chatbot systems using AI to facilitate access to current, accurate, complete, and persuasive information on infectious diseases. Such a system can be adapted to use with patients and populations needing detailed information and motivation to act in support of their health.

TI  - Examining the Effects of Conversational Chatbots on Changing Conspiracy Beliefs about Science: The Paradox of Interactivity
T2  - JOURNAL OF BROADCASTING & ELECTRONIC MEDIA
AB  - Conspiracy beliefs are commonly seen during times of uncertainty. This study examined whether a chatbot offering counter-conspiracy information can mitigate conspiracy beliefs and the role of chatbot empathy on its effectiveness. We conducted an online experiment in two different contexts (climate change vs. Covid-19) (N = 189). The results showed that as for Covid-19, participants who interacted with the chatbot with less empathetic expressions showed fewer changes in conspiracy beliefs than those who read the scientific news article. Regarding climate change, a chatbot with more empathetic expressions was more effective in changing conspiracy beliefs than an article, but only for people who can tolerate ambiguity.

TI  - Overcoming customer innovation resistance to the sustainable adoption of chatbot services: A community-enterprise perspective in Thailand
T2  - JOURNAL OF INNOVATION & KNOWLEDGE
AB  - The primary goal of utilizing chatbots for customer service is to fulfill customer requests without requiring a conversation. However, the challenge to the sustainable adoption of innovations is overcoming the obstacles that prevent the innovation's spread. The current study examined factors including consumers' perceptions, barriers and perceived risks that influence consumers' intentions to continue utilizing chatbot services in community enterprise. Modeling integrates the innovation-decision process in Phase 1 (knowledge, persuasion, and decision) with the technology acceptance model (TAM), perceived convenience and information quality. We also consider technological anxiety and openness to experience as potential barriers to individual innovation. The research model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLSSEM) from 401 users with no more than 6 months of community-enterprise chatbot experience. Key findings that perceived privacy and time risk directly affected attitudes and intentions toward using chatbots. Moreover, technological anxiety is a barrier that affects attitudes toward chatbot usage, while perceived information quality indirectly influences users to use chatbots continually. However, there was no correlation between openness to experience and attitudes toward the continued use of chatbots. The finding indicates that experienced chatbot users are concerned with privacy and time constraints. This study contributes significantly to knowledge of the impediments to the diffusion of sustainable innovations among communityenterprise entrepreneurs.(c) 2022 The Authors.

TI  - Fabulation, Machine Agents, and Spiritually Authorizing Encounters
T2  - RELIGIONS
AB  - This paper uses a Tavesian model of religious experience to make a modest theorization about the role of "fabulation", an embodied and affective process, to understand how some contemporary AI and robotics designers and users consider encounters with these technologies to be spiritually "authorizing". By "fabulation", we mean the Bergsonian concept of an evolved capacity that allows humans to see the potentialities of complex action within another object-in other words, an interior agential image, or "soul"; and by "authorizing", we mean "deemed as having some claim to arbitration, persuasion, and legitimacy" such that the user might make choices that affect their life or others in accordance with the AI or might have their spiritual needs met. We considered two case studies where this agency took on a spiritual or religious valence when contextualized as such for the user: a robotic Buddhist priest known as Mindar, and a chatbot called The Spirituality Chatbot. We show how understanding perceptions of AI or robots as being spiritual or religious in a way that authorizes behavioral changes requires understanding tendencies of the human body more so than it does any metaphysical nature of the technology itself.

TI  - "See the Image in Different Contexts": Using Reverse Image Search to Support the Identification of Fake News in Instagram-Like Social Media
T2  - INTELLIGENT TUTORING SYSTEMS, ITS 2022
CP  - 18th International Conference on Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS)
AB  - Social media are an integral part of the daily lives of today's young generation. In addition to the positive impact on learning through these channels, there are also risks related to toxic content like "fake news" on various social media. Fake news aims to change opinions based on disinformation or misinformation supporting conspiracy theories, e.g., related to the pandemic. Fake news creators use various multimedia artifacts, including images taken from serious and valid news sources, to attract the audience's attention. Tracking images in different contexts can give social media users important clues to distinguish fake news from credible information. We report on the development of a web-based learning environment that includes a "virtual learning companion" to help learners improve their understanding, awareness, and critical thinking concerning such social media threats. The learning environment mimics Instagram and includes toxic and nontoxic content in a controlled way. The companion is implemented as a browser plugin that communicates with students via chat. The companion poses knowledge activation questions and answers according to an underlying script. The companion offers other sources with the same image identified through Reverse Image Search (RIS). The goal is to help learners find the same image in different contexts with different textual descriptions and keywords. For this purpose, we added basic NLP mechanisms to extract keywords from these contexts, including keywords that signal persuasiveness. Currently, we evaluate the impact of this tool and the provided support in distinguishing fake or credible news.

TI  - Persuasive Design for Healthy Eating: A Scoping Review
T2  - DISTRIBUTED, AMBIENT AND PERVASIVE INTERACTIONS: SMART LIVING, LEARNING, WELL-BEING AND HEALTH, ART AND CREATIVITY, PT II
CP  - 10th International Conference on Distributed, Ambient and Pervasive Interactions (DAPI) Held as Part of the 24th International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction (HCII)
AB  - In this scoping review, we aimed to summarize and analyze the latest research developments of persuasive design for healthy eating behavior and explore future design opportunities. This paper initially collected 1231 papers from 2011 to 2021 in three different databases: the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library, IEEEXplore and SpringerLink databases. Based on a selection process, 28 papers that mainly focused on addressing dietary health by persuasive designs were eventually included in final analysis. These 28 papers were sorted by three characteristics: research specifications, methodologies, and design rationales. Our data analyses revealed that the reviewed papers primarily utilized persuasive technologies for eating behaviors monitoring, recording, and healthy eating suggestion. Moreover, six types of design applications were commonly implemented, including mobile applications, persuasive messages, digital products and service systems, wearable devices, chatbots/assistants, and public devices. Our review showed that persuasive design, as a generic approach for promoting healthy eating, lacked research investigations on personalized solutions for particular user groups such as office workers and teenagers. Future works could explore persuasive design strategies by applying the research factors of user experience and examining the efficacy of persuasive technology tools to effectively promote healthy eating behaviors for various user groups in different contexts.

TI  - Hypocrisy Induction: Using Chatbots to Promote COVID-19 Social Distancing
T2  - CYBERPSYCHOLOGY BEHAVIOR AND SOCIAL NETWORKING
AB  - Considering widespread resistance to COVID-19 preventive measures, the authors draw on hypocrisy induction theory to examine whether online chatbots can be used to induce hypocrisy and increase compliance with social distancing guidelines. The experiment demonstrates that when a chatbot induces hypocrisy by reminding participants that they have failed to comply with social distancing recommendations, they feel guilty about violating social norms. To reinstate confidence in their personal standards, they form favorable attitudes toward the chatbot ad and establish intentions to comply with recommendations. Interestingly, the persuasive power of hypocrisy induction differs depending on the level of anthropomorphism of the chatbot. When a humanlike chatbot reminds them of their hypocritical behavior, participants feel higher levels of guilt and act more desirably, but a machinelike chatbot is not effective for creating guilt or generating compliance.

T2  - SYMBOLIC AND QUANTITATIVE APPROACHES TO REASONING WITH UNCERTAINTY, ECSQARU 2021
CP  - 16th European Conference on Symbolic and Quantitative Approaches to Reasoning with Uncertainty (ECSQARU)
AB  - Chatbots have the potential of being used as dialogical argumentation systems for behaviour change applications. They thereby offer a cost-effective and scalable alternative to in-person consultations with health professionals that users could engage in from the comfort of their own home. During events like the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important than usual that people are well informed and make conscious decisions that benefit themselves. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a prime example of a behaviour that benefits the individual, as well as society as a whole. In this paper, we present a chatbot that engages in dialogues with users who do not want to get vaccinated, with the goal to persuade them to change their stance and get a vaccine. The chatbot is equipped with a small repository of arguments that it uses to counter user arguments on why the user is reluctant to get a vaccine. We evaluate our chatbot in a study with participants.

CP  - 9th International Conference on User Modeling, Adaptation and Personalization Human-Agent Interaction (HAI)
AB  - In this study, to mitigate cyberbullying in communication tools, we propose a method in which a chatbot pretending to be a member of a chat group defends the victim by proxy without permission (i.e., hijacking and proxy persuasion). An experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results of which showed that it increases the defending behavior of a user who was temporarily hijacked by the chatbot. However, compared with the existing method, the proposed method was found to have a problem with the continued use of the system.

T2  - JOURNAL OF BROADCASTING & ELECTRONIC MEDIA
AB  - Online users are increasingly exposed to chatbots as one form of AI-enabled media technologies, employed for persuasive purposes, e.g., making product/service recommendations. However, the persuasive potential of chatbots has not yet been fully explored. Using an online experiment (N = 242), we investigate the extent to which communicating with a stand-alone chatbot influences affective and behavioral responses compared to interactive Web sites. Several underlying mechanisms are studied, showing that enjoyment is the key mechanism explaining the positive effect of chatbots (vs. Web sites) on recommendation adherence and attitudes. Contrary to expectations, perceived anthropomorphism seems not to be particularly relevant in this comparison.

T2  - COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF ARGUMENT (COMMA 2020)
CP  - Biennial International Conference on Computational Models of Argument (COMMA)
AB  - Chatbots are versatile tools that have the potential of being used for computational persuasion where the chatbot acts as the persuader and the human agent as the persuadee. To allow the user to type his or her arguments, as opposed to selecting them from a menu, the chatbot needs a sufficiently large knowledge base of arguments and counterarguments. And in order to make the user change their current stance on a subject, the chatbot needs a method to select persuasive counterarguments. To address this, we present a chatbot that is equipped with an argument graph and the ability to identify the concerns of the user argument in order to select appropriate counterarguments. We evaluate the bot in a study with participants and show how using our method can make the chatbot more persuasive.

CP  - 42nd German Conference on Artificial Intelligence (KI)
AB  - Computational persuasion aims to capture the human ability to persuade through argumentation for applications such as behaviour change in healthcare (e.g. persuading people to take more exercise or eat more healthily). In this paper, we review research in computational persuasion that incorporates domain modelling (capturing arguments and counterarguments that can appear in a persuasion dialogues), user modelling (capturing the beliefs and concerns of the persuadee), and dialogue strategies (choosing the best moves for the persuader to maximize the chances that the persuadee is persuaded). We discuss evaluation of prototype systems that get the user's counterarguments by allowing them to select them from a menu. Then we consider how this work might be enhanced by incorporating a natural language interface in the form of an argumentative chatbot.

AB  - In this paper we present design concepts for a chatbot than can be used for argument acquisition. We call the acquisition of arguments by means of a chat-bot argument harvesting. The chat-bot asks the user for his or her arguments on a topic of interest. It can also be used to harvest counterargument, values, preferences, as well as information about the user like his/her personal circumstances. The harvested arguments and other attributes have various applications from the instantiation of argument graphs to the development of computational persuasion systems.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a new theoretically motivated application framework, Wenner, for developing tailored interactions for an exercise-oriented well-being application. The framework allows us to conduct in-lab and 'in the wild' studies to directly deploy and evaluate the effects of our interventions. We describe two systems that have been developed using the framework. The first WennerStep is an individually tailored text based approach to delivering adaptive persuasive messaging using a smartwatch. The second WennerAgent, is a virtual embodied coach who adaptively reacts to user activity with emotionally appropriate responses. We conclude with a discussion in which we describe outstanding challenges for our approach and relate this to current work on Chatbot deployments for well-being.

AB  - Gamification in the era of chatbots is a novel way to engage users with the chatbot application. When developing a gamified chatbot system, there are factors related to user types (ages, gender and others) that we should consider to effectively integrate the game elements into the chatbot while targeting the right audience. In this study, we discuss the development of an educational chatbot game 'CiboPoli', that's specialised in teaching children about healthy lifestyle through an interactive social game environment. The presented game is based on a paper prototype that we developed to teach primary school students about healthy diet and food waste management. The current approach will be more engaging and pose AI capabilities. This is still a work in progress and we plan to improve its design by incorporating additional components, such as dialog management module, user-specific knowledge module or machine learning module. Future work will be devoted to integrating machine learning to automatically identify learners emotions and provide personalised suggestions. Moreover, we tested the initial prototype with school students and found that it outperforms the paper version. Future work will focus on applying it to other domains and demographics.

AB  - Digital technology can make cities smart. City managements can make use of in-formation that can be extracted from databases in which data is collected about energy consumption, traffic behavior, waste management, human behavior in public environments and opinions of the general public, for example as they can be collected from social media. But can this digital technology and the data collected from it help to make living in a city more enjoyable? How can digital technology and information provided by digital technology make cities playful, allow citizens to engage in playful and entertaining activities that help to enjoy their daily and sometimes boring activities such as travelling, working, child care, house-keeping? This paper investigates how sensors and actuators in an urban environment can be introduced and used to design playful applications. We observe how ideas about playable cities emerge and develop. Interactive digital installations can provide fun, urban games can provide fun, but the experiences obtained from them can as well provide urban designers, architects, gamification and public media designers about public behavior and preferences.
