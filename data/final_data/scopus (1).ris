AB  - The ability of ChatGPT to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts has generated considerable anxiety among those concerned that students might use such large language models (LLMs) to write their assignments. The extent to which LLMs can mimic human writers is starting to be explored, but we know little about their ability to use nominal resources to create effective academic texts. This study investigates metadiscursive nouns in argumentative essays, comparing how ChatGPT and university students employ these devices to organise text, express stance, and construct persuasive arguments. By analysing 145 essays from each source, we examine the syntactic patterns, interactive functions, and interactional uses of metadiscursive nouns. The analysis reveals that while overall frequencies were similar, ChatGPT has distinct preferences for simpler syntactic constructions (particularly the determiner + N pattern) and relies heavily on anaphoric references, whereas students demonstrate more balanced syntactic distribution and greater use of cataphoric references. Interactionally, ChatGPT prefers manner nouns for descriptive precision, while students favour status nouns for evaluative reasoning and evidential nouns for empirical grounding. These findings show that, while structurally coherent, LLM-generated texts often lack the rhetorical flexibility and evaluative sophistication of human academic writing, offering valuable insights for EAP pedagogy. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent advances in generative AI have precipitated a proliferation of novel writing assistants. These systems typically rely on multilingual large language models (LLMs), providing globalized workers the ability to revise or create diverse forms of content in different languages. However, there is substantial evidence indicating that the performance of multilingual LLMs varies between languages. Users who employ writing assistance for multiple languages are therefore susceptible to disparate output quality. Importantly, recent research has shown that people tend to generalize algorithmic errors across independent tasks, violating the behavioral axiom of choice independence. In this paper, we analyze whether user utilization of novel writing assistants in a charity advertisement writing task is affected by the AI's performance in a second language. Furthermore, we quantify the extent to which these patterns translate into the persuasiveness of generated charity advertisements, as well as the role of peoples' beliefs about LLM utilization for their donation choices. Our results provide evidence that writers who engage with an LLM-based writing assistant violate choice independence, as prior exposure to a Spanish LLM reduces subsequent utilization of an English LLM. While these patterns do not affect the aggregate persuasiveness of the generated advertisements, people's beliefs about the source of an advertisement (human versus AI) do. In particular, Spanish-speaking female participants who believed that they read an AI-generated advertisement strongly adjusted their donation behavior downwards. Furthermore, people are generally not able to adequately differentiate between human-generated and LLM-generated ads. Our work has important implications on the design, development, integration, and adoption of multilingual LLMs as assistive agents - particularly in writing tasks. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Compared to human influencers, AI influencers offer advantages such as low cost, high efficiency, and fairer handling of objective tasks. However, they are believed to have shortcomings in perception and empathy abilities. How can companies select the more appropriate promoter between AI influencers and human influencers based on their marketing content? How can enterprises design more persuasive marketing content according to the type of influencer? Three behavioral experiments were conducted in this paper. The results indicate that when AI influencers post marketing content with functional advertising appeal, they can significantly enhance people's perceived trust. When human influencers share marketing content with experiential advertising appeal, they can significantly improve people's perceived empathy. Consumers with lower levels of knowledge are more susceptible to the matching effect of influencer type and advertising appeal type on the persuasive effect of marketing content than those with higher levels of knowledge. The conclusions of this study assist enterprises in scientifically matching influencer types with advertising appeals. By choosing influencers based on the nature of the marketing content or designing suitable marketing content based on the influencer type, companies can maximize marketing effectiveness. This refined marketing strategy not only improves the persuasive effect of the marketing content but also strengthens the brand's market competitiveness. © 2024 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Multimodal online reviews have been an essential marketing tool for dominating consumer perception. However, the precise impact of visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, and olfactory cues in multimodal content on consumers’ perceived review usefulness remains unclear. This study aims to fill this gap by exploring how text and image contents affect review usefulness from a multisensory perspective. To this end, we proposed a framework that combined machine learning and multimodal large language models to quantify the multisensory elements conveyed through review text and images. Based on the Poisson regression model, the estimation results show that while multisensory elements in text and images have a generally consistent impact on consumer perception, each sensory element carries distinct value. Furthermore, the sensory discrepancy in text and images has a negative effect on the perceived review usefulness. Our findings contribute theoretically to enhancing review persuasion effect and sensory marketing literature. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent research on automated negotiation has primarily focused on improving the artificial intelligence of agents and equipping them with more flexible internal mechanisms to facilitate high-quality negotiations. However, the study on the systematic modeling of human-like psychological and behavioral activities and their role in the negotiation process is still in its early stages. In light of this, this paper proposes an emotional persuasion model that takes into account the effect of negotiators' integrated trust assessments on negotiation. Firstly, the paper presents a negotiation agent with both cognitive and emotional functions, detailing its internal system and operating mechanism. Secondly, the integrated trust of a negotiator is obtained by evaluating multiple single trusts, and the mapping of the integrated trust to the negotiation round parameter is modeled. Integrated trust is also parameterized into the agent's cognitive processes. Finally, the paper introduces a new framework for the generation of emotional persuasive behavior to assist agents in making new proposals. A series of experiments were conducted, yielding the following results: Compared with the non-emotional model, the performance of negotiation rounds and utility differences improved by 7.97 % and 4.81 %, respectively. Furthermore, the trust-driven emotional persuasion model outperformed the several existing competing models by at least 31.1 % in utility difference and 81.0 % in negotiation rounds. Additionally, a case study of human-computer negotiation demonstrated that the agent designed using the proposed method has negotiating capabilities comparable to those of a real human, which further showcases the application effect of the artificial intelligence agent in practice. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Behavioural science literature has seen the recent emergence of nudge theory, a proposition that behaviour change can be achieved by altering the 'choice architecture' of our physical and digital environments while considering the boundaries of human rationality. This chapter advocates the term 'precision nudging', the use of artificial intelligence to advance the efficacy of nudges while mitigating their adverse effects. It discusses two methods of precision nudging, tailoring and timing, and their potential in addressing adverse effects, in particular, behavioural spillovers and misfires. In doing so, the authors categorize nudges as reactive ones that aim at improving adverse effects and proactive ones that aim to shield individuals from future spillovers and misfires. © CAB International 2025.

AB  - Transformative change is needed across the food system to improve health and environmental outcomes. As food, nutrition, environmental and health data are generated beyond human scale, there is an opportunity for technological tools to support multifactorial, integrated, scalable approaches to address the complexities of dietary behaviour change. Responsible technology could act as a mechanistic conduit between research, policy, industry and society, enabling timely, informed decision making and action by all stakeholders across the food system. Domain expertise in food, nutrition and health should always be integrated into both the development and continuous deployment of AI-powered nutritional intelligence (NI) to ensure it is responsible, accurate, safe, useable and effective. Dietary behaviours are complex and improving diet-related health outcomes requires socio-cultural-demographic considerations within the design and deployment of NI tools. This article describes existing examples of NI within the food system and future opportunities. Human-in-the-loop approaches with food, health and nutrition experts involved at all stages including data acquisition, processing, output validation and ongoing quality assurance are essential to ensure evidence-based practice. The same ethical considerations should apply in this domain as in any other (e.g. privacy, inclusivity, robustness, transparency and accountability) and responsible practice must encompass rigorous standards and alignment with regulatory frameworks. Critical today and in the future is accessibility to appropriate high-quality food compositional data sets, which include up-to-date information on commercially available products that reflect the constantly evolving food landscape to realise the potential of responsible AI to help address the existing food system challenges. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - We use a duoethnographic approach to study how wearable-integrated LLM chatbots can assist with personalized stress management, addressing the growing need for immediacy and tailored interventions. Two researchers interacted with custom chatbots over 22 days, responding to wearable-detected physiological prompts, recording stressor phrases, and using them to seek tailored interventions from their LLM-powered chatbots. They recorded their experiences in autoethnographic diaries and analyzed them during weekly discussions, focusing on the relevance, clarity, and impact of chatbot-generated interventions. Results showed that even though most events triggered by the wearable were meaningful, only one in five warranted an intervention. It also showed that interventions tailored with brief event descriptions were more effective than generic ones. By examining the intersection of wearables and LLM, this research contributes to developing more effective, user-centric mental health tools for real-time stress relief and behavior change. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Recently, there has been increasing research on designing chatbots for behavior change. While trust between individuals and their supporters is recognized as a crucial factor in fostering behavior change, it remains unclear what types of dialogue contribute to building such trust. In this study, we investigated health guidance interviews to address two key questions: 1. What kind of trust relationship facilitates behavior change? and 2. What type of dialogue contributes to fostering that trust? Our findings indicate that individuals were more motivated to pursue behavioral goals when they perceived the interviewer as having integrity. Furthermore, an analysis of interviewer speech using four dialogue categories revealed that perceptions of integrity were stronger when interviewers spent more time on “Providing Tailored Insights” rather than “Building a Trust Relationship.” These insights contribute to designing chatbots that effectively support behavior change by fostering trust through dialogue strategies. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Mining and conveying actionable insights from complex data is a key challenge of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and storytelling. To address this challenge, we present a design space for actionable EDA and storytelling. Synthesizing theory and expert interviews, we highlight how semantic precision, rhetorical persuasion, and pragmatic relevance underpin effective EDA and storytelling. We also show how this design space subsumes common challenges in actionable EDA and storytelling, such as identifying appropriate analytical strategies and leveraging relevant domain knowledge. Building on the potential of LLMs to generate coherent narratives with commonsense reasoning, we contribute Jupybara, an AI-enabled assistant for actionable EDA and storytelling implemented as a Jupyter Notebook extension. Jupybara employs two strategies - design-space-aware prompting and multi-agent architectures - to operationalize our design space. An expert evaluation confirms Jupybara's usability, steerability, explainability, and reparability, as well as the effectiveness of our strategies in operationalizing the design space framework with LLMs. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper proposes an iterative optimization method for trajectory control of connected automated vehicles (CAVs) at an off-ramp bottleneck, aiming to improve energy consumption and pollutant emissions in the traffic system. The methodology integrates real-world data from the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM) dataset and generated data from each iteration. A comprehensive cost function is developed to evaluate safety, efficiency, comfort, equilibrium, lane-changing, energy, and emissions. The lane-changing process is divided into two stages: lane-changing decision-making (LCD) and lane-changing execution (LCE), modeled using advanced artificial intelligence algorithms. Specifically, gcForest is applied to model LCD, while long short-term memory (LSTM) is used for LCE, allowing for more precise control of lane-changing behavior. The analysis considers fuel consumption and key vehicular emissions, including carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOC), and particulate matter (PM). The results indicate that energy consumption and pollutant emissions are reduced by 20 % after three iterations of optimization. Furthermore, the iterative method demonstrates significant environmental improvements, particularly when the CAV market penetration rate (MPR) reaches approximately 50 %. Higher MPR levels further enhance the sustainability benefits of CAVs, making them more advantageous for promoting sustainable traffic development. © 2025

AB  - Deepfakes are one of the most recent developments in misinformation technology and are capable of superimposing one person’s face onto another in video format. The potential of this technology to defame and cause harm is clear. However, despite the grave concerns expressed about deepfakes, these concerns are rarely accompanied with empirical evidence. We present a scoping review of the existing empirical studies that aim to investigate the effects of viewing deepfakes on people’s beliefs, memories, and behaviour. Five databases were searched, producing an initial sample of 2004 papers, from which 22 relevant papers were identified, varying in methodology and research methods used. Overall, we found that the early studies on this topic have often produced inconclusive findings regarding the existence of uniquely persuasive or convincing effects of deepfake exposure. Moreover, many experiments demonstrated poor methodology and did not include a non-deepfake comparator (e.g., text-based misinformation). We conclude that speculation and scare mongering about dystopian uses of deepfake technologies has far outpaced experimental research that assess these harms. We close by offering insights on how to conduct improved empirical work in this area. © 2025 Ching et al.

AB  - Emissions from more frequent and prolonged landscape fires (wildfires, risk reduction fires, agricultural burning) can expose populations to high levels of air pollution and exacerbate a range of health conditions. This systematic review aims to map, evaluate, and synthesise the scientific literature reporting interventions that can reduce exposure to landscape fire smoke (LFS). Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science and reviewed relevant literature published until March 2024. Thirty-three studies from four countries met the eligibility criteria. Of the interventions evaluated, air filtration was the most frequently reported, and included use of portable air cleaners (PACs) with high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters, ventilation systems with standard and upgraded filters, and low-cost fan filter units (FFU). The effectiveness of PACs for fine particulate matter (PM2.5) reduction ranged between 54 %–92 %. In naturally ventilated residences, concentrations of PM2.5 were 0–44 % lower indoors, and depended on the duration of LFS, building operation, and permeability. Mechanical ventilation with minimum efficiency reporting value (MERV) 5/8 filters in buildings reduced LFS PM2.5 levels by 18–58 %; however, use of higher rated filters (e.g., MERV 12/13) achieved reductions of up to 87 %. Communication interventions, including smartphone apps and alerts/messages from various media sources (e.g., radio, television, internet) had mixed results; nevertheless, inclusion of spirometry and asthma control surveys during app use could improve health outcomes for vulnerable groups. The efficacy of facemasks (N95/P2) was up to 94 % for single pass PM2.5 removal, although they were relatively underutilised. Clean air shelters in public buildings can potentially provide a place for exposure reduction and social support, but have not been sufficiently tested during LFS events. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of interventions during prolonged smoke events, and in low- and middle-income countries. © 2025

AB  - AI-generated counterspeech offers a promising and scalable strategy to curb online toxicity through direct replies that promote civil discourse. However, current counterspeech is one-size-fits-all, lacking adaptation to the moderation context and the users involved. We propose and evaluate multiple strategies for generating tailored counterspeech that is adapted to the moderation context and personalized for the moderated user. We instruct a LLaMA2-13B model to generate counterspeech, experimenting with various configurations based on different contextual information and fine-tuning strategies. We identify the configurations that generate persuasive counterspeech through a combination of quantitative indicators and human evaluations collected via a pre-registered mixed-design crowdsourcing experiment. Results show that contextualized counterspeech can significantly outperform state-of-the-art generic counterspeech in adequacy and persuasiveness, without compromising other characteristics. Our findings also reveal a poor correlation between quantitative indicators and human evaluations, suggesting that these methods assess different aspects and highlighting the need for nuanced evaluation methodologies. The effectiveness of contextualized AI-generated counterspeech and the divergence between human and algorithmic evaluations underscore the importance of increased human-AI collaboration in content moderation. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Social media has witnessed different eating practices, including food mukbang. Food mukbang is a type of video presentation where hosts consume large quantities of food while interacting with viewers. This study is situated on the social eating theory, which explains how people connect their individual interests with society. Though this practice has been on social media platforms for a while now, little is known about its health impact on a wide range of audiences. Unhealthy eating practices are associated with obesity and other chronic diseases, which are the leading causes of death in the world today. Given that there are unhealthy eating practices in food mukbang videos on social media, we collected thirty (30) food mukbang creative common license YouTube videos, and we extracted 2297 comments from these videos to study the trends. In view of this, we found that there is a collection of more unhealthy foods eaten to entertain viewers, different unhealthy eating behaviors such as eating quickly, talking while eating, and putting too much food in the mouth. In addition, we found that the viewers’ sentiments were positive, and they loved watching these videos. Hence, in its best practice, we propose an AI-driven persuasive intervention because AI technologies are capable of detecting unhealthy eating patterns and persuasive interventions can promote a change in behavior (healthy eating behavior). Based on our findings, we present three design recommendations for YouTube and other social media designers to consider in future: (1) using artificial intelligence-related technologies for predicting videos, (2) using natural language processing to prompt feedback, and (3) auto-generating disclaimers at the beginning and end of the video. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Exposure to counterattitudinal information has been shown to yield mixed effects on attitude polarization. The current research explores the differential impact of such information when generated by artificial intelligence (AI) versus human sources. While prior work highlights a general aversion to AI for decision-making, our research reveals a consistent openness to AI in the context of counterattitudinal messages. Across four pre-registered studies (N = 2061), we find that when people receive counterattitudinal messages on potentially polarizing issues, AI sources are perceived as less biased, more informative, and having less persuasive intent than human sources. This leads to greater receptiveness to counterattitudinal messages when those messages come from AI rather than human sources. In addition, we find preliminary evidence that receiving counterattitudinal messages from an AI (versus human) source can diminish outgroup animosity and facilitate attitude change. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human decision-making processes at the workplace presents both opportunities and challenges. One promising approach to leverage existing complementary capabilities is allowing humans to delegate individual instances of decision tasks to AI. However, enabling humans to delegate instances effectively requires them to assess several factors. One key factor is the analysis of both their own capabilities and those of the AI in the context of the given task. In this work, we conduct a behavioral study to explore the effects of providing contextual information to support this delegation decision. Specifically, we investigate how contextual information about the AI and the task domain influence humans’ delegation decisions to an AI and their impact on the human-AI team performance. Our findings reveal that access to contextual information significantly improves human-AI team performance in delegation settings. Finally, we show that the delegation behavior changes with the different types of contextual information. Overall, this research advances the understanding of computer-supported, collaborative work and provides actionable insights for designing more effective collaborative systems. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Obesity is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality with health consequences that crosscut most medical specialties. Despite the emergence of effective and promising new therapies, many impediments to comprehensive obesity care remain. As part of their commitment to improving obesity care, the American College of Physicians (ACP) and its Council of Subspecialty Societies (CSS) held a summit on 24 October 2023 to identify barriers to and opportunities for collaborative action in the domains of physician education, health care policy and care delivery, and addressing weight bias. This report summarizes the summit proceedings and provides a postsummit synthesis from ACP and CSS. Key themes were centered on knowledge, advocacy, action, and compassion, including the need for culture change, paradigm shifts, and stakeholder engagement and collaboration; a focus on empowerment of both clinicians and patients; the importance of knowing patients as people to help address social determinants of health; the need to address learned helplessness; and the importance of embracing artificial intelligence and technology as disruptive innovations. Recommendations for next steps for collaborative action include leveraging and improving already available educational and clinical resources, developing obesity education and care standards that incorporate patients’ perspectives and address social determinants of health, developing community and public-private partnerships to improve access and public awareness, and coordinating messaging and policy advocacy efforts that align with mitigating the longstanding obesity epidemic. © 2025 American College of Physicians.

AB  - Cyberhate presents a multifaceted, context-sensitive challenge that existing detection methods often struggle to tackle effectively. Large language models (LLMs) exhibit considerable potential for improving cyberhate detection due to their advanced contextual understanding. However, detection alone is insufficient; it is crucial for software to also promote healthier user behaviors and empower individuals to actively confront the spread of cyberhate. This study investigates whether integrating large language models (LLMs) with persuasive technology (PT) can effectively detect cyberhate and encourage prosocial user behavior in digital spaces. Through an empirical study, we examine users’ perceptions of a self-monitoring persuasive strategy designed to reduce cyberhate. Specifically, the study introduces the Comment Analysis Feature to limit cyberhate spread, utilizing a prompt-based fine-tuning approach combined with LLMs. By framing users’ comments within the relevant context of cyberhate, the feature classifies input as either cyberhate or non-cyberhate and generates context-aware alternative statements when necessary to encourage more positive communication. A case study evaluated its real-world performance, examining user comments, detection accuracy, and the impact of alternative statements on user engagement and perception. The findings indicate that while most of the users (83%) found the suggestions clear and helpful, some resisted them, either because they felt the changes were irrelevant or misaligned with their intended expression (15%) or because they perceived them as a form of censorship (36%). However, a substantial number of users (40%) believed the interventions enhanced their language and overall commenting tone, with 68% suggesting they could have a positive long-term impact on reducing cyberhate. These insights highlight the potential of combining LLMs and PT to promote healthier online discourse while underscoring the need to address user concerns regarding relevance, intent, and freedom of expression. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, specifically large language models (LLMs), have the capability to generate not just misinformation, but also deceptive explanations that can justify and propagate false information and discredit true information. We examined the impact of deceptive AI generated explanations on individuals' beliefs in a pre-registered online experiment with 11,780 observations from 589 participants. We found that in addition to being more persuasive than accurate and honest explanations, AI-generated deceptive explanations can significantly amplify belief in false news headlines and undermine true ones as compared to AI systems that simply classify the headline incorrectly as being true/false. Moreover, our results show that logically invalid explanations are deemed less credible - diminishing the effects of deception. This underscores the importance of teaching logical reasoning and critical thinking skills to identify logically invalid arguments, fostering greater resilience against advanced AI-driven misinformation. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Access to behavior analytic services is limited and often unavailable for many in areas with a dearth of qualified providers. Tools to support behavior-change agents located in the natural environment of consumers may be a way to provide behavioral interventions. An artificial intelligence (AI) platform that guides the implementation of behavioral interventions may be useful for supporting procedural fidelity. The current studies evaluated whether an AI platform was effective at increasing and maintaining high levels of procedural fidelity in individuals with little to no prior training. Participants were two behavior technicians in training (Exp. 1) and three caregivers (Exp. 2). Introducing guidance provided by the AI platform GAINS improved the procedural fidelity with which behavior technicians and caregivers implemented behavioral interventions with children with autism, except for one caregiver. These results suggest AI platforms may be useful tools for supporting high levels of procedural fidelity by novice users. © 2025 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - AI companion applications are transforming how people form and maintain relationships in the digital world, with millions of users now engaging in emotional and social interactions with AI agents. Understanding what drives user satisfaction becomes crucial as these applications become increasingly integrated into users' daily lives. Drawing on Orlikowski's practice lens theory and employing text mining and hierarchical clustering methodologies on user reviews enhanced with focus group discussions, this study identifies two key determinants of user satisfaction: Functional Capability Perception and Affective Social Attunement. The analysis of 156,637 user reviews and insights from diverse participants reveals that satisfaction emerges through users' simultaneous negotiation of technical proficiency and emotional boundaries in their AI interactions. Functional capabilities positively influence satisfaction, while deeper emotional engagement creates a paradoxical effect where users become more sensitive to AI limitations. The study demonstrates how societal conditions shape these dynamics, with evaluation criteria evolving from simple acceptance to deeper interpersonal connections, reflecting changing attitudes toward human-AI relationships. Our mixed methods approach uncovers the contextual factors and usage patterns that shape how users integrate these technologies into their daily routines and emotional ecosystems. These insights advance our understanding of human-AI relationships while providing practical guidance for developers on creating adaptive systems that respond to evolving user needs. By understanding these complex dynamics, stakeholders can develop AI companions that enhance human relationships rather than attempting to replace them. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Within the mHealth framework, systematic research that collects and analyzes patient data to establish comprehensive digital health archives for hypertensive patients, and leverages large language models (LLMs) to assist clinicians in health management and Blood Pressure (BP) control remains limited. In this study, our aims to describe the design, development and usability evaluation process of a management platform (Hyper-DREAM) for hypertension. Our multidisciplinary team employed an iterative design approach over the course of a year to develop the Hyper-DREAM platform. This platform's primary functionalities encompass multimodal data collection (personal hypertensive digital phenotype archive), multimodal interventions (BP measurement, medication assistance, behavior modification, and hypertension education) and multimodal interactions (clinician-patient engagement and BP Coach component). In August 2024, the mHealth App Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ) was conducted involving 51 hypertensive patients recruited from three distinct centers. In parallel, six clinicians engaged in management activities and contributed feedback via the Doctor’s Software Satisfaction Questionnaire (DSSQ). Concurrently, a real-world comparative experiment was conducted to evaluate the usability of the BP Coach, ChatGPT-4o Mini, ChatGPT-4o and clinicians. The comparative experiment demonstrated that the BP Coach achieved significantly higher scores in utility (mean scores 4.05, SD 0.87) and completeness (mean scores 4.12, SD 0.78) when compared to ChatGPT-4o Mini, ChatGPT-4o, and clinicians. In terms of clarity, the BP Coach was slightly lower than clinicians (mean scores 4.03, SD 0.88). In addition, the BP Coach exhibited lower performance in conciseness (mean scores 3.00, SD 0.96). Clinicians reported a marked improvement in work efficiency (2.67 vs. 4.17, P <.001) and experienced faster and more effective patient interactions (3.0 vs. 4.17, P =.004). Furthermore, the Hyper-DREAM platform significantly decreased work intensity (2.5 vs. 3.5, P =.01) and minimized disruptions to daily routines (2.33 vs. 3.55, P =.004). The Hyper-DREAM platform demonstrated significantly greater overall satisfaction compared to the WeChat-based standard management (3.33 vs. 4.17, P =.01). Additionally, clinicians exhibited a markedly higher willingness to integrate the Hyper-DREAM platform into clinical practice (2.67 vs. 4.17, P <.001). Furthermore, patient management time decreased from 11.5 min (SD 1.87) with Wechat-based standard management to 7.5 min (SD 1.84, P =.01) with Hyper-DREAM. Hypertensive patients reported high satisfaction with the Hyper-DREAM platform, including ease of use (mean scores 1.60, SD 0.69), system information arrangement (mean scores 1.69, SD 0.71), and usefulness (mean scores 1.57, SD 0.58). In conclusion, our study presents Hyper-DREAM, a novel artificial intelligence-driven platform for hypertension management, designed to alleviate clinician workload and exhibiting significant promise for clinical application. The Hyper-DREAM platform is distinguished by its user-friendliness, high satisfaction rates, utility, and effective organization of information. Furthermore, the BP Coach component underscores the potential of LLMs in advancing mHealth approaches to hypertension management. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Background: Tobacco use remains a significant global health challenge, contributing substantially to preventable morbidity and mortality. Despite established interventions, outcomes vary due to scalability issues, resource constraints, and limited reach. Objective: To systematically explore current artificial intelligence (AI) applications within tobacco control, highlighting their usefulness, benefits, limitations, and ethical implications. Method: This scoping review followed the Arksey and O'Malley framework and PRISMA-ScR guidelines. Five major databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, IEEE Xplore, and PsycINFO) were searched for articles published between January 2010 and March 2025. From 1,172 initial records, 57 studies met inclusion criteria after screening. Results: AI-driven tools, including machine learning and natural language processing, effectively monitor social media for emerging tobacco trends and personalize smoking cessation interventions. Applications were predominantly focused on predictive modelling (using algorithms like XGBoost and SVM to predict e-cigarette use and relapse risk), cessation support (employing chatbots and reinforcement learning to improve accessibility), and social media surveillance (detecting synthetic nicotine promotions and analysing vaping trends). Approximately 22% of studies aligned with WHO FCTC Article 13 (tobacco advertising regulation), while 45% supported Article 14 (cessation services). However, tobacco industry interference remains a critical challenge, with AI technologies exploited to undermine public health initiatives, target vulnerable populations, and manipulate policy discussions. Critical issues including algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, interpretability challenges, and data quality must be addressed to ensure positive impact. Conclusion: AI holds considerable promise for extending tobacco control if implemented ethically, transparently, and collaboratively. Future directions emphasize explainable AI development, integration of real-time intervention systems, global data inclusion, and robust cross-sector collaboration. While the current landscape shows a laudable start, it reflects the need for more diverse skill sets to fully harness AI's extensive prospects for tobacco control and achieving tobacco endgame goals. © 2025 The Author(s)

AB  - Conversational tutoring systems (CTSs) offer a promising avenue for individualized learning support, especially in domains like persuasive writing. Although these systems have the potential to enhance the learning process, the specific role of learner control and inter- activity within them remains underexplored. This paper introduces WritingTutor, a CTS designed to guide students through the pro- cess of crafting persuasive essays, with a focus on varying levels of learner control. In an experimental study involving 96 students, we evaluated the effects of high-level learner control, encompassing con- tent navigation and interface appearance control, against a benchmark version of WritingTutor without these features and a static, non- interactive tutoring group. Preliminary findings suggest that tutoring and learner control might enhance the learning experience in terms of enjoyment, ease-of-use, and perceived autonomy. However, these differences are not significant after pair-wise comparison and appear not to translate to significant differences in learning outcomes. This research contributes to the understanding of learner control in CTS, offering empirical insights into its influence on the learning experience. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Abstract: Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly influenced educational technologies, reshaping the teaching and learning landscape. However, the notion of fully automating the teaching process remains contentious. This paper explores the concept of hybrid intelligence (HI), which emphasizes the synergistic collaboration between AI and humans to optimize learning outcomes. Despite the potential of AI-enhanced learning systems, their application in a human-AI collaboration system often fails to meet anticipated standards, and there needs to be more empirical evidence showcasing their effectiveness. To address this gap, this study investigates whether formative feedback in an HI learning environment helps law students learn from their errors and write more structured and persuasive legal texts. We conducted a field experiment in a law course to analyse the impact of formative feedback on the exam results of 43 law students, as well as on the writer (students), the writing product and the writing process. In the control group, students received feedback conforming to the legal common practice, where they solved legal problems and subsequently received general feedback from a lecturer based on a sample solution. Students in the treatment group were provided with formative feedback that specifically targeted their individual errors, thereby stimulating internal cognitive processes within the students. Our investigation revealed that participants who were provided with formative feedback rooted in their errors within structured and persuasive legal writing outperformed the control group in producing qualitative, better legal text during an exam. Furthermore, the analysed qualitative student statements also suggest that formative feedback promotes students' self-efficacy and self-regulated learning. Our findings indicate that integrating formative feedback rooted in individual errors enhances students' legal writing skills. This underscores the hybrid nature of AI, empowering students to identify their errors and improve in a more self-regulated manner. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Collaboration between humans and AI in educational settings advances learning mutually, fostering a unified developmental process. Collaborative education models advocate leveraging human and AI strengths for adaptive learning. Despite abundant theoretical research, empirical studies in HI remain limited. This gap underscores the need for more evidence-based approaches in integrating AI into educational settings. What this paper adds Field experiment investigating the impact of formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment based on the theory of learning from errors. Comparison of a traditional legal learning environment (lecturer teaching using sample solutions) versus formative feedback in a hybrid intelligence learning environment. Implementing formative machine learning-based feedback supports law students in producing more structured and persuasive legal texts, leading to enhanced exam performance and higher grades. Implications for practice and/or policy Our research contributes significantly to computer-based education by presenting empirical evidence of how formative writing feedback impacts students' legal knowledge and skills in educational settings. This underscores the importance of incorporating empirical data into the development of AI-based educational tools to ensure their effectiveness. By focusing on individual errors corrected by formative feedback, we contribute to the learning from errors literature stream. This perspective offers valuable insights into how such feedback can support students' writing and learning processes, filling a gap in empirical evidence. Our findings demonstrate the potential impact of ML-based learning systems, particularly in large-scale learning environments like legal mass lectures. Formative writing feedback emerges as a scalable and beneficial addition to traditional learning environments, triggering internal learning processes, fostering self-regulated learning and increasing self-efficacy among students. By demonstrating the effectiveness of formative feedback within the framework of HI, particularly in legal education, our research underscores the potential of combining human understanding with AI-supported feedback to enhance learning outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Causality is a feature in a socio-economical context rapidly moving towards an ethical use of robust artificial intelligence. The primary link between causation and argumentation, especially in AI, stems from the fundamental role of causality in explanations, as argued in several works in the explainable artificial intelligence literature. In this sense, theories of causation naturally sug-gest themselves as an essential component of explainable artificial intelligence. Causality also directly supports what-if and counterfactual reasoning, fundamental components for fair, robust, and resilient use of artificial intelligence tools and systems. Because of its connection with the enquiry, persuasion, and negotiation monologues and dialogues, this article popularizes the fundamental concepts of causality for the computational argumentation research community. It also accounts for the approaches to address research questions at the heart of both argumentation and causality communities, including the connections between causal models and formal argumentation approaches. © 2025, College Publications.

AB  - Content Warning: This paper presents textual examples that may be offensive or upsetting.Large language model-based AI companions are increasingly viewed by users as friends or romantic partners, leading to deep emotional bonds. However, they can generate biased, discriminatory, and harmful outputs. Recently, users are taking the initiative to address these harms and re-align AI companions. We introduce the concept of user-driven value alignment, where users actively identify, challenge, and attempt to correct AI outputs they perceive as harmful, aiming to guide the AI to better align with their values. We analyzed 77 social media posts about discriminatory AI statements and conducted semi-structured interviews with 20 experienced users. Our analysis revealed six common types of discriminatory statements perceived by users, how users make sense of those AI behaviors, and seven user-driven alignment strategies, such as gentle persuasion and anger expression. We discuss implications for supporting user-driven value alignment in future AI systems, where users and their communities have greater agency. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The increasing prevalence of preventable chronic disease in Canada poses significant challenges to both healthcare budgets and individual financial stability. New treatments and predictive technologies are creating an urgent need to evaluate the impact of these innovations on population health and healthcare costs. This paper explores the use of system dynamics modeling to analyze the effects of artificial intelligence (AI)driven predictive tools, life-prolonging treatments, and digital behavior change applications on T2D prevalence and healthcare expenditures. Our model simulates three scenarios over a 50-year period, revealing that while AI and novel treatments can reduce complications, they may paradoxically increase T2D prevalence and overall costs unless combined with preventive measures. The study demonstrates the utility of system dynamics models in forecasting the secondary effects of policy decisions, providing policymakers with a valuable tool for evaluating trade-offs and optimizing health outcomes. The findings underscore the need for new tools to effectively manage the evolving landscape of chronic disease treatment and prevention. © 2025 The Authors.

AB  - LLM-based agents improve upon standalone LLMs, which are optimized for immediate intent-satisfaction, by allowing the pursuit of more extended objectives, such as helping users over the long term. To do so, LLM-based agents need to reason before responding. For complex tasks like personalized coaching, this reasoning can be informed by adding relevant information at key moments, shifting it in the desired direction. However, the pursuit of objectives beyond interaction quality may compromise this very quality. Moreover, as the depth and informativeness of reasoning increase, so do the number of tokens required, leading to higher latency and cost. This study investigates how an LLM-based coaching agent can adjust its reasoning depth using a discrepancy mechanism that signals how much reasoning effort to allocate based on how well the objective is being met. Our discrepancy-based mechanism constrains reasoning to better align with alternative objectives, reducing cost roughly tenfold while minimally impacting interaction quality. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The enhance of accuracy in reasoning results of LLMs arouses the community’s interests, wherein pioneering studies investigate post-hoc strategies to rectify potential mistakes. Despite extensive efforts, they are all stuck in a state of resource competition demanding significant time and computing expenses. The cause of the situation lies in the failure of identifying the fundamental feature of the solutions in this line, coined as the self-denial of LLMs. In other words, LLMs should confidently determine the potential existence of mistakes and carefully execute the targeted correction. As the whole procedure conducts within LLMs, supporting and persuasive references are hard to acquire, while the absence of specific steps towards refining hidden mistakes persists even when errors are acknowledged. In response to the challenges, we present PSSD, which refers to and implements the human psyche structure such that three distinct and interconnected roles contribute to human reasoning. Specifically, PSSD leverages the recent multi-agent paradigm, and is further enhanced with three innovatively conceived roles: (1) the intuition-based id role that provides initial attempts based on benign LLMs; (2) the rule-driven superego role that summarizes rules to regulate the above attempts, and returns specific key points as guidance; and (3) the script-centric ego role that absorbs all procedural information to generate executable script for the final answer prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed design not only better enhance reasoning capabilities, but also seamlessly integrate with current models, leading to superior performance. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - We evaluated the viability of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to trigger and personalize content in Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) in digital health. As an interaction pattern representative of context-aware computing, JITAIs are being explored for their potential to support sustainable behavior change, adapting interventions to an individual's current context and needs. Challenging traditional JITAI implementation models, which face severe scalability and flexibility limitations, we tested GPT-4 for suggesting JITAIs in the use case of heart-healthy activity in cardiac rehabilitation. Using three personas representing patients affected by CVD with varying severeness and five context sets per persona, we generated 450 JITAI decisions and messages. These were systematically evaluated against those created by 10 laypersons (LayPs) and 10 healthcare professionals (HCPs). GPT-4-generated JITAIs surpassed human-generated intervention suggestions, outperforming both LayPs and HCPs across all metrics (i.e., appropriateness, engagement, effectiveness, and professionalism). These results highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance JITAI implementations in personalized health interventions, demonstrating how generative AI could revolutionize context-aware computing. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Personalized nutrition (PN) aims to provide tailored dietary recommendations to improve a person's health outcomes by integrating a multitude of individual-level information and supporting desired behavior changes. The field is rapidly evolving with technological advances. As new biomarkers are discovered, wearables and other devices can now provide up-to-the-minute insights, and artificial intelligence and machine learning models support recommendations and lifestyle behavior change. Advancements in the field enhance the potential for tailored and effective programs but raise important questions regarding user safety, security, health, transparency, and privacy. The Personalized Nutrition Initiative at the University of Illinois held the workshop, “Challenges for Personalized Nutrition in the Current United States Regulatory Framework and Future Opportunities,” to address regulatory implications of current PN programs, future innovation within the current framework, and existing complexities of oversight. A majority of PN programs combine multiple components, and these components may need to be regulated differently. The areas of food, supplements, in vitro diagnostics, and medical and wellness devices were described and discussed as they apply to PN programs. The speakers and discussants concluded that regulatory guidance for PN programs should focus on ensuring 1) safety and accuracy of the tests and devices, 2) credentialed and skilled experts develop the advice, 3) responsible and clear communication of information and benefits, 4) substantiation of scientific claims, and 5) procedures are implemented to protect user privacy. Furthermore, as this field incorporates new devices, biomarkers, behavior-based tools, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, the need to adapt the existing regulatory framework was also considered. Working closely with regulatory bodies is required and should be an opportunity to provide users with transparency, build trust, and create a source of differentiation for PN innovators. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Purpose: To promote long-term sustainability and improve consumers’ quality of life, marketers can use artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots to initiate conversations about mindful consumption. Although anthropomorphic designs are integral for successful persuasion, there is scant research on how anthropomorphizing chatbots’ internal traits influences consumers. Integrating the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE) and the Arousal-Biased Competition (ABC) theory, this study aims to investigate how a chatbot with a higher experiential mind shapes attitudes toward mindful consumption messages by examining people’s emotional responses (i.e. eeriness and amazement) and cognitive engagement. Design/methodology/approach: Incorporating real-time interactions with a chatbot, this research adopted an online experiment with a one-factor, two-condition (a higher vs a lower experiential mind) design with eeriness and amazement as parallel mediators, leading to cognitive absorption and, consequently, attitudes toward mindful consumption messages in a serial manner. Findings: This study found that a chatbot with a higher (vs lower) experiential mind simultaneously triggers higher levels of eeriness and amazement, leading to higher cognitive absorption and a more positive message attitude. Originality/value: This study expands the current anthropomorphism literature by examining the effects of imbuing nonhuman agents with an experiential mind and emphasizing a nuanced view of emotional responses to anthropomorphized chatbots. The findings contribute to establishing a theoretical link between a chatbot’s experiential mind level and persuasion outcomes, offering strategic and ethical insights for anthropomorphized AI use in sustainability marketing. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The growing sophistication of Large Language Models allows conversational agents (CAs) to engage users in increasingly personalized and targeted conversations. While users may vary in their receptiveness to CA persuasion, stylistic elements and agent personalities can be adjusted on the fly. Combined with image generation models that create context-specific realistic visuals, CAs have the potential to influence user behavior and decision making. We investigate the effects of linguistic and visual elements used by CAs on user perception and decision making in a charitable donation context with an online experiment (n=344). We find that while CA attitude influenced trust, it did not affect donation behavior. Visual primes played no role in shaping trust, though their absence resulted in higher donations and situational empathy. Perceptions of competence and situational empathy were potential predictors of donation amounts. We discuss the complex interplay of user and CA characteristics and the fine line between benign behavior signaling and manipulation. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Purpose of Review: Nocturnal enuresis (NE) is a socially isolating and distressing condition for children and their families impacting up to 20% of five year olds. While this condition often improves with age, NE has been shown to impact children’s self-concept while also contributing financial and social stress for the entire household. This review aims to illustrate important considerations for the evaluation of NE, recent developments in treatment options, and factors influencing therapeutic success. Recent Findings: Though enuresis alarms and desmopressin remain the only first line therapies, advancements are being made to improve treatment efficacy. In addition to long-standing adjunctive therapies, new and exciting options are emerging to help families address this common condition. Among these options, medical hypnotherapy may serve as a promising alternative with limited risk of side effects, while artificial intelligence presents the potential for new enuresis alarms. Summary: Treatment success of NE may be influenced by various factors requiring careful assessment of the patient and their family. These factors should be considered when discussing treatment options and the role for adjunctive therapies. Emerging therapies mentioned here, offer exciting options for families seeking effective treatment with reduced risk of side effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Online hatred has become an increasingly pervasive issue, affecting individuals and communities across various digital platforms. To combat hate speech in such platforms, counter narratives (CNs) are regarded as an effective method. In recent years, there has been growing interest in using generative AI tools to construct CNs. However, most of the generative models produce generic responses to hate speech and can hallucinate, reducing their effectiveness. To address the above limitations, we propose a counter narrative generation method that enhances CNs by providing non-aggressive, fact-based narratives with relevant background knowledge from two distinct sources, including a web search module. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics, including LLM-based measures for persuasion, factuality, and informativeness, along with human and traditional NLP evaluations. Our method significantly outperforms baselines, achieving an average factuality score of 0.915, compared to 0.741, 0.701, and 0.69 for competitive baselines, and performs well in human evaluations. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Modern artificial intelligence (AI) technology is capable of generating human sounding voices that could be used to deceive recipients in various contexts (e.g., deep fakes). Given the increasing accessibility of this technology and its potential societal implications, the present study conducted online experiments using original data to investigate the validity of AI-based voice similarity measures and their impact on trustworthiness and likability. Correlation analyses revealed that voiceprints – numerical representations of voices derived from a speaker verification system – can be used to approximate human (dis)similarity ratings. With regard to cognitive evaluations, we observed that voices similar to one’s own voice increased trustworthiness and likability, whereas average voices did not elicit such effects. These findings suggest a preference for self-similar voices and underscore the risks associated with the misuse of AI in generating persuasive artificial voices from brief voice samples. © 2025 Jaggy et al.

AB  - Background: Black birthing people are disproportionately affected by severe maternal morbidity (SMM). The MOMs Chat & Care Study (R01NR021134) is a pragmatic, randomized clinical trial designed to test the effectiveness of an integrated care model to facilitate timely, appropriate care for high-risk Black birthing people and reduce the risk for SMM. Methods: We will recruit 674 adult, English and Spanish-speaking Black birthing people who are less than 17 weeks gestational age, considered high risk based on the Obstetrics-Comorbidity Index and/or history of preeclampsia, and receive care at a Northwell Health obstetric practice. Participants will be randomized to either MOMs High Touch or Low Touch. In both intervention arms participants will receive close monitoring via chatbot technology and navigation to timely care and services by the MOMs team throughout the prenatal and postpartum periods, Fitbit to track physical activity, and bi-weekly postpartum telehealth visits up to 6-weeks postpartum. MOMs High Touch will also receive 12 bi-weekly self-management support telehealth visits during pregnancy and a home blood pressure monitor. The two arms will be compared on incidence of SMM at labor and delivery (Aim 1), SMM-related hospitalizations at 1-month and 1-year postpartum (Aim 1a), time to preeclampsia diagnosis and treatment (Aim 2), perceived social support (Aim 3), and physical activity trajectories (exploratory Aim 4). Mixed methods will be used to examine facilitators and barriers to intervention implementation (Aim 5). Conclusion: Findings from this study will inform how to feasibly implement an effective and sustainable integrated care approach to address SMM disparities.

AB  - Purpose: to identify evidence on the effectiveness of web-based interventions for lifestyle modification among women or couples of reproductive ages wishing to conceive. Methods: A systematic search was conducted in February 2023 across CENTRAL, PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Emcare, ClinicalTrials.gov, and WHO ICTRP. Data from four randomized controlled trials involving 1965 preconception women were narratively synthesized following risk of bias assessment. Interventions included a web-based conversational agent system, an email-based mobile service, and a mobile app providing lifestyle-related information. Results: Despite diverse assessment tools, benefits were observed for systolic blood pressure, serum folate levels, and physical activity. However, no significant effects were found for intake of vegetables and fruit, folic acid supplementation, smoking, alcohol consumption, waist circumference, weight, BMI, overweight status, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL, stress, depression, anxiety, or pregnancy outcomes. Conclusions: Web-based interventions show potential in improving certain health behaviors among preconception women. Further high-quality studies are needed to assess their effectiveness on a broader range of outcomes, including dietary habits, physical activity, and substance use, and to inform their integration into preconception care strategies. Registration: We registered the study protocol with PROSPERO (CRD42023488277). © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Can AI bolster state-backed propaganda campaigns, in practice? Growing use of AI and large language models has drawn attention to the potential for accompanying tools to be used by malevolent actors. Though recent laboratory and experimental evidence has substantiated these concerns in principle, the usefulness of AI tools in the production of propaganda campaigns has remained difficult to ascertain. Drawing on the adoption of generative-AI techniques by a state-affiliated propaganda site with ties to Russia, we test whether AI adoption enabled the website to amplify and enhance its production of disinformation. First, we find that the use of generative-AI tools facilitated the outlet’s generation of larger quantities of disinformation. Second, we find that use of generative-AI coincided with shifts in the volume and breadth of published content. Finally, drawing on a survey experiment comparing perceptions of articles produced prior to and following the adoption of AI tools, we show that the AI-assisted articles maintained their persuasiveness in the postadoption period. Our results illustrate how generative-AI tools have already begun to alter the size and scope of state-backed propaganda campaigns. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - This study examines the obstacles to the effectiveness of fact-checking, focusing primarily on the pervasive impact of entrenched biases. Fact-checking efforts often face resistance when linked to mistrusted sources, leading to cognitive dissonance and the rejection of messages in favor of pre-existing beliefs, a phenomenon known as motivated reasoning. This resistance hinders organizations’ ability to correct misconceptions surrounding social issues and entities. The research delves into whether non-human entities such as AI can facilitate less biased information processing due to their perceived impartiality. Applying a moderated mediation model in experimental settings, we found that labeling a source as artificial intelligence is pivotal in evaluating fact-checking. AI labels moderate the impact of partisan biases on the persuasive outcomes of fact-checks, such as message credibility and acceptance, compared to the human source. This study offers valuable insights for enhancing the effectiveness of fact-checking in the context of cognitive and psychological biases by highlighting the critical influence of information sources in reducing polarization in public perceptions of scientific issues. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Human life behavior changes after every crisis, which led to a review of existing buildings to become resilient and sustainable against epidemics, so the research problem was identified through (the absence of interaction between architecture and crises, especially 19-Covid within space). Therefore, the research aim was office buildings. The research hypothesis was "Algorithmic architecture is a new idea that protects users in office buildings, provides a preventive solution, and fights social distancing". The research adopted the method of genetic algorithms to be an essential part of the solution in times of crisis by training the algorithm around a set of laws and principles for designing local office buildings, it indicated. The results of the two models chosen in the research indicate that the dispersion of values from their arithmetic mean is equal between the conversion and probability indices and is a variance for the prediction index in the first model resulting from the algorithm. The statistics indicated that the dispersion rate was (57%), and in the second model, it was (84%). It can be concluded that algorithmic thought in architecture gave high flexibility to the designer of office buildings in choosing the best alternatives when a crisis occurs. The best can be chosen, and the recommendations were to use artificial intelligence in all design stages to generate ideas and alternatives and choose the best. © 2025 Author(s).

AB  - Despite the prevalence of sleep-tracking devices, many individuals struggle to translate data into actionable improvements in sleep health. Current methods often provide data-driven suggestions but may not be feasible and adaptive to real-life constraints and individual contexts. We present HealthGuru, a novel large language model-powered chatbot to enhance sleep health through data-driven, theory-guided, and adaptive recommendations with conversational behavior change support. HealthGuru's multi-agent framework integrates wearable device data, contextual information, and a contextual multi-armed bandit model to suggest tailored sleep-enhancing activities. The system facilitates natural conversations while incorporating data-driven insights and theoretical behavior change techniques. Our eight-week in-the-wild deployment study with 16 participants compared HealthGuru to a baseline chatbot. Results show improved metrics like sleep duration and activity scores, higher quality responses, and increased user motivation for behavior change with HealthGuru. We also identify challenges and design considerations for personalization and user engagement in health chatbots. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), some studies have explored their potential for predicting stock prices based on financial texts. However, previous research often overlooked the depth of analysis generated by LLMs, resulting in reasoning processes inferior to those of human analysts. In fundamental investing, which requires in-depth company analysis, conclusions from imperfect reasoning lack persuasiveness. In this study, inspired by the analysis process of human analysts, we propose an “Analytical Stage-Based Multi-Agent Framework” to enable LLMs to perform in-depth fundamental analysis. This framework divides the analysis into multiple stages, assigning an LLM agent to each. We enhance each agent's capabilities for its specific task through expert guidance or fine-tuning, allowing them to collectively emulate the workflow of human analysts. Furthermore, we introduce Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment, a new method for fine-tuning LLMs. This approach addresses the decline in likelihood of generating correct responses that occurs after using existing preference alignment methods. It employs an objective function with two terms: one to increase likelihood and another to preserve aligned preference. We conducted experiments using our framework to analyze company earnings releases. We evaluated the analysis quality based on comprehensiveness and logical soundness, while correctness was assessed by using stock prices as the ground truth to calculate the Matthews correlation coefficient and F1 score. Results demonstrate that even without expert guidance and fine-tuning, our multi-agent framework can enhance LLMs in both analysis quality and correctness. When combined with expert guidance and fine-tuning, the performance is further improved. © 2025

AB  - Stereotypical biases are readily acquired and expressed by generative artificial intelligence (AI), causing growing societal concern about these systems amplifying existing human bias. This concern rests on reasonable psychological assumptions, but stereotypical bias amplification during human-AI interaction relative to pre-existing baseline levels has not been demonstrated. Here, we use previous psychological work on gendered character traits to capture and control gender stereotypes expressed in character descriptions generated by Open AI's GPT3.5. In four experiments (N = 782) with a first impressions task, we find that unexplained ('black-box') character recommendations using stereotypical traits already convey a potent persuasive influence significantly amplifying baseline stereotyping within first impressions. Recommendations that are counter-stereotypical eliminate and effectively reverse human baseline bias, but these stereotype-challenging influences propagate less well than reinforcing influences from stereotypical recommendations. Critically, the bias amplification and reversal phenomena occur when GPT3.5 elaborates on the core stereotypical content, although GPT3.5's explanations propagate counter-stereotypical influence more effectively and persuasively than black-box recommendations. Our findings strongly imply that without robust safeguards, generative AI will amplify existing bias. But with safeguards, existing bias can be eliminated and even reversed. Our novel approach safely allows such effects to be studied in various contexts where gender and other bias-inducing social stereotypes operate.  © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - With the growth of AI, researchers are studying how to mitigate its environmental impact, primarily by proposing policy changes and increasing awareness among developers. However, research on AI end users is limited. Therefore, we introduce GPTFootprint, a browser extension that aims to increase consumer awareness of the significant water and energy consumption of LLMs, and reduce unnecessary LLM usage. GPTFootprint displays a dynamically updating visualization of the resources individual users consume through their ChatGPT queries. After a user reaches a set query limit, a popup prompts them to take a break from ChatGPT. In a week-long user study, we found that GPTFootprint increases people’s awareness of environmental impact, but has limited success in decreasing ChatGPT usage. This research demonstrates the potential for individual-level interventions to contribute to the broader goal of sustainable AI usage, and provides insights into the effectiveness of awareness-based behavior modification strategies in the context of LLMs. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Objective Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a global threat driven by factors such as improper antimicrobial use in humans and animals, is projected to cause 10 million annual deaths by 2050. For behavior change, public health messages must be tailored for diverse audiences. Generative AI may have the potential to create culturally and linguistically suited AMR awareness messages. This study assesses ChatGPT-4’s capability for crafting such content. Methods 4 veterinary public health professionals from diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds identified top AMR con-tributors and audiences in their countries. A fifth person developed and refined ChatGPT-4 prompts to create AMR awareness content in US English, Ukrainian, Luganda, Ugandan English, Yoruba, and Nigerian Pidgin, using behavior change models. The content was rated for accuracy, applicability, language, cultural fit, originality, clarity, persua-siveness, and overall quality. Results ChatGPT-4 created 2 content types (long and short) per language for social media, television ads, and WhatsApp. Quality ranged from poor to excellent. Shorter content outperformed longer ones. Performance varied across lan-guages, with abysmal results for Yoruba and excellent for Pidgin. Problematic issues like simplistic language and inappropriate terminology were identified. Conclusions ChatGPT-4 has the potential to generate content and training aids. However, the varied quality requires profes-sional verification. Future research should optimize prompts and incorporate expert and audience insights for better results. These preliminary findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small sample size and subjectivity. Clinical Relevance ChatGPT-4 can quickly create tailored content for global AMR awareness. More research is needed to explore generative AI for One Health messaging. © 2025 THE AUTHORS.

AB  - Despite its importance to society and many decades of research, key questions about the social and psychological processes of political persuasion remain unanswered, often due to data limitations. We propose that AI tools, specifically generative large language models (LLMs), can be used to address these limitations, offering important advantages in the study of political persuasion. In two preregistered online survey experiments, we demonstrate the potential of generative AI as a tool to study persuasion and provide important insights about the psychological and communicative processes that lead to increased persuasion. Specifically, we test the effects of four AI-generated counterattitudinal persuasive strategies, designed to test the effectiveness of messages that include customization (writing messages based on a receiver’s personal traits and beliefs), and elaboration (increased psychological engagement with the argument through interaction). We find that all four types of persuasive AI produce significant attitude change relative to the control and shift vote support for candidates espousing views consistent with the treatments. However, we do not find evidence that message customization via microtargeting or cognitive elaboration through interaction with the AI have much more persuasive effect than a single generic message. These findings have implications for different theories of persuasion, which we discuss. Finally, we find that although persuasive messages are able to moderate some people’s attitudes, they have inconsistent and weaker effects on the democratic reciprocity people grant to their political opponents. This suggests that attitude moderation (ideological depolarization) does not necessarily lead to increased democratic tolerance or decreased affective polarization. Copyright © 2025 the Author(s).

AB  - With the widespread application of artificial intelligence in the service industry, understanding consumers’ changing attitudes towards AI is crucial. This study explores the impact of AI immorality on the shift from “love-becomes-hate” in consumers, using three scenario-based experiments and framed within the theoretical perspective of the Relationships Breakdown model. In Study 1, cognitive dissonance and perceived betrayal were found to mediate the relationship between AI immorality and the “love-becomes-hate” transition. Studies 2 and 3 further demonstrated that technological mindfulness positively moderated the relationship between AI immorality and cognitive dissonance (Study 2). Specifically, consumers with high levels of technological mindfulness experienced more pungent cognitive dissonance when confronted with AI immorality. Additionally, social judgment positively moderated the relationship between AI immorality and perceived betrayal, with negative social judgment exacerbating the degree of perceived betrayal (Study 3). Overall, AI immorality can lead to a “love-becomes-hate” phenomenon among consumers. This study theoretically fills the gap in the mechanism of AI immorality impact on consumer psychology, expands the application field of the relationship breakdown model, and deepens the understanding of consumer emotional transformation; in practice, it provides enterprises, AI developers, and marketers with an important guide for risk control of AI ethical development, which helps to maintain good human-machine relationship and brand image. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A growing body of research suggests that the recent generation of large language model (LLMs) excel, and in many cases outpace humans, at writing persuasively and empathetically, at inferring user traits from text, and at mimicking human-like conversation believably and effectively—without possessing any true empathy or social understanding. We refer to these systems as “anthropomorphic conversational agents” to aptly conceptualize the ability of LLM-based systems to mimic human communication so convincingly that they become increasingly indistinguishable from human interlocutors. This ability challenges the many efforts that caution against “anthropomorphizing” LLMs, attaching human-like qualities to nonhuman entities. When the systems themselves exhibit human-like qualities, calls to resist anthropomorphism will increasingly fall flat. While the AI industry directs much effort into improving the reasoning abilities of LLMs—with mixed results—the progress in communicative abilities remains underappreciated. In this perspective, we aim to raise awareness for both the benefits and dangers of anthropomorphic agents. We ask: should we lean into the human-like abilities, or should we aim to dehumanize LLM-based systems, given concerns over anthropomorphic seduction? When users cannot tell the difference between human interlocutors and AI systems, threats emerge of deception, manipulation, and disinformation at scale. We suggest that we must engage with anthropomorphic agents across design and development, deployment and use, and regulation and policy-making. We outline in detail implications and associated research questions. Copyright © 2025 the Author(s).

AB  - In the now intensely competitive commercial world, where the attention of the consumer is heavily sought out but a fleeting treasure, advertising has transformed from simply promoting a product. It has shifted into an art form where persuasive storytelling intertwines with marketing one's product. Consumers these days are savvier and bolder. They demand more than information; they demand emotions that reflect their aspirations. The advertising campaigns that are the most memorable and impactful are those that skillfully appeal to the emotions of their target audience. Such campaigns ensure lasting brand loyalty and provoke sustainable behavioural change. But, the shifting of the advertising world has largely changed during this period, owing to Artificial Intelligence (AI). The complicated and complex understanding of humans' underlying motivations, empathizing, and inspiration were all parts of human craftsmanship, but now these resources are altered, supplemented or challenged on many levels by algorithms. © 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

AB  - This work aims to design and validate an innovative hybrid framework that combines the Support Vector Machine (SVM) for the precise identification of exercise addiction with personalized interventions based on Reinforcement Learning (RL). This approach effectively addresses the growing issue of exercise addiction and fosters the development of healthy exercise habits in individuals. 100 participants are recruited, and high-quality data, including physical activity levels and heart rate, are obtained through collaboration with a fitness tracker manufacturer. Additionally, a self-report questionnaire is designed to gather information on participants’ exercise habits and psychological states, and medical records are integrated to enhance the data comprehensiveness. The SVM model is adopted to classify and identify exercise addiction behaviors, achieving high-precision individual state assessments. Later, based on the identification results, this work develops an intelligent recommendation system based on RL to dynamically adjust and personalize intervention strategies. The results reveal that the intervention led to a significant 35.9% reduction in weekly excessive exercise hours, demonstrating the effectiveness of the measures in curbing excessive exercise behavior. Additionally, the number of self-reported rest days increases from 0.8 to 2.1 days, marking a 162.5% rise. This demonstrates that individuals begin to prioritize rest and recovery, which is crucial for preventing exercise addiction. This work not only provides a new technical means for the early identification of exercise addiction, but also highlights the substantial potential of artificial intelligence in fostering healthy behavior changes. © 2025 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - The Pillar Theory of Law posits that the core of law is divided into two pillars: logic and morality, with justice acting as a pendulum that swings between them. The pendulum comes to rest when a balance between logic and morality is achieved. Thus, justice is realized when there is stability between logic and morality, as justice is inherently dynamic and functional. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an output of logic, while ethics is an output of morality. Philosophers universally agree that the law must evolve in line wi th societal advancements, particularly in the realms of digital technology and the internet. The author concludes that in civil cases, a clear distinction should be made between administrative aspects and those that fall within the judge's authority to decide. Administrative aspects of a case can be fully delegated to Artificial Intelligence, enabling swift resolution and achieving efficiency and effectiveness. However, in matters requiring judicial discretion, AI is unsuitable. Judges must adopt a persuasive and conciliatory approach to foster reconciliation, which represents the highest form of justice in resolving civil disputes. © 2024 Journal of Ecohumanism.

AB  - Combatting climate change requires motivating individuals to adopt climate-friendly behaviors, whether to make individual lifestyle changes, vote for environmental policy, or accept technological innovations. Efforts to promote such behaviors can be more effective when informed by theoretically and empirically driven insights into human behavior change—an endeavor led by persuasion research. This review explores the intersection of persuasion research and climate-friendly behavior, demonstrating how persuasion theory can be applied to encourage climate action. Key theoretical approaches are examined, including the theory of planned behavior, social norms, narrative-based persuasion, framing, and emotional appeals, along with considerations for their practical applications. Additionally, promising future directions for integrating persuasion research into climate change interventions are highlighted; these include tailoring messages based on moral foundations theory and the transtheoretical model, as well as leveraging artificial intelligence to personalize climate-friendly recommendations. By synthesizing insights across persuasion and environmental research, this review provides valuable guidance for environmental researchers, policymakers, intervention designers, communication strategists, and environmental activists in developing robust and effective strategies to increase climate action at a time when accelerating these behaviors is more urgent than ever. © 2025 by the author.

AB  - Integrating human support with chatbot-based behavior change interventions raises three challenges: (1) attuning the support to an individual’s state (e.g., motivation) for enhanced engagement, (2) limiting the use of the concerning human resources for enhanced efficiency, and (3) optimizing outcomes on ethical aspects (e.g., fairness). Therefore, we conducted a study in which 679 smokers and vapers had a 20% chance of receiving human feedback between five chatbot sessions. We find that having received feedback increases retention and effort spent on preparatory activities. However, analyzing a reinforcement learning (RL) model fit on the data shows there are also states where not providing feedback is better. Even this “standard” benefit-maximizing RL model is value-laden. It not only prioritizes people who would benefit most, but also those who are already doing well and want feedback. We show how four other ethical principles can be incorporated to favor other smoker subgroups, yet, interdependencies exist. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - ChatGPT has created considerable anxiety among teachers concerned that students might turn to large language models (LLMs) to write their assignments. Many of these models are able to create grammatically accurate and coherent texts, thus potentially enabling cheating and undermining literacy and critical thinking skills. This study seeks to explore the extent LLMs can mimic human-produced texts by comparing essays by ChatGPT and student writers. By analyzing 145 essays from each group, we focus on the way writers relate to their readers with respect to the positions they advance in their texts by examining the frequency and types of engagement markers. The findings reveal that student essays are significantly richer in the quantity and variety of engagement features, producing a more interactive and persuasive discourse. The ChatGPT-generated essays exhibited fewer engagement markers, particularly questions and personal asides, indicating its limitations in building interactional arguments. We attribute the patterns in ChatGPT’s output to the language data used to train the model and its underlying statistical algorithms. The study suggests a number of pedagogical implications for incorporating ChatGPT in writing instruction. © 2025 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Persuasion, as one of the crucial abilities in human communication, has garnered extensive attention from researchers within the field of intelligent dialogue systems. Developing dialogue agents that can persuade others to accept certain standpoints is essential to achieving truly intelligent and anthropomorphic dialogue systems. Benefiting from the substantial progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), dialogue agents have acquired an exceptional capability in context understanding and response generation. However, as a typical and complicated cognitive psychological system, persuasive dialogue agents also require knowledge from the domain of cognitive psychology to attain a level of human-like persuasion. Consequently, the cognitive strategy-enhanced persuasive dialogue agent (defined as CogAgent), which incorporates cognitive strategies to achieve persuasive targets through conversation, has become a predominant research paradigm. To depict the research trends of CogAgent, in this paper, we first present several fundamental cognitive psychology theories and give the formalized definition of three typical cognitive strategies, including the persuasion strategy, the topic path planning strategy, and the argument structure prediction strategy. Then we propose a new system architecture by incorporating the formalized definition to lay the foundation of CogAgent. Representative works are detailed and investigated according to the combined cognitive strategy, followed by the summary of authoritative benchmarks and evaluation metrics. Finally, we summarize our insights on open issues and future directions of CogAgent for upcoming researchers. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Dementia is a syndrome characterised by the development of multiple cognitive deficits and behavioural changes that significantly interfere with various aspects of life. The study aims to discuss capacity, competence and autonomy in individuals with dementia, and some ethical challenges related to these concepts, such as healthcare decision-making capacity, financial capacity, driving and voting. Secondarily, we aim to discuss a new ethical issue emerging from using artificial intelligence and machine learning to improve autonomy in individuals with dementia. Furthermore, we will discuss the ethical importance of obtaining informed consent for healthcare decision-making and Advance Care Planning in dementia patients. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the complex issues related to autonomy and competence in individuals with dementia, highlighting the importance of striking a balance between upholding individual rights and protecting the well-being of those affected by the disease. In conclusion, the study emphasizes the importance of Advance Care Planning in helping patients, families, caregivers, and healthcare professionals address ethical issues related to autonomy, capacity, and competence in dementia care. © 2025, Universidad de Chile - Centro Interdisciplinario de Estudios en Bioetica.

AB  - This essay examines the communicative implications of generative AI through a rhetorical lens. Rather than asking whether machines can truly ‘think,’ this approach considers how generative AI’s probabilistic outputs construct persuasive textual ‘surfaces’ that interact rhetorically with human communication. Authorship and meaning are no longer localized to a single individual creator but emerge through the interplay of human and machine co-construction of ‘possible worlds.’ By viewing generative AI as a ‘techné’ in the classical sense, we examine how models ‘imitate’ prior texts through algorithmic recombination. As AI accelerates information flows, it becomes increasingly important for individuals to develop rhetorical literacy, to deconstruct the interests and values encoded in AI’s persuasive surfaces. In contrast to the influential but one-directional information-theoretical communication model proposed by Shannon (1948), the essay advocates a rhetorical model of communication that emphasizes the active role of readers in reconstructing possible worlds from textual offers. Rather than neutral vessels of truth, generative AI outputs are inherently contingent yet interest-driven, requiring enhanced communicative competencies to navigate their impacts on changing concepts of reality, authorship, and common ground. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) show emergent patterns that mimic human cognition. We explore whether they also mirror other, less deliberative human psychological processes. Drawing upon classical theories of cognitive consistency, two preregistered studies tested whether GPT-4o changed its attitudes toward Vladimir Putin in the direction of a positive or negative essay it wrote about the Russian leader. Indeed, GPT displayed patterns of attitude change mimicking cognitive dissonance effects in humans. Even more remarkably, the degree of change increased sharply when the LLM was offered an illusion of choice about which essay (positive or negative) to write, suggesting that GPT-4o manifests a functional analog of humanlike selfhood. The exact mechanisms by which the model mimics human attitude change and self-referential processing remain to be understood. © 2025 National Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disorder, which causes memory loss and loss of cognitive functioning, along with behavioral changes. Early detection is important to delay disease progression, timely intervention and to increase patients’ and caregivers’ quality of life (QoL). One of the major and primary challenges for preventing any disease is to identify the disease at the initial stage through a quick and reliable detection process. Different researchers across the world are still working relentlessly, coming up with significant solutions. Artificial intelligence-based solutions are putting great importance on identifying the disease efficiently, where deep learning with medical imaging is highly being utilized to develop disease detection frameworks. In this work, a novel and optimized detection framework has been proposed that comes with remarkable performance that can classify the level of Alzheimer’s accurately and efficiently. Methods: A powerful vision transformer model (ViT-B16) with three efficient Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models (VGG19, ResNet152V2, and EfficientNetV2B3) has been trained with a benchmark dataset, ‘OASIS’, that comes with a high volume of brain Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). Results: A weighted average ensemble technique with a Grasshopper optimization algorithm has been designed and utilized to ensure maximum performance with high accuracy of 97.31%, precision of 97.32, recall of 97.35, and F1 score of 0.97. Conclusions: The work has been compared with other existing state-of-the-art techniques, where it comes with high efficiency, sensitivity, and reliability. The framework can be utilized in IoMT infrastructure where one can access smart and remote diagnosis services. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: In the field of bibliometrics, although some studies have conducted literature reviews and analyses on sepsis, these studies mainly focus on specific areas or technologies, such as the relationship between the gut microbiome and sepsis, or immunomodulatory treatments for sepsis. However, there are still few studies that provide comprehensive bibliometric analyses of global scientific publications related to AI in sepsis research. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the global trend analysis of AI applications in sepsis based on publication output, citations, co-authorship between countries, and co-occurrence of author keywords Methods: A total of 4,382 papers published from 2015 to December 2024 were retrieved and downloaded from the Science Citation Index Expanded database in Web of Science. After selecting the document types as articles and reviews, and conducting eligibility checks on titles and abstracts, the final bibliometric analysis using VOSviewer and CiteSpace included 4,209 papers. Results: The number of published papers increased sharply starting in 2021, accounting for 58.14% (2,447/4,209) of all included papers. The United States and China together account for approximately 60.16% (2,532/4,209) of the total publications. Among the top 10 institutions in AI research on sepsis, seven are located in the United States. Rishikesan Kamaleswaran is the most contributing author, with PLOS ONE having more citations in this field than other journals. SCIENTIFIC REPORTS is also the most influential journal (NP = 106, H-index = 23, IF: 3.8). Conclusion: This study highlights the popular areas of AI research, provides a comprehensive overview of the research trends of AI in sepsis, and offers potential collaboration and future research prospects. To make AI-based clinical research sufficiently persuasive in sepsis practice, collaborative research is needed to improve the maturity and robustness of AI-driven models. © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - A multi-stage persuasion-forecasting tournament asked specialists and generalists (“superforecasters”) to explain their probability judgments of short- and long-run existential threats to humanity. Specialists were more pessimistic, especially on long-run threats posed by artificial intelligence (AI). Despite incentives to share their best arguments during four months of discussion, neither side materially moved the other's views. This would be puzzling if participants were Bayesian agents methodically sifting through elusive clues about distant futures but it is less puzzling if participants were boundedly rational agents searching for confirmatory evidence as the risks of embarrassing accuracy feedback receded. Consistent with the latter mechanism, strong AI-risk proponents made particularly extreme long- but not short-range forecasts and over-estimated the long-range AI-risk forecasts of others. We stress the potential of these methods to inform high-stakes debates, but we acknowledge limits on what even skilled forecasters can achieve in anticipating rare or unprecedented events. © 2024 International Institute of Forecasters

AB  - In the post-truth age, political conspiracies circulate rapidly on social media, cultivating false narratives, while challenging the public’s ability to distinguish truth from fiction. ‘Deepfakes’ represent the most recent type of misinformation. They display deceitful representations of events to lead audiences to believe in fabricated realities. There has been limited research on deepfakes in political communications. As this technology progresses, deepfakes look deceptively authentic; thus, it is necessary to explore their effects on public perceptions. This study examines viewers’ comments on an Instagram-published deepfake video of Hillary Clinton to understand the impact of this technology. The results demonstrate that individuals struggle to identify deepfake videos and that their opinions are affected by this persuasive type of misinformation. This study also explores different ethical concerns posed by political deepfakes. By offering insights into public reactions to manipulated content, this study contributes to our understanding of the political effects of AI-fabricated content. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - People often find it difficult to turn their intentions into real actions—a challenge that affects both personal growth and mental well-being. While established methods like cognitive-behavioral therapy and mindfulness training help people become more aware of their behaviors and set clear goals, these approaches cannot provide immediate guidance when people fall into automatic reactions or habits. We introduce Mirai, a novel wearable AI system with an integrated camera, real-time speech processing, and personalized voice-cloning to provide proactive and contextual nudges for positive behavior change. Mirai continuously monitors and analyzes the user’s environment to anticipate their intentions, generating contextually-appropriate responses delivered in the user’s own cloned voice. We demonstrate the application of Mirai through three scenarios focusing on dietary choices, work productivity, and communication skills. We also discuss future work on improving the proactive agent via human feedback and the need for a longitudinal study in naturalistic settings. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this study, we address these challenges by proposing a Lane Change-Large Language Model (LC-LLM), an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information as natural language prompts for LLMs and employing supervised fine-tuning to tailor LLMs specifically for lane change prediction task. Additionally, we finetune the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to improve prediction transparency and reliability, and include explanatory requirements in the prompts during the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM not only predicts lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides CoT reasoning and explanations for its predictions, enhancing its interpretability. Extensive experiments based on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can effectively encode comprehensive interaction information for understanding driving behavior. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - With the development of automatic control and artificial intelligence technology, autonomous vehicles (AVs) are becoming more and more intelligent. However, this individual intelligence means that the driving behavior of AVs can be more aggressive and selfish. To investigate the impact of the selfish driving behavior of AVs on the characteristics of mixed traffic flow, this paper proposes a cellular automata model that considers the selfish driving behavior of AVs. First, we analyze the vehicle types‌ in the current mixed traffic flow and develop a universal safety distance model. Then, based on this, a cellular automata model is proposed. This model can not only describe the longitudinal car-following and lateral lane-changing behavior of human-driven vehicles and AVs, but also characterize the selfish degree in the driving behavior of AVs. Finally, simulation experiments are designed to analyze the impact of the selfish driving behavior of AVs on the performance indicators of mixed traffic flow. The results show that: (1) The increase in the penetration rate of AVs has a positive effect on the average velocity, traffic stability, and throughput of mixed traffic flow; (2) On the whole, the selfish lane-changing behavior of AVs has a relatively small impact on the average velocity of mixed traffic flow. The impact becomes smaller with the increase in traffic density. (3) In most scenarios, the selfish car-following behavior of AVs has an improving effect on the average velocity and throughput of mixed traffic flow. In summary, the relevant research results can provide theoretical support for the design of micro-behavioral control schemes for AVs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With the rapid advancement of intelligent connected vehicles (ICVs) technology, efficient and safe vehicular lane-changing decisions have become a focal point of interest for intelligent transportation systems (ITS). This paper investigates the application of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques to deep reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically deep Q-networks (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), for lane-changing decisions in industrial internet of things (IIoT) vehicles. By integrating innovative reward functions, the study assesses the performance differences between these models under various traffic densities and ICV counts in a three-lane highway scenario. The use of XAI feature representations enhances the transparency and interpretability of the models, providing insights into the decision-making process. XAI helps to elucidate how the models arrive at their decisions, improving trust and reliability in automated systems. The research reveals that although the DQN model demonstrates initial superior performance in the early phases of experimentation, the DDPG model outperforms in crucial performance metrics such as average fleet speed, headway, and stability during later stages of training. The DDPG model maintains better control over fleet speed and vehicle spacing in both low-density and high-density traffic environments, showcasing its superior adaptability and efficiency. These findings highlight the DDPG model's enhanced capability to manage dynamic and complex driving environments, attributed to its refined policy learning approach which adeptly balances exploration and exploitation. The novel reward function significantly promotes cooperative lane-changing behaviors among ICVs, optimizing lane change decisions and improving overall traffic flow efficiency. This study not only provides valuable technical support for lane-changing decisions in smart vehicular networks but also lays a theoretical and empirical foundation for the advancement of future ITS. The insights gained from comparing DQN and DDPG models contribute to the ongoing discussion on effective deep learning strategies for real-world ITS applications, potentially guiding future developments in autonomous driving technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article highlights the importance of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) in preparing students for careers in AI- driven industries by outlining methods to enhance students' Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy. The article finds major gaps in the current TVET curriculum, which do not adequately address the demands of vocational students by combining AI principles and practical applications. To address this issue, the authors suggest a curriculum design framework that incorporates AI literacy modules linked to employability skills to ensure their relevance and usefulness. To determine the long- term impact of AI literacy programs on job readiness, this chapter suggests looking at how well teacher training programs scale AI literacy projects and how creative AI technologies can improve learning outcomes. This article persuasively advocates for the integration of AI into vocational education, enabling students to acquire the necessary skills in a world where AI is becoming increasingly significant. © 2025, IGI Global Scientific Publishing.

AB  - Recent advancements in proactive dialogues have garnered significant attention, particularly for more complex objectives (e.g. emotion support and persuasion). Unlike traditional task-oriented dialogues, proactive dialogues demand advanced policy planning and adaptability, requiring rich scenarios and comprehensive policy repositories to develop such systems. However, existing approaches tend to rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) for user simulation and online learning, leading to biases that diverge from realistic scenarios and result in suboptimal efficiency. Moreover, these methods depend on manually defined, context-independent, coarse-grained policies, which not only incur high expert costs but also raise concerns regarding their completeness. In our work, we highlight the potential for automatically discovering policies directly from raw, real-world dialogue records. To this end, we introduce a novel dialogue policy planning framework, LDPP. It fully automates the process from mining policies in dialogue records to learning policy planning. Specifically, we employ a variant of the Variational Autoencoder to discover fine-grained policies represented as latent vectors. After automatically annotating the data with these latent policy labels, we propose an Offline Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithm in the latent space to develop effective policy planning capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that LDPP outperforms existing methods on two proactive scenarios, even surpassing ChatGPT with only a 1.8-billion-parameter LLM.

AB  - This study investigates the heat transfer dynamics and phase change behavior of Lauric acid in different Phase Change Material (PCM) enclosure configurations during the melting process. Four enclosure designs are analyzed: a rectangular enclosure and three enclosures with inclined walls at angles of 30°, 45°, and 60°. A constant temperature of 70 °C is applied to the right wall, with temperature propagation and liquid fraction evolution monitored. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, specifically artificial neural networks (ANN) trained using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, are utilized to model and predict the liquid fraction for Case 01, demonstrating the robustness and precision of the proposed solutions. Results indicate that the rectangular enclosure (Case 01) has the longest melting time (11,040 s) and the highest heat storage values, with sensible heat at 64.8KJ and total heat storage at 191.5KJ. Inclined enclosures reduce melting times: 30° (Case 02) achieves 9200 s (16.66 % time saving), 45° (Case 03) reduces further to 8440 s (23.55 % time saving), and 60° (Case 04) reaches 8200 s (25.72 % time saving). Increased inclinations enhance convection currents, accelerating heat transfer and melting. However, these reductions in melting time led to decreased heat storage, with Case 04 having the lowest values (62.41KJ sensible heat and 189.11KJ total heat). Economic analysis, based on the cost-effectiveness metric (Pc), reveals that Case 03 demonstrates the highest economic performance (Pc = 2.66), balancing optimal melting time with high total energy storage. These findings underscore that modifying PCM enclosure shapes enhances both thermal and economic efficiency, highlighting the importance of integrating AI-based modeling with geometric optimization for superior Thermal Energy Storage (TES) system design. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Argumentation is an omnipresent rudiment of daily communication and thinking. The ability to form convincing arguments is not only fundamental to persuading an audience of novel ideas but also plays a major role in strategic decision making, negotiation, and constructive, civil discourse. However, humans often struggle to develop argumentation skills, owing to a lack of individual and instant feedback in their learning process, because providing feedback on the individual argumentation skills of learners is timeconsuming and not scalable if conducted manually by educators. Grounding our research in social cognitive theory, we investigate whether dynamic technology-mediated argumentation modeling improves students’ argumentation skills in the short and long term. To do so, we built a dynamic machine-learning (ML)–based modeling system. The system provides learners with dynamic writing feedback opportunities based on logical argumentation errors irrespective of instructor, time, and location. We conducted three empirical studies to test whether dynamic modeling improves persuasive writing performance more so than the benchmarks of scripted argumentation modeling (H1) and adaptive support (H2). Moreover, we assess whether, compared with adaptive support, dynamic argumentation modeling leads to better persuasive writing performance on both complex and simple tasks (H3). Finally, we investigate whether dynamic modeling on repeated argumentation tasks (over three months) leads to better learning in comparison with static modeling and no modeling (H4). Our results show that dynamic behavioral modeling significantly improves learners’ objective argumentation skills across domains, outperforming established methods like scripted modeling, adaptive support, and static modeling. The results further indicate that, compared with adaptive support, the effect of the dynamic modeling approach holds across complex (large effect) and simple tasks (medium effect) and supports learners with lower and higher expertise alike. This work provides important empirical findings related to the effects of dynamic modeling and social cognitive theory that inform the design of writing and skill support systems for education. This paper demonstrates that social cognitive theory and dynamic modeling based on ML generalize outside of math and science domains to argumentative writing. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Empathy-driven design is increasingly recognized as a key element in behavior change interventions. However, self-conscious emotions such as guilt, shame, embarrassment, and pride are often overlooked. We introduce ZzzMate, an empathetic chatbot designed to detect and address these emotions to support healthy sleep routines. ZzzMate incorporates a novel emotion detection model that identifies self-conscious emotions from user interactions, which then informs a large language model (LLM) to generate empathetic responses. The system combines detected emotions with users’ sleep goals and empathy strategies to provide personalized interventions. In a comparative pilot study against a standard GPT, ZzzMate demonstrated better performance in emotional intelligence, self-efficacy and sleep adherence. This late-breaking-work presents our initial findings and system design of ZzzMate, laying the groundwork for future research in self-conscious emotion-aware health intervention technologies. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Declining acceptance of vaccinations poses a severe challenge to public health. This study delves into the effectiveness of online dialogue in shaping vaccination attitudes amidst this concerning trend. In today's digital age, utilizing the Internet for public health interventions seems crucial. We developed the FLORA application to engage users in health discussions through a conversational agent and tested it in two experiments. The first (N = 903) assessed the impact of online dialogue on vaccine willingness, while the second (N = 870) included a direct vaccination request. The results revealed a noticeable increase in vaccination intention among participants engaged in the interactive dialogue ending with a request. These findings highlight the potential of online dialogue to convey information about vaccines and support healthcare efforts effectively. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence have permeated the adoption of avatars in marketing, prompting human celebrities to create virtual representations of themselves in the cyber environment or the Metaverse as an advertising strategy. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence that explicitly substantiates the efficacy of celebrities’ avatars in comparison to human beings and other virtual celebrities. Through five studies (comprising one eye-tracking analysis and four online experiments), we find that human celebrities and their avatars can be equally persuasive. Notably, the indirect effect between the endorser type and consumer attitude via perceived novelty is more pronounced when the psychological distance between the consumer and the human celebrity is distal, resulting in greater enjoyment of the advertisements. This research improves the understanding of avatar endorsement and underscores the competitive nature of avatars, which maintain marketing efficacy comparable to that of human celebrities while appealing to consumers through novelty attributes. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this review we evaluate the applications of self-determination theory (SDT) research to promote motivation for physical activity (PA) and exercise. The evidence suggests that SDT-informed interventions are often effective at changing health behaviors, including PA/exercise, and associated health outcomes. The effect sizes are small to moderate and are often mediated by increases in autonomous motivation (primarily), interpersonal support for basic psychological needs, and competence need satisfaction. We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA. Our review also provides future conceptual and methodological directions for SDT-based research, building on advances in technology (e.g., generative Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models) and the broader field of behavioral science (e.g., optimization designs, system-level interventions, behavior change intervention ontologies). © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) is a relentless progressive brain disorder caused by the persistent presence of mutated measles virus in the central nervous system. The disease typically develops years after primary measles infection, with the highest risk observed in children infected before the age of 2 years. The global incidence of SSPE is notably higher in low- and middle-income countries and in regions with low measles vaccination coverage. The pathogenesis of SSPE involves viral persistence through mutations in viral proteins, enabling immune evasion and cell-to-cell propagation within the brain. Neuroinflammation, immune-mediated damage, and neuronal loss further contribute to disease progression. Clinical manifestations range from progressive cognitive decline and behavioral changes, along with myoclonus, seizures, movement disorders, visual impairment, and, finally, a vegetative state. Diagnosis is confirmed through cerebrospinal fluid analysis showing elevated antimeasles antibodies, characteristic periodic electroencephalography discharges, and neuroimaging findings like white matter hyperintensities and cerebral atrophy. Treatment remains challenging, with isoprinosine, interferon-α, ribavirin, and newer agents like favipiravir and aprepitant offering new hope. Symptomatic management and palliative care are needed in all patients. SSPE is invariably fatal. Notably, reports of prolonged survival and disease stabilization have been documented, particularly with early and combined therapy. The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic's adverse impact on measles vaccination rates highlights the urgent need for robust measles immunization campaigns. Future directions involve exploring antiviral fusion peptide inhibitors and artificial intelligence-driven diagnostic tools to improve early detection, treatment efficacy, and outcome prediction in SSPE.  © 2025 Annals of Indian Academy of Neurology.

AB  - Effective management of indoor environments requires a comprehensive evaluation of health, energy consumption, and thermal comfort. However, real-time assessment of these factors is challenging due to the lack of integrated applications that combine IoT technology, real-time simulation, and user-friendly interfaces for communication. To address these challenges, this research introduces a novel platform specifically designed to manage health, energy consumption, and thermal comfort in smart buildings, leveraging IoT-based building information modeling (BIM), cloud computing, and an AI-powered conversational suggestion system based on the large language model (GPT). The platform integrates real-time monitoring, simulation, alerting, and persuasion capabilities to manage health, energy consumption, and thermal comfort, enabling responsive building environment controls by assessing tradeoffs among these dimensions and providing timely recommendations. Additionally, it employs persuasive techniques to encourage occupants to adopt environmentally-friendly practices. A case study in a university building demonstrated the platform's functionality and visualization capability. A survey assessing the persuasive system revealed high adoption rates—95.59 % for switching rooms to improve indoor air quality and health, and 79.90 % for adjusting clothing to enhance thermal comfort—indicating strong participant willingness to adopt sustainable practices through the platform's strategies. The key contribution of this research is the development of a comprehensive, real-time platform that enhances indoor environmental quality and sustainability through advanced monitoring, analysis, and social interaction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Gamification and serious games are increasingly used to address sustainability challenges in the urban built environment. These innovative solutions offer interactive, experiential approaches to knowledge transfer, behaviour change and stakeholder engagement. However, research on their application remains fragmented and lacks strategic direction. There is no up-to-date, holistic insight into existing gamified interventions, the topics they explore, or their effectiveness. Given the growing interest in this field, the absence of a structured understanding leads to misaligned research and ineffective problem targeting. Furthermore, the intended purposes behind gamified approaches are not well documented. Few theoretical frameworks exist to classify expected outcomes, limiting the development of comparable, thematically interoperable gamified interventions even within a single domain. To address this, the present study conducted a systematic literature review of 133 studies, mapping thematic gaps and overrepresented areas within gamified applications in urban sustainability and circularity (excluding mobility and transportation). The analysis identified matured research areas such as energy efficiency and urban planning, while critical themes such as natural hazards remain underexplored. Following the review, the novel Three Purposes for Gamified Interventions (3P) Framework is presented, which categorises gamified interventions into three distinct purposes: Pedagogy (educational awareness), Persuasion (behavioural change), and Participation (stakeholder co-creation). By aligning themes and purposes, while being anchored in learning, behavioural, and participation frameworks, 3P provides a structured approach for purpose-driven gamified interventions. Findings reveal a thematic inclination towards certain purposes: for example, energy efficiency and circular economy gamified interventions were predominantly persuasive, while urban development ones were mostly participatory. © 2025

AB  - Generative AI tools, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), are already being extensively used by students to support their learning and it is important that educators understand what this might mean for higher education practice. In this study, two researchers external to the faculty teaching team conducted in-depth interviews with 12 students in a small European university of applied sciences who have recently undertaken programming learning as part of their undergraduate studies. The aim was to explore how these students were using LLMs to support their learning and their perceptions of its value as a learning tool. A thematic analysis of the resulting qualitative data revealed trends in the perceived advantages and disadvantages of using LLMs, as well as different levels of LLM usage, with more cautious use associated with a 'meaning-directed' approach to learning (learning pattern) and more enthusiastic and unrestrained use with 'application-directed' patterns of study. A tension was observed between some application-directed learners’ high use of LLMs and their recognition that this is not optimal for effective learning. The authors argue that Cognitive Dissonance Theory (CDT) can explain how this dissonance may motivate learners toward a dissonance-reducing attitude or behavior change. The conclusion reflects on the implications for teaching practice and offers some recommendations for how educators can increase metacognition, instrumentalize CDT to increase self-regulation, and facilitate meaning-directed learning patterns in the age of generative AI. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Persuasion plays a crucial role in human communication. Yet, convincing someone to change their mind is often challenging. Here, we demonstrate that a subtle linguistic device, generic-you (i.e., “you” that refers to people in general, e.g., “You win some, you lose some”), is associated with successfully shifting people’s pre-existing views in a naturalistic context. Leveraging Large Language Models, we conducted a preregistered study using a large (= 204,120) online debate dataset. Every use of generic-you in an argument was associated with an up to 14% percent increase in the odds of successful persuasion. These findings underscore the need to distinguish between the specific and generic uses of “you” in large-scale linguistic analyses, an aspect that has been overlooked in the literature. The robust association between generic-you and persuasion persisted with the inclusion of various covariates, and above and beyond other pronouns (i.e., specific-you, I or we). However, these findings do not imply causality. In Supplementary Experiment 2, arguments with generic-you (vs. first-person singular pronouns, e.g., I) were rated as more persuasive by open-minded individuals. In Supplementary Experiment 3, generic-you (vs. specific-you) arguments did not differentially predict attitude change. We discuss explanations for these results, including differential mechanisms, boundary conditions, and the possibility that people intuitively draw on generic-you when expressing more persuasive ideas. Together, these findings add to a growing literature on the interpersonal implications of broadening one’s perspective via a subtle shift in language, while motivating future research on contextual and individual differences that may moderate these effects. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Health self-examination, such as checking for changes to skin moles, is key to identifying potential negative changes to one's body. A major barrier to initiating a self-examination is a perceived lack of confidence or knowledge. In this study, we use a 2 × 2 between-subjects design to evaluate the effect of an AI conversational agent (CA) on participant self-efficacy and trust. We manipulated both participants' perceived skill in self-examination (based on prior perceived Success vs. Failure) and the CA's verbal persuasions (Encouraging vs. Neutral), with participants asked to complete a series of skin self-assessment tasks. Our findings show that participants' self-efficacy increased when exposed to encouraging CA persuasion. Additionally, we observed that an encouraging CA significantly increased participants' trust scores in perceived benevolence compared to a neutral-sounding CA. Our results inform the design of CAs to support users' independent self-examination. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This study investigates the impacts of the source of hotel review summary (AI-generated vs. human-generated) on customers' trust, information processing, and booking intentions through three scenario-based experiments involving 764 participants. Study 1 reveals that human-generated (vs. AI-generated) summaries lead to a higher level of trust, which boosts booking intentions. Study 2 finds that with negative reviews, there's no significant difference in booking intentions between AI and human-generated summaries, suggesting trust isn't the sole mediator. Study 3 proposes that information processing effort is a potential mediator. The findings confirm that when review valence is negative, customers invest more cognitive effort when reading AI-generated compared to human-generated summaries. The results challenge the assumption that human-generated reviews are inherently more persuasive. This research addresses critical gaps in understanding AI-generated content's impact on customer behavior in the hospitality industry, offering both theoretical contributions and practical insights for integrating AI technologies in customer communication strategies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Group decision-making often benefits from diverse perspectives, yet power imbalances and social influence can stifle minority opinions and compromise outcomes. This prequel introduces an AI-mediated communication system that leverages the Large Language Model to serve as a devil’s advocate, representing underrepresented viewpoints without exposing minority members’ identities. Rooted in persuasive communication strategies and anonymity, the system aims to improve psychological safety and foster more inclusive decision-making. Our multi-agent architecture, which consists of a summary agent, conversation agent, AI duplicate checker, and paraphrase agent, encourages the group’s critical thinking while reducing repetitive outputs. We acknowledge that reliance on text-based communication and fixed intervention timings may limit adaptability, indicating pathways for refinement. By focusing on the representation of minority viewpoints anonymously in power-imbalanced settings, this approach highlights how AI-driven methods can evolve to support more divergent and inclusive group decision-making. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The introduction of generative AI (GenAI, e.g., ChatGPT) has transformed second language (L2) writing practices. Writers need to learn how to critically employ the tools’ affordances to maximise their learning and L2 instructors face the challenge of guiding students through these novel contexts (cf. Sasaki, 2023). Also collaborative writing (CW) interventions have to find ways how to include GenAI as another technology that impacts the effectiveness of CW as an instructional L2 writing tool (cf. Storch, 2022; Su et al., 2023). In this study, we present an in-depth analysis of how GenAI influences revision and deliberation processes during CW within four writing pairs (N = 8; aged 18–23) engaging in a classroom-based intervention that tasked them to compare their own writing with GenAI models. We analysed screen recordings of evolving revision behaviours, changes in text quality as well as joint discussions among pairs. Complementing Strobl, Menke-Bazhutkina, Abel, and Michel (2024), the current paper (i) relates writers’ revision behaviour to text quality evaluated for functional adequacy (Kuiken & Vedder, 2017); and (ii) presents a fine-grained review of dialogues to identify patterns of CW revisions in interaction with GenAI models. Findings shed new light on CW models (Storch, 2009) in the digital era where GenAI is implemented in L2 writing and revision instruction. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - This study examines the use of Motivational Interviewing (MI) principles in a GPT-4-based chatbot, MIcha, to promote behaviour change. We conducted a pre-registered randomised controlled trial to assess the integration of MI techniques in conversational agents, aiming to support users’ behaviour change through guided self-reflection and identify how users interact with large language model (LLM)-based systems in this context. Results indicate that short conversations with LLM-based chatbots are successful at increasing users’ readiness to change and usage of MI principles during text generation can effectively mitigate potential harms. Additionally, we identified distinct user behaviour types — cooperative, reflective, and pre-informed—that significantly influenced the outcomes of interactions. These findings demonstrate the potential of MI principles in enhancing the efficacy of conversational agents for behaviour change and highlight the importance of user behaviour in shaping interaction dynamics. © 2025

AB  - Large language models can now generate political messages as persuasive as those written by humans, raising concerns about how far this persuasiveness may continue to increase with model size. Here, we generate 720 persuasive messages on 10 US political issues from 24 language models spanning several orders of magnitude in size. We then deploy these messages in a large-scale randomized survey experiment (N = 25,982) to estimate the persuasive capability of each model. Our findings are twofold. First, we find evidence that model persuasiveness is characterized by sharply diminishing returns, such that current frontier models are only slightly more persuasive than models smaller in size by an order of magnitude or more. Second, we find that the association between language model size and persuasiveness shrinks toward zero and is no longer statistically significant once we adjust for mere task completion (coherence, staying on topic), a pattern that highlights task completion as a potential mediator of larger models’ persuasive advantage. Given that current frontier models are already at ceiling on this task completion metric in our setting, taken together, our results suggest that further scaling model size may not much increase the persuasiveness of static LLM-generated political messages.

AB  - The rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) in our society and everyday life demonstrates the need for greater AI literacy of its potential biases and harms. Although there have been attempts to bring AI literacy to children, commonly via game-based learning, there is still a lack of instruction that aims to encourage a more nuanced understanding of the utility and harm of GenAI systems to a broader audience. To address the gap, we developed the educational game ImaginAItion, inspired by existing popular party game mechanisms such as Telestrations and Caution Signs. In particular, our game targets adults who do not have a deep understanding of GenAI. Leveraging persuasive strategies grounded in psychological theories, we seek to encourage deeper reflection on players’ GenAI prompting behaviors and their understanding of its capabilities and limitations. © 2025 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This longitudinal study investigated the managerial effectiveness of the “Magnificent Seven” stock firms in enhancing Economic Value Added (EVA) before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing a within-subject ANOVA analysis on data spanning from 2016 to 2023, this research aimed to explore how managerial decisions within these firms influenced economic profits over time. The study utilized the Stern-Stewart formula for EVA to calculate the average EVA data from 10-K filings of these technology-oriented firms, representing a significant portion of the S&P 500 index, to determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on their financial performance. Results indicated a large significant effect difference in EVA pre- and post-COVID-19 pandemic, with an increase in both the mean value and variability of EVA. The partial eta squared value indicated that the time period accounted for approximately 26.4% of the variance in EVA. This suggested that the COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on these firms’ EVA, reflecting positively on their managerial decision-making effectiveness in creating economic value. The conclusion highlighted the importance of management efficiency key decisions included leveraging artificial intelligence, maintaining operational agility to mitigate supply chain disruptions, and fostering a culture of innovation in navigating the complexities introduced by the pandemic. It underscored the significant role of external factors such as consumer behavior changes and government policies in influencing company performance. The study recommended exploring how different sectors responded to the pandemic’s challenges, particularly those hit hardest by the crisis. This study contributed to the understanding of EVA as a reliable measure of a company’s financial health and managerial effectiveness in uncertain times. © World Scientific Publishing Co. and Center for Pacific Basin Business, Economics and Finance Research.

AB  - The agricultural industries have embraced the use of technologies as they improve efficiency and food security. The pork industry is no exception to this, as monitoring techniques and artificial intelligence allow for unprecedented capacity to track the physiological and behavioural condition of individual animals. This article reviews a range of those technologies in reference to the detection of oestrus in sows, a time when the ability to precisely ascertain physiological and behavioural changes associated with fluctuating hormone levels can have an immense impact on the economic profitability of the farm. The strengths and weaknesses of each technique from a practical application perspective are discussed, followed by considerations for further research and refinement. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - The images used to depict artificial intelligence (AI) in science communication and marketing are often criticized for their stereotypical nature, yet their actual effectiveness remains an open question. Rather than reiterating existing critiques, this paper examines whether these images truly influence public perception and, if so, how different types of AI representations—particularly stock images—compare in their effectiveness. Drawing on Aristotelian rhetoric, we conceptualize effectiveness through three persuasive dimensions: logos (explanatory clarity), ethos (credibility and engagement), and pathos (emotional impact). To investigate these aspects, we conducted an experiment with 79 communication students, who were presented with three versions of the same fabricated scientific article: one without images, one with an institutional research image, and one with a stock image. The findings indicate that while stock images may reduce comprehension of technical content, they slightly enhance reader engagement. Our analysis calls for a more nuanced understanding of AI imagery, moving beyond ethical concerns to consider how these visuals shape public discourse. While stock images contribute to a standardized and sometimes misleading portrayal of AI, their rhetorical power in communication contexts should not be overlooked. The paper concludes by arguing for a more critical yet balanced approach to evaluating the role of images in AI representation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2025.

AB  - Food habits are widely acknowledged to have a major impact on health and well-being. However, changing them remains an incredibly challenging endeavor. In this paper, we present the preliminary findings of the project Promoting Healthy and Sustainable Eating through Interactive and Explainable AI Methods (PHaSE), which aims to support individuals in adopting healthier and more sustainable diets. We begin by reviewing previous efforts to design technology aimed at changing people’s food behavior. Through an analysis of 20 Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) papers, we highlight that current technologies rarely support sense-making or consider the lived experience of behavior change. Instead, they often place significant emphasis on the target behavior to be modified. Next, we recount the findings from three design workshops, where participants identified several conversational design strategies that an agent should employ to effectively influence behavior. These include showing empathy and providing suggestions that are clear, trustworthy, and actionable. Additionally, the conversational agent should offer personalized advice that accounts for individual differences, while maintaining a friendly tone and avoiding a prescriptive approach. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionise healthcare. If the implementation is successful it has the potential to improve healthcare outcomes for patients and organisations. Little is known about the perceptions of allied health professionals (AHPs) towards AI in healthcare. Objective: This study investigated barriers and enablers to AI implementation in the delivery of healthcare from the AHPs perspective. Methods: Qualitative methodology informed by behaviour change theory using focus groups with AHPs at a health service in Queensland, Australia. Results: Twenty-four barriers and 24 enablers were identified by 25 participants across four focus groups. Barriers included: lack of AI knowledge, explainability challenges, risk to professional practice, negative impact on professional practice, and role replacement. Enablers include AI training and education, regulation, reputation, understanding the healthcare benefits of AI and engaging clinical champions. Conclusions: AHPs have concerns about the impact and trustworthiness of AI and the readiness of organisations to support its use. Organisations must take a proactive approach and adopt targeted and multifaceted strategies to address barriers. This may include workforce upskilling, clear communication of the benefits of AI use of local champions and ongoing research. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - The objective was to explore New Zealand mental health clinicians’ and trainees’ knowledge, utilization, and attitudes towards digital mental health tools through semi-structured interviews. Participants were recruited from an online survey about digital mental health tools. At the survey’s conclusion, participants could express interest and provide contact details via a link. One-on-one in-depth Zoom interviews were conducted, lasting an average of 45 min each. Data collection occurred between August 2021 and February 2022. Anonymized transcripts were analyzed using reflexive thematic analysis. Seventeen clinicians took part, and four primary themes emerged: (1) receptiveness to digital innovation, most had used digital mental health tools with clients, observing beneficial outcomes and positive responses; (2) digital technology remains a double-edged sword, offering significant supportive opportunities while also highlighting the digital divide; (3) impediments to clinical implementation, stemming from concerns about maintaining clinical safety and the need to adapt beyond established comfort zones; (4) aspirations for digital technology in clinical practice, encompassing innovative ideas, desire for tools responsive to New Zealand’s diverse communities, and ideas to maximize their potential. This qualitative study gives voice to New Zealand mental health practitioners and their interest in digital innovations to improve client care. However, integrating digital mental health tools into clinical practice effectively depends on overcoming challenges like the digital divide, data privacy, safety concerns, and the lack of tools that reflect New Zealand culture or offer personalization to meet individual needs. It highlights the need for collaboration in developing and deploying digital interventions that are both aligned with clinician requirements and adapted to the specific contexts of their client communities. This research provides a historical (albeit 3-year-old) account of clinician attitudes and knowledge. Given the rapid pace of technological innovation—particularly the rise of generative AI since late 2023—taking snapshots of changing attitudes becomes ever more important as the technological landscape continues to evolve. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - There is a rising interest in chatbots dedicated to enhancing sexual health. However, there is limited research on the effectiveness of these chatbots, and the current literature lacks sufficient exploration of gaps and patterns in this field. In this review, we provided an overview of the state-of-the-art research conducted on sexual health chatbots, with the goal of identifying prevalent trends, design patterns, and features. In addition, we investigated existing research gaps, challenges, and shortcomings in the landscape of sexual health chatbots. Further, we proposed potential enhancements and directions for future research and development to create more effective chatbots in this field. A systematic search and screening of the literature from the past decade (2013–2023), extracted from seven databases, yielded a total of 1040 studies, out of which 29 articles were included in the final review following screening. The findings suggest that chatbots are usable and effective tools in sexual health education, persuasion, and assistance that are appreciated for their confidentiality, efficiency, and 24/7 availability. However, their performance is hindered by limitations such as restricted scope of knowledge and challenges in understanding user inputs. Additionally, constraints such as text-only input/output modalities and a predominant reliance on the English language limit their accessibility and acceptability. There is also a crucial need for more research in low-income or lower-middle-income countries, where individuals require increased sexual health education and support. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Smartphone apps are a growing field supporting the prevention of chronic diseases. The user experience (UX) is an important predictor of app use and should be considered in mobile health research. Long-term skin protection behavior is important for those with work-related skin diseases. However, altering health behavior is complex and requires a high level of self-management. We developed a maintenance program consisting of the Mein Hautschutz im Alltag (MiA; “My skin protection in everyday life”) app combined with an individual face-to-face goal-setting interview to support patients in the implementation of skin protection behavior after inpatient rehabilitation. Objective: The objectives of this paper are to (1) describe the intervention in a standardized manner; (2) evaluate the UX, subjective quality, and perceived impact of the MiA app; and (3) evaluate the adherence to the MiA app. Methods: We followed a user-centered and multistage iterative process in 2 steps that combined qualitative and quantitative data. The maintenance program was tested over 12 weeks after discharge from rehabilitation. The UX, subjective quality, and perceived impact were evaluated formatively based on the user version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale after 12 weeks (T2). Adherence was measured using the frequency of interactions with the app. Results: In total, 42 patients took part (with a dropout rate of n=18, 43% at T2). The average age was 49.5 (SD 13.1) years, and 57% (24/42) were male. We found high ratings for the UX, with an average score of 80.18 (SD 8.94) out of a theoretical maximum of 100, but there were a few exceptions in the usability and interaction with the app. The app was most frequently rated with 4 out of 5 stars (15/24, 65%), which indicates a high subjective quality. Furthermore, the app seemed to influence important determinants to implement skin protection behavior. Adherence to skin protection tracking was higher over the study period than adherence to skin documentation and goal assessment. The number of adherent participants to skin protection tracking was higher in the skin care and skin cleansing categories (28/42, 67% each) compared to the skin protection category (13/42, 31%) on day 1 and decreased until day 84 in all dimensions (12/42, 29% each for skin care and skin cleansing; 9/42, 21% for skin protection). Conclusions: The results in terms of adherence met the expectations and were consistent with those of other studies evaluating the use of apps for chronic diseases. Interaction with the app could be increased using artificial intelligence to determine eczema severity via photos. It should be investigated which subgroups have difficulties with usability to individualize the support to a greater degree during onboarding. There is a need for further research regarding the effectiveness of the MiA app on skin protection behavior, quality of life, and eczema severity. ©Nele Ristow, Annika Wilke, Christoph Skudlik, Swen Malte John, Michaela Ludewig.

AB  - Simply constructing a customer journey map is not enough. Customer preferences and behaviors change over time in response to emerging needs and circumstances. To ensure customer experiences are positive, companies must refresh customer journey maps. Hence, AI helps in precisely capturing customer interactions at various touchpoints, retaining up-to-date and relevant maps, and adjusting complex customer journeys. Customer journey mapping is an efficient technique that enables companies to visualize their customers’ end-to-end experiences. This research explored the impact of customer journey mapping with integrated artificial intelligence on companies to enhance customer experience and increase customer loyalty. Using AI-driven analytics, companies can effectively gather and analyze massive amounts of data from various touchpoints. Nevertheless, AI-powered customer journey mapping encourages predictive modeling, enabling companies to foresee customer behaviors. The authors used a case study methodology to collect data on three SMEs using AI support customer journey mapping. This methodology assures a comprehensive understanding of AI on customer journey mapping for academic and business audiences. Findings from the case studies illustrated the effectiveness of AI in optimizing customer journeys. Companies implementing AI-driven CJM reported significant improvements in key performance indicators such as customer satisfaction scores, Net Promoter Scores (NPS), and customer lifetime value (CLV). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The importance of online reviews for consumers' decision-making engages fraudsters to game the review system by writing or buying fake reviews. Fake reviews are a main threat to consumers since they are hardly distinguishable from genuine human-made reviews. Moreover, advances in generative AI like ChatGPT foster the simple creation of persuasive text, such as high-quality fake reviews. While prior studies primarily focused on automatic fake review detection, little is known about how consumers react to AI-generated fake reviews. Based on a quantitative-qualitative study with 151 consumers (906 review classifications), we found that humans cannot reliably distinguish between genuine and AI-generated fake reviews (accuracy= 53.2%). They are especially worse at detecting negative AI-generated fake reviews. Our findings extend prior research by examining consumers' ability to detect AI-generated fake reviews, identifying a set of cues they use for review classification, and investigating the cues' effectiveness for detection. Further, we derive practical implications. © 2025 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Drawing upon the influence of presumed media influence (IPMI) model, this study investigates indirect media effects on individuals' intentions to adopt generative AI technology, with a further examination of how variations in technological optimism impact the relationships within the IPMI model. Findings from a national survey of 1061 respondents confirmed the existence of presumed media influence in the context of generative AI technology, as individuals’ attention to generative AI technology related media content influenced their presumptions about how others use it, subsequently affecting their adoption intentions through social norm perception, attitude change, and the fear of missing out. Furthermore, a multigroup comparison uncovers divergent presumed media effects on generative AI technology adoption between subgroups characterized by their differing levels of technological optimism, in which high technological optimism was found to trump fear of missing out in driving its adoption. © 2024

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being applied in various health care services due to its enhanced efficiency and accuracy. As the population ages, AI-based health technologies could be a potent tool in older adults’ health care to address growing, complex, and challenging health needs. This study aimed to investigate perspectives on and acceptability of the use of AI-led health technologies among older adults and the potential challenges that they face in adopting them. The findings from this inquiry could inform the designing of more acceptable and user-friendly AI-based health technologies. Objective: The objectives of the study were (1) to investigate the attitudes and perceptions of older adults toward the use of AI-based health technologies; (2) to identify potential facilitators, barriers, and challenges influencing older adults’ preferences toward AI-based health technologies; and (3) to inform strategies that can promote and facilitate the use of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Methods: This study adopted a qualitative descriptive design. A total of 27 community-dwelling older adults were recruited from a local community center. Three sessions of semistructured interviews were conducted, each lasting 1 hour. The sessions covered five key areas: (1) general impressions of AI-based health technologies; (2) previous experiences with AI-based health technologies; (3) perceptions and attitudes toward AI-based health technologies; (4) anticipated difficulties in using AI-based health technologies and underlying reasons; and (5) willingness, preferences, and motivations for accepting AI-based health technologies. Thematic analysis was applied for data analysis. The Theoretical Domains Framework and the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model behavior change wheel were integrated into the analysis. Identified theoretical domains were mapped directly to the COM-B model to determine corresponding strategies for enhancing the acceptability of AI-based health technologies among older adults. Results: The analysis identified 9 of the 14 Theoretical Domains Framework domains—knowledge, skills, social influences, environmental context and resources, beliefs about capabilities, beliefs about consequences, intentions, goals, and emotion. These domains were mapped to 6 components of the COM-B model. While most participants acknowledged the potential benefits of AI-based health technologies, they emphasized the irreplaceable role of human expertise and interaction. Participants expressed concerns about the usability of AI technologies, highlighting the need for user-friendly and tailored AI solutions. Privacy concerns and the importance of robust security measures were also emphasized as critical factors affecting their willingness to adopt AI-based health technologies. Conclusions: Integrating AI as a supportive tool alongside health care providers, rather than regarding it as a replacement, was highlighted as a key strategy for promoting acceptance. Government support and clear guidelines are needed to promote ethical AI implementation in health care. These measures can improve health outcomes in the older adult population by encouraging the adoption of AI-driven health technologies. © Arkers Kwan Ching Wong, Jessica Hiu Toon Lee, Yue Zhao, Qi Lu, Shulan Yang, Vivian Chi Ching Hui.

AB  - Researchers have started to explore the persuasive power of large language models (LLMs) and initial results suggest that LLMs can be as persuasive as humans, even for controversial and moralized topics. We conducted a preregistered proof-of-concept study to test how a brief conversation with ChatGPT-4o influences attitudes and beliefs about meat consumption. We found that participants (n = 101) reported weaker commitment to eating meat and weaker beliefs that eating meat is necessary and natural, but not weaker beliefs that eating meat is normal or nice, after their conversation (vs. before). Our study provides preliminary evidence and can act as a blueprint for future explorations of how conversations with LLMs can change attitudes on meat consumption and related topics. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - As intelligent systems become more integrated into people’s daily life, systems designed to facilitate lifestyle and behavior change for health and well-being have also become more common. Previous work has identified challenges in the development and deployment of such AI-based support for diabetes lifestyle management and shown that it is necessary to shift the design process of AI-based support systems towards a human-centered approach that can be addressed by hybrid intelligence (HI). However, this shift also means adopting a user-centric design process, which brings its own challenges in terms of stakeholder involvement, evaluation processes and ethical concerns. In this perspective paper, we aim to more comprehensively identify challenges and future research directions in the development of HI systems for behavior change from four different viewpoints: (1) challenges on an individual level, such as understanding the individual end-user’s context (2) challenges on an evaluation level, such as evaluation pipelines and identifying success criteria and (3) challenges in addressing ethical implications. We show that developing HI systems for behavior change is an interdisciplinary process that requires further collaboration and consideration from various fields. 2025 Hao, Uusitalo, Figueroa, Smit, Strange, Chang, Ribeiro, Kouomogne Nana, Tielman and de Boer.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but are still prone to outputting falsehoods using seemingly persuasive language. Many recent works attempt to address this problem by using LLMs in a framework where a single seed prompt results in a series of interactions involving augmented prompts with an otherwise unchanged LLM, and the results are aggregated with a goal of producing a more reliable output. We consider the replicability and generalizability of evaluations of inference-time methods intended to improve the reliability of responses from base LLMs. We survey how methods have been evaluated in the literature and find a great variety of benchmarks and models in use. Motivated by this, we conduct our own evaluation to evaluate the effectiveness of a few methods across a range of benchmarks and models. We find that while these techniques show promise in improving reliability, there is still significant variability in performance across different domains and tasks, and methods that show substantial improvements on weaker base models often do not improve reliability for better base models. © 2025, Transactions on Machine Learning Research.

AB  - People often underestimate their carbon emissions, but once they become aware of the environmental impact of their actions, it can lead to significant behavioral changes. Numerous studies have highlighted the importance of improving low-carbon literacy, especially through personalized information, which is more effective in driving behavior change than generalized information. Chatbots can play a key role in delivering tailored messages, providing guidance on food choices, building materials, appliance use, transportation options (e.g., car sharing), and other behaviors that influence an individual’s carbon footprint. This study aims to develop a simple, scalable, and easily maintainable low-carbon activity database using open-source software, operating locally to reduce reliance on paid APIs. Implemented on the Ollama platform, the system can be deployed on consumer-grade computers with acceptable response times. By utilizing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, the system converts data into a vector database and uses a large language model for retrieval. Carbon emission data from four sources were used, and the system’s retrieval performance was tested with 100 prompts in English, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese. The results showed that database size had the largest impact on recall rates, especially when irrelevant or similar data were included. Model selection was also critical, particularly in multilingual contexts where proper language settings played a significant role. The study found that chunk size had a minor influence on results, but the choice of language, while important, was less critical than database size. These findings underscore the need for careful database design and model selection, especially in multilingual RAG systems, and suggest further research to address challenges like scalability and adaptation to diverse data types. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2025.

AB  - This paper proposes an innovative solution to address low literacy among adult English as a Second Language (ESL) learners by utilizing Generative AI within a personalized literacy platform. This AI-driven platform is designed to motivate and engage adult ESL learners through a multimodal, audio-visual tutoring system that tailors educational content to individual interests and learning needs. Grounded in theories of persuasive communication, neuroscience, and economics, our approach leverages established educational strategies, such as the science of reading and neuromarketing models, to enhance literacy development. The platform will implement the NeuroMap framework by Morin and Renvoisé (2018), integrating six persuasive stimuli proven to impact student motivation. These stimuli will be used to evaluate and select learning resources for initial inclusion, refining content based on their potential to engage students deeply. Our method includes eye-tracking to assess real-time engagement through perceptual “with-me-ness” measures, alongside a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)-based recommendation system to dynamically adjust content. Expected results include improved literacy rates among ESL learners, driven by personalized content that engages the primal brain, connects emotionally with users, and adapts in response to engagement and learning performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use is a major public health problem and young adults aged 18-24 years are at high risk. Furthermore, oral nicotine products (ONPs) are growing in popularity in this population. Poly-use is widespread. New methodologies for rigorous online studies using social media have been conducted and shown to reduce nicotine use. Objective: We report on the design and baseline evaluation of a large-scale social media-based randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effects of antivaping social media on young adult vaping and determinants of use. Methods: Using the Virtual Lab social media platform, participants were recruited using an artificial intelligence chatbot and social media advertising, completed a baseline survey, and were randomized to 1 of 4 study arms. The design was to achieve specific numbers of impressions per arm over 3 survey time points. We recruited 8437 participants, stratified by vaper (n=5026) and nonvaper (n=3321) status. Questionnaire data were collected using the Qualtrics survey platform. Future analyses will examine the effects of social media content on vaping at the endline. Our data analysis describes the 2 cohort samples, examines balance across the 4 study arms on baseline variables in each of the cohorts, and evaluates the internal consistency of several multi-indicator measures of psychosocial constructs. Results: Among vapers, almost three-fourths were current vapers, >40% were current smokers (using in the past 30 days), and >48% were current poly-users (using e-cigarettes and ≥1 other tobacco products). Substantial numbers of current vapers also currently use some other product, including cigars (n=1520, 30.2%), hookah (n=794, 15.8%), smokeless devices (n=462, 9.2%), and ONPs (n=578, 11.5%). The average age of participants was 21.2 (SD 2) years. Just less than 45% of participants were non-Hispanic White (n=3728, 44.7%), just less than 47% (n=3913, 46.9%) of the sample was male, more than 44% (n=3704, 44.4%) reported completing high school, and 79.3% reported meeting basic needs or better. There were no significant differences between arms and strata by any of these demographics. We calculated scale scores for depression and covariates related to nicotine use and found high alphas. Finally, participants who reported having seen antitobacco brand advertising were more likely to have higher levels of these variables and scales than participants who reported not having seen the advertisements. These results will be examined in future studies. Conclusions: Social media can be used as a platform at scale for longitudinal randomized controlled trials over extended periods, which extends previous research on short-term trials. Interventions delivered by social media can be used with large samples to evaluate social media health behavior change interventions. Future studies based on this research will evaluate the intervention and dose-response effects of social media exposure on vaping behavior and determinants. © William Douglas Evans, Megumi Ichimiya, Jeffrey B Bingenheimer, Jennifer Cantrell, Alexander P D'Esterre, Olivia Pincus, Linda Q Yu, Elizabeth C Hair.

AB  - The increasing importance of public speaking (PS) skills has fueled the development of automated assessment systems, yet the integration of large language models (LLMs) in this domain remains underexplored. This study investigates the application of LLMs for assessing PS by predicting persuasiveness. We propose a novel framework where LLMs evaluate criteria derived from educational literature and feedback from PS coaches, offering new interpretable textual features. We demonstrate that persuasiveness predictions of a regression model with the new features achieve a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.6, underperforming approach with hand-crafted lexical features (RMSE 0.51) and outperforming direct zero-shot LLM persuasiveness predictions (RMSE of 0.8). Furthermore, we find that only LLM-evaluated criteria of language level is predictable from lexical features (F1-score of 0.56), disapproving relations between these features. Based on our findings, we criticise the abilities of LLMs to analyze PS accurately. To ensure reproducibility and adaptability to emerging models, all source code and materials are publicly available on GitHub. © 2025 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - The circular economy concept has gained significant attention in the academic and industrial discourse. Yet, the widespread adoption of circular business models is still outstanding, with a lack of customer acceptance representing a critical barrier. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the potential of digital technologies to expedite the circular economy's broader implementation. This study investigates the role of digital technologies in enhancing customer acceptance of circular business models in consumer-facing industries. To extract insights from practice, we conducted 41 semi-structured interviews with experts from companies that have implemented circular economy principles, management consulting firms, and academia. As a result, we provide thematical structures of (1) 35 factors affecting customer acceptance of circular business models, (2) 36 practices that organizations can deploy to address these factors and enhance customer acceptance, and (3) 19 digital technologies to facilitate such practices. Our findings combine and extend insights from the distinct research streams of behavioral science and theory of digital technology management by adding a technology dimension to the behavior change wheel, highlighting the interplay between sources of behavior (factors), intervention functions (practices), and technological enablers (digital technologies). This extended framework will support researchers investigating the role of digital technologies and inform companies about the use of digital technologies in circular business model innovation as an enabler of customer acceptance. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - We develop an AI and AI-human-based model for salesforce hiring using recordings of conversational video interviews that involve two-sided, back-and-forth interactions with messages conveyed through multiple modalities (text, voice, and body language). We derive objective, theory-backed measures of sales performance from these modalities, leveraging recent advances in body language analysis, conversational analysis, and large language models (LLMs). These measures serve as explanatory variables in our AI model. Our key contribution to the broader research on persuasion and influence is that we show how to use conversational videos to capture features related to (i) two-way conversational interactivity; (ii) real-time adaptation; and (iii) human body language, with minimal measurement error relative to extant survey-based approaches that suffer from recall biases. We use rubric-based scores by panels of sales professionals (correlated with hiring decisions) to isolate a candidate’s “latent sales ability” and use these as outcome variables to be predicted by the AI model. The AI model achieves reasonable predictive accuracy, yet incorporating human judgments into an AI-human hybrid model enhances its effectiveness—improving workforce quality by 67% over random selection. Although the content of what is spoken is most important in prediction, conversational interactivity, sellers’ real-time adaptation to the buyer, and body language also have good explanatory power. Finally, in terms of performance-cost trade-offs, the addition of just one human professional evaluation in the hiring loop in combination with AI is optimal. Further, using human input based on only the two early stages of the interview in a task-based hybrid model is the most cost-effective in improving performance. © 2024 INFORMS.

AB  - Background: The phenomenon of procrastination refers to an individual’s conscious decision to postpone the completion of tasks despite being aware of its adverse consequences in the future. Extant research in this field shows that procrastination is associated with increased levels of anxiety and stress and the likelihood of developing depression and calls for the development of suitable interventions that support individuals in making lasting positive changes to their procrastination behaviors. In parallel, practice has produced a plethora of behavior change support systems (BCSSs) that aim to provide a low-threshold, accessible alternative to in-person therapeutic approaches. Most of these BCSSs can be considered motivational BCSSs that combine functional, utilitarian components with hedonic and eudaimonic design elements to empower self-treatment. Although early studies have suggested the potential benefits of such BCSSs, research on understanding their specific design characteristics and support of individuals in self-treating procrastination is still in its infancy. Objective: In response to this gap between practice and research, we aimed to analyze and systemize the multitude of practical design efforts in motivational BCSSs for the self-treatment of procrastination and identify the main design archetypes that have emerged. Methods: We conducted a 3-step research approach. First, we identified 127 behavior change support apps for procrastination through a systematic screening process in the German and US Apple App Store and Google Play Store. Second, we systematically coded the identified apps in terms of the behavior change techniques targeted by their functional design and hedonic or eudaimonic design elements. Third, we conducted a 2-step cluster analysis to identify archetypes of motivational design in behavior change support apps to combat procrastination. Results: A variety of motivational designs have been developed and implemented in practice, and our analysis identified five main archetypes: (1) structured progress monitor, (2) self-improvement guide, (3) productivity adventure, (4) emotional wellness coach, and (5) social focus companion. The identified archetypes target different psychological determinants of procrastination and successfully use a variety of hedonic and eudaimonic design elements that extend beyond the current state of research. Conclusions: The results of our study provide a foundation for future research endeavors that aim to examine the comparative effects of motivational design archetypes and develop more effective interventions tailored to individual needs. For practitioners, the findings reveal the contemporary design space of motivational BCSSs to support the self-treatment of procrastination and may serve as blueprints that can guide the design of future systems. For individuals seeking support and health professionals treating procrastination, our study systemizes the landscape of apps, thereby facilitating the selection of one that best aligns with the patient’s individual needs. ©Jeanine Kirchner-Krath, Manuel Schmidt-Kraepelin, Katharina Schmähl, Christoph Schütz, Benedikt Morschheuser, Ali Sunyaev.

AB  - Background The digitalisation of healthcare has provided new ways to address disparities in sexual health outcomes that particularly affect ethnic and sexual minorities. Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots can provide personalised health education and refer users for appropriate medical consultations. We aimed to explore design principles of a chatbot-assisted culturally sensitive self-assessment intervention based on the disclosure of health-related information. Methods In 2022, an online survey was conducted among an ethnically diverse UK sample (N = 1,287) to identify the level and type of health-related information disclosure to sexual health chatbots, and reactions to chatbots’ risk appraisal. Follow-up interviews (N = 41) further explored perceptions of chatbot-led health assessment to identify aspects related to acceptability and utilisation. Datasets were analysed using one-way ANOVAs, linear regression, and thematic analysis. Results Participants had neutral-to-positive attitudes towards chatbots and were comfortable disclosing demographic and sensitive health information. Chatbot awareness, previous experience and positive attitudes towards chatbots predicted information disclosure. Qualitatively, four main themes were identified: “Chatbot as an artificial health advisor”, “Disclosing information to a chatbot”, “Ways to facilitate trust and disclosure”, and “Acting on self-assessment”. Conclusion Chatbots were acceptable for health self-assessment among this sample of ethnically diverse individuals. Most users reported being comfortable disclosing sensitive and personal information, but user anonymity is key to engagement with chatbots. As this technology becomes more advanced and widely available, chatbots could potentially become supplementary tools for health education and screening eligibility assessment. Future research is needed to establish their impact on screening uptake and access to health services among minoritised communities. © 2025 Nadarzynski et al.

AB  - Personalized nutrition (PN) represents an approach aimed at delivering tailored dietary recommendations, products, or services to support both prevention and treatment of nutrition-related conditions and to improve individual health using genetic, phenotypic, medical, nutritional, and other pertinent information. However, current approaches have yielded limited scientific success in improving diets or in mitigating diet-related conditions. In addition, PN currently caters to a specific subgroup of the population rather than having a widespread impact on diet and health at a population level. Addressing these challenges requires integrating traditional biomedical and dietary assessment methods with psycho-behavioral, and novel digital and diagnostic methods for comprehensive data collection, which holds considerable promise in alleviating present PN shortcomings. This comprehensive approach not only allows for deriving personalized goals (“what should be achieved”) but also customizing behavioral change processes (“how to bring about change”). We herein outline and discuss the concept of “Adaptive Personalized Nutrition Advice Systems,” which blends data from 3 assessment domains: 1) biomedical/health phenotyping; 2) stable and dynamic behavioral signatures; and 3) food environment data. Personalized goals and behavior change processes are envisaged to no longer be based solely on static data but will adapt dynamically in-time and in-situ based on individual-specific data. To successfully integrate biomedical, behavioral, and environmental data for personalized dietary guidance, advanced digital tools (e.g., sensors) and artificial intelligence-based methods will be essential. In conclusion, the integration of both established and novel static and dynamic assessment paradigms holds great potential for transitioning PN from its current focus on elite nutrition to a widely accessible tool that delivers meaningful health benefits to the general population. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: Digital serious games (DSGs), designed for purposes beyond entertainment and consumed via electronic devices, have garnered attention for their potential to enhance learning and promote behavior change. Their effectiveness depends on the quality of their design. Frameworks for DSG design can guide the creation of engaging games tailored to objectives such as education, health, and social impact. Objective: This study aims to review, analyze, and synthesize the literature on digital entertainment game design frameworks and DSG design frameworks (DSGDFWs). The focus is on conceptual frameworks offering high-level guidance for the game creation process rather than component-specific tools. We explore how these frameworks can be applied to create impactful serious games in fields such as health care and education. Key goals include identifying design principles, commonalities, dependencies, gaps, and opportunities in the literature. Suggestions for future research include empathic design thinking, artificial intelligence integration, and iterative improvements. The findings culminate in a synthesized 4-phase design process, offering generic guidelines for designers and developers to create effective serious games that benefit society. Methods: A 2-phase methodology was used: a scoping literature review and cluster analysis. A targeted search across 7 databases (ACM, Scopus, Springer, IEEE, Elsevier, JMIR Publications, and SAGE) was conducted using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Studies included academic or industry papers evaluating digital game design frameworks. Cluster analysis was applied to categorize the data, revealing trends and correlations among frameworks. Results: Of 987 papers initially identified, 25 (2.5%) met the inclusion criteria, with an additional 22 identified through snowballing, resulting in 47 papers. These papers presented 47 frameworks, including 16 (34%) digital entertainment game design frameworks and 31 (66%) DSGDFWs. Thematic analysis grouped frameworks into categories, identifying patterns and relationships between design elements. Commonalities, dependencies, and gaps were analyzed, highlighting opportunities for empathic design thinking and artificial intelligence applications. Key considerations in DSG design were identified and presented in a 4-phase design baseline with the outcome of a list of design guidelines that might, according to the literature, be applied to an end-to-end process of designing and building future innovative solutions. Conclusions: The main benefits of using DSGDFWs seem to be related to enhancing the effectiveness of serious games in achieving their intended objectives, such as learning, behavior change, and social impact. Limitations primarily seem to be related to constraints associated with the specific contexts in which the serious games are developed and used. Approaches in the future should be aimed at refining and adapting existing frameworks to different contexts and purposes, as well as exploring new frameworks that incorporate emerging technologies and design principles. ©Raluca Ionela Maxim, Joan Arnedo-Moreno.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of the study is to use a community-based participatory research strategy to refine and test the usability of an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered smartphone app, Sugar Smart, to be used by children’s parents/caregivers for the maintenance of dietary records and oral hygiene habits of children in Maharashtra, India, through a single-arm parallel randomized control trial. Materials and methods: The app, developed based on validated research on local dietary habits, was utilized by 100 children. To evaluate the app, two validated questionnaires and a 7-day diet diary format were employed. The first questionnaire assessed ease of use and compliance using a Chi-squared test, while the second examined improvements in dietary awareness before and after app usage through a paired t-test. Results: The findings indicate that a significant majority of users positively perceived the mobile app. The first questionnaire showed high ease of use and positive feedback (87% found it easy to use, 99% reported it helped regulate sugar intake). The Chi-squared test confirmed the statistical significance (p < 0.05). The second questionnaire revealed significant improvements in oral health awareness and diet (correct brushing: 64–98%, reduced sugar usage: 28–91%). The paired t-test confirmed these improvements (p < 0.05), validating the app’s effectiveness in enhancing dietary habits and oral health awareness. Conclusion: The study provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the digital app in improving parental awareness and management of children’s sugar intake. The significant improvements observed underscore the app’s potential as a valuable tool in pediatric dentistry and public health. Clinical significance: This app demonstrates the potential to revolutionize dietary monitoring and behavior change in pediatric populations, promoting healthier dietary behaviors and thus being an effective digital tool in the reduction of caries burden. © The Author(s).

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to generate natural language explanations in recommender systems, offering the potential for adaptive, personalized, and interactive communication. However, their ability to produce plausible yet inaccurate justifications poses a risk of misleading users at scale. This paper examines the risk of misleading LLM-generated explanations, focusing on the interplay between truthfulness and persuasiveness. We propose a clear terminology for categorizing misleading explanations, differentiating between factual errors and unfaithful representations of the system's workings. Drawing on research from machine learning, human-computer interaction, and persuasive communication, we identify key challenges in evaluating and mitigating misleading explanations. We outline directions for future research, including the development of robust evaluation metrics and methods for enhancing the factuality and faithfulness of LLM-generated explanations in recommender systems. © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Continuous support for improving lifestyle habits is effective in preventing metabolic syndrome. However, providing sustained support by healthcare professionals imposes a significant burden on them. With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) capable of efficiently generating messages, incorporating the characteristics of dietary guidance by healthcare professionals into LLM prompts may enable the generation of messages with the same motivational effect as professional guidance. To identify these key characteristics, we conducted a dietary-improvement experiment involving the LOCABO Challenge dietary-guidance program and collected data on dietary advice. Through qualitative analysis, we elucidated the process by which healthcare professionals review participants’ dietary records, formulate advice, and use motivational strategies in dietary guidance. We also explored potential approaches for incorporating our findings into the LLM design. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI‐based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI‐based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new‐age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - With the proliferation of mis- and disinformation in media, hallucinating large-language model output integrated into our software and devices, and the sheer volume of information and opinion available online, it is essential that we leverage critical thinking strategies to counter the various narratives and targeted messages ubiquitous in modern Western society. The present paper argues that many critical thinking strategies are based on behavioral theories with limited justification at the cognitive and neural level. These theories exhibit false dichotomies which are convenient and persuasive in their simplicity, but may in fact lead to vulnerabilities when used as a basis for critical thinking. We argue that critical thinking strategies need to be understood in cognitive terms, and extant behavioral theories re-examined and re-interpreted to understand how memory formation, elaboration, and recall impacts decision-making. To accomplish this, we will proceed as follows: 1) we will provide an overview of decision-making research and address some concerns with popular dual-process accounts; 2) we will provide a cognitively-grounded explanation of decision-making and how integrating information about source credibility may be counterproductive, 3) we will provide evidence from cognitive models how certain kinds of critical thinking strategies may be exploitable, an 4) we will make recommendations for critical thinking education including the necessary role of adaptive instructional systems to independently assess various critical thinking processes involved in sense-making. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - In e-commerce, Augmented Reality (AR) employs computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to enhance the shopping experience through personalized recommendations based on users’ physical data. However, concerns regarding privacy and perceived intrusiveness can undermine the persuasive appeal of personalized AR for e-commerce experiences. Can overtly communicating information transparency mitigate such concerns? Two between-subjects online experiments were conducted, revealing that consumers were drawn to the AR-powered e-commerce site due to its heightened perceived immersion and usefulness but also considered it more intrusive than the non-AR site. However, when both websites were AR-powered, the one with high information transparency significantly enhanced perceived privacy protection, reducing perceived intrusiveness. Perceived transparency positively mediated the effects, particularly among individuals with lower pre-existing trust in algorithms. These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of AR in strategic communications and the design of information transparency for AR-powered e-commerce. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Gamified mHealth applications are increasingly used to promote healthy behavior change, yet low participant engagement remains a challenge. Personalized content has shown promise in increasing engagement, however, creating personalized content is a time-consuming task. Generative Artificial Intelligence models, particularly Large Language Models, offer a potential solution with their ability to quickly generate relevant content. In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of LLM-generated content on participant engagement in health interventions using gamified mHealth applications. A total of 73 students and staff members of a university participated in a health intervention and were assigned into groups receiving either LLM-generated goals or predetermined goals. Engagement and perceived intrinsic motivation were measured and compared between the two groups. The results show no significant difference in engagement or perceived intrinsic motivation between participants receiving LLM-generated goals and those receiving predetermined goals. LLM-generated goals did not significantly negatively impact participant engagement and could therefore possibly offer a time-efficient approach to scalable content generation for mHealth applications. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in election campaigns is significantly transforming the political and democratic landscape. AI has introduced new dynamics into electoral processes, impacting the way campaigns are conducted, which can pose a threat to the integrity of democratic systems. Technological innovations affect the way election campaigns are managed and executed. From traditional media such as radio, television and film, to digital platforms, technological evolution has enabled greater personalization and effectiveness in political communication. AI facilitates the analysis of large volumes of data, enabling highly segmented and personalized campaigns. At the same time, technological threats are a growing concern for democracy. Data manipulation, false profiling and cyber-attacks are some of the risks faced by electoral processes. These practices can affect the transparency and fairness of elections, compromising basic principles such as the freedom to vote. Digitalization amplifies both information and disinformation. Political propaganda has become more sophisticated, using AI techniques to create and disseminate disinformative content more effectively. This phenomenon contributes to the fragmentation and polarization of public opinion and can erode trust in the democratic process and institutions. AI is used to improve the persuasiveness and determent of political parties and candidates. It allows the creation of more sophisticated communication strategies and the optimization of electoral resources. However, it also poses ethical and practical challenges, such as manipulation of reality through deepfakes and extreme segmentation of the electorate. Responses to the challenges posed by AI in the electoral field have been diverse. Some technology platforms have adopted self-regulatory measures, such as tagging AI-generated content. However, self-regulation has proved to be insufficient, and a more robust legislative response is required to protect the integrity of electoral processes. In some countries, laws prohibiting the use of deepfakes in election campaigns have already been implemented. AI offers both opportunities and risks, and its impact on democracy depends on how its applications are managed and its negative effects mitigated. It is crucial to establish clear national and international regulatory framework covering the use of AI in electoral campaigns. This framework must ensure transparency, fairness and protection of electoral rights. Collaboration between governments, electoral institutions, technology companies and civil society is essential to preserve the integrity and legitimacy of democratic processes in the digital era. © 2025 Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED).

AB  - In argumentation, the claim is the foundational proposition that underpins the argument, serving as the central pillar upon which the argument is constructed. It guides the subsequent presentation of evidence, reasoning, and analysis, thereby facilitating the audience's understanding of the core issue. Therefore, ensuring that the claim is precise and unambiguous is crucial for constructing a coherent and persuasive argument. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency in text rewriting tasks such as style transfer and query rewriting, their application to claim optimization remains unexplored. Unlike other rewriting tasks, claim clarification requires the model to rewrite ambiguous or unclear segments of the claim, enhance the content by adding omitted key details, and eliminate redundant or verbose elements. Addressing this gap, this paper evaluates the performance of LLMs on the claim clarification task across various settings. While popular rewriting evaluation methods such as BLEU and ROUGE rely on exact word matching, this paper introduces a novel semantic evaluation approach based on a sliding window mechanism. Three distinct LLMs, including LLama2, Mistral, and Qwen2, are assessed for their ability to clarify arguments through zero-shot or few-shot prompting, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Additionally, we propose a reinforcement learning-based clarification approach that optimally balances content preservation with claim clarity, thereby augmenting the performance of LLMs on the claim clarification task. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Introduction: The increased focus on the ethical aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) follows the increased use in society of data-driven analyses of personal information collected in the use of digital applications for various purposes that the individual is often not aware of. The purpose of this study is to investigate how values and norms are transformed into design choices in a participatory design process of an AI-based digital coaching application for promoting health and to prevent cardiovascular diseases, where a variety of expertise and perspectives are represented. Method: A participatory design process was conducted engaging domain professionals and potential users in co-design workshops, interviews and observations of prototype use. The design process and outcome was analyzed from a responsible design of AI systems perspective. Results: The results include deepened understanding of the values and norms underlying health coaching applications and how an AI-based intervention could provide person-tailored support in managing conflicting norms. Further, the study contributes to increased awareness of the value of participatory design in achieving value-based design of AI systems aimed at promoting health through behavior change, and the inclusion of social norms as a design material in the process. Conclusion: It was concluded that the relationship between the anticipated future users and the organization(s) or enterprises developing and implementing the health-promoting application is directing which values are manifested in the application. 2025 Lindgren, Lindvall and Richter-Sundberg.

AB  - This study explores the challenge of maintaining motivation in further education for working students, who face the double burden of work and learning. To address this issue, we investigate the design and implementation of a pedagogical conversational agent (PCA) within a web-based training (WBT) platform. Drawing on literature, interviews with 11 experts, and a creative workshop with 14 working students, we use the Hexad user type framework to tailor the WBT to each user’s motivational archetype. We prioritize design features for each of the six archetypes and instantiate these in a prototype. In a field experiment with 17 working students using the WBT prototype for exam preparation, we observe a significant increase in intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. This study contributes to the emerging field of PCA-enhanced digital learning, highlighting the potential of personalized motivation in persuasive dialogue systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Human footsteps play a significant role in everyday life, allowing individuals to discern the emotions, gender, and intentions of others solely from the sound of their footsteps. However, the influence of footstep sounds made when walking on different floor types in virtual reality (VR) environments when joining conversational groups remains unclear. In this paper, we present a controlled study (N=50) to assess the impact of five different floor types, associated with specific footstep sounds and visuals, on the persuasiveness of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) when inviting participants to join a free-standing conversational group. We analyze routes taken by participants and the positions at which they join the group, which may be compliant or not with the agent’s request when approaching the group while walking on different virtual floor types. Our findings reveal that the type of floor being walked upon, defined by footstep sounds and visual appearance, significantly impacts the persuasiveness of ECAs and the trajectories taken by participants to join the group. Participants took longer paths and joined the group in the presence of more pleasant footstep sounds. Further, they tended to adhere to social norms by avoiding walking through the group’s center. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This chapter explores the intriguing and complex relationship between the human microbiome and Bipolar Disorder (BD). The microbiome, notably the gut microbiota, has been increasingly recognised as a key performer in brain health and disease. This is due to its role in the gut-brain axis, a bidirectional communication between the gastrointestinal tract and the central nervous system. Disruptions in the gut microbiota due to factors such as diet, and stress, may influence this axis and potentially trigger or exacerbate psychiatric conditions. Hence, we investigate into the present interpretation of the microbiome's role in mental health, concentrating on its impact on mood regulation and cognitive function. Consequently, we also explore the possible mechanisms through which microbiome disruption may pay to the behavioural changes observed in BD. Further exploration understand the complex interplay between the microbiome and BD and translate these findings into effective therapeutic plans. © 2025

AB  - Objective: Health recommender systems (HRSs) are increasingly used to complement existing clinical decision-making processes, but their use for chronic diseases remains underexplored. Recognizing the importance of collaborative decision making (CDM) and patient engagement in chronic disease treatment, this review explored how HRSs support patients in managing their illness. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the framework proposed by Arksey and O’Malley, advanced by Levac et al., in line with the PRISMA-ScR checklist. Quantitative (descriptive numerical summary) and qualitative (inductive content analysis) methods wered used to synthesize the data. Results: Forty-five articles were included in the final review, most commonly covering diabetes (9/45, 20%), mental health (9/45, 20.0%), and tobacco dependence (7/45, 15.6%). Behavior change theories (10/45, 22.2%) and authoritative sources (10/45, 22.2%) were the most commonly referenced sources for design and development work. From the thematic analysis, we conclude: (a) the main goal of HRSs is to induce behavior change, but limited research investigates their effectiveness in achieving this aim; (b) studies acknowledge that theories, models, frameworks, and/or guidelines help design HRSs to elicit specific behavior change, but they do not implement them; (c) connections between CDM and HRS purpose should be more explicit; and (d) HRSs can often offer other self-management services, such as progress tracking and chatbots. Conclusions: We recommend a greater emphasis on evaluation outcomes beyond algorithmic performance to determine HRS effectiveness and the creation of an evidence-driven, methodological approach to creating HRSs to optimize their use in enhancing patient care. Lay summary: Our work aims to provide a summary of the current landscape of health recommender system (HRS) use for chronic disease management. HRSs are digital tools designed to help people manage their health by providing personalized recommendations based on their health history, behaviors, and preferences, enabling them to make more informed health decisions. Given the increased use of these tools for personalized care, and especially with advancements in generative artificial intelligence, understanding the current methods and evaluation processes used is integral to optimizing their effectiveness. Our findings show that HRSs are most used for diabetes, mental health, and tobacco dependence, but only a small percentage of publications directly reference and/or use relevant frameworks to help guide their design and evaluation processes. Furthermore, the goal for most of these HRSs is to induce behavior change, but there is limited research investigating how effective they are in accomplishing this. Given these findings, we recommend that evaluations shift their focus from algorithms to more holistic approaches and to be more intentional about the processes used when designing the tool to support an evidence-driven approach and ultimately create more effective and useful HRSs for chronic disease management. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Using co-design principles based on the Health CASCADE framework, we aimed to describe the collaborative process undertaken to develop a 24-hour time-use intervention, called Small Steps, which promoted gradual and incremental health-behavior change. A secondary aim was to reflect on the challenges and benefits of co-design in this project, offering insights into the “why” and “how” to co-design 24-hour time-use interventions with priority populations. Twelve participants were invited and participated in 6 co-design workshops (June 2023–January 2024). To prioritize older adults’ views in the end-product, 8 adults aged >65 years (the target population) and 4 allied health professionals with >2 years’ experience working with the target population were recruited. Workshops and activities were structured using the British Design Council's Double Diamond Design Process to stimulate design thinking. Where possible, participant-led documentation was used to reduce the bias associated with academic scribing and empower participants to provide input and facilitate ownership for the project. Workshop activities and discussions were captured through printouts, audio and iPad screen recordings and analyzed through reflexive thematic and content analysis. Co-designers contributed to all elements of the intervention including the website design, the content, and the level of researcher input during the intervention. Iterative improvements were made based on the unique perspectives and needs of the community experts. During the action planning process, older adults wanted both support and autonomy, while maintaining the freedom to adapt these options to their individual needs. Older adults also preferred a step-by-step approach, allowing for gradual behavior changes across the intervention to avoid feelings of becoming overwhelmed. The co-design process enabled the tailoring of the Small Steps intervention to the specific needs of its intended audience. Key factors contributing to the co-design included flexibility in the design process, fostering a supportive environment, and empowering participants through activities that guided and stimulated their thinking. These elements not only helped shape the development of Small Steps but reinforced the value of co-design in developing personalised interventions for older adults. 2025 Blake, Davis, Mellow, Hull, Robins, Laver, Dumuid, Olds, Keage, Di Venuto and Smith.

AB  - Although the benefits of machine learning are undeniable in healthcare, explainability plays a vital role in improving transparency and understanding the most decisive and persuasive variables for prediction. The challenge is to identify explanations that make sense to the biomedical expert. This work proposes discernibility as a new approach to faithfully reflect human cognition, based on the user's perception of a relationship between explanations and data for a given variable. A total of 50 participants (19 biomedical experts and 31 data scientists) evaluated their perception of the discernibility of explanations from both synthetic and human-based datasets (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey). The low inter-rater reliability of discernibility (Intraclass Correlation Coefficient < 0.5), with no significant difference between areas of expertise or levels of education, highlights the need for an objective metric of discernibility. Thirteen statistical coefficients were evaluated for their ability to capture, for a given variable, the relationship between its values and its explanations using Passing-Bablok regression. Among these, dcor was shown to be a reliable metric for assessing the discernibility of explanations, effectively capturing the clarity of the relationship between the data and their explanations, and providing clues to underlying pathophysiological mechanisms not immediately apparent when examining individual predictors. Discernibility can also serve as an evaluation metric for model quality, helping to prevent overfitting and aiding in feature selection, ultimately providing medical practitioners with more accurate and persuasive results. © 2025 The Authors

AB  - Background: Substance misuse is prevalent in criminal justice populations. Addressing it in the criminal justice system (CJS) is vital for improving public health and reducing crime. Aim: This study explores the mechanisms, barriers, and facilitators of a brief psychosocial intervention for reducing substance misuse among inmates in a North Indian prison. Methods: A multidisciplinary team evaluated qualitatively using the Framework Method, guided by the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) framework. Participants were purposively selected from those enrolled in a clinical trial and included inmates aged 18–60 who completed three sessions of the intervention. Data were collected through in-depth interviews (IDIs) and focus group discussions (FGDs) between November and December 2023. Thematic analysis identified key themes related to behavior change, implementation barriers, and facilitators. Results: The study identified ten main themes encompassing facilitators and barriers to behavior change. Key facilitators included peer influence, supportive relationships, intervention strategies, and self‑reflection. Major barriers were access to drugs, prison dynamics, psychological stressors, stigmatization, and withdrawal symptoms. The BCW framework highlighted the importance of addressing both individual and contextual factors, such as capability, opportunity, and motivation, to support behavior change. The intervention’s emphasis on stress management, acceptance, and building supportive peer networks was critical for its success. Conclusion: Individual interventions must be supplemented by systemic and structural changes to address prison‑specific challenges. Comprehensive staff training, integrated treatment models, peer support systems, and policy advocacy are recommended to enhance the effectiveness and scalability of psychosocial interventions in the CJS. © 2025 Indian Journal of Psychiatry | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Concerns have been raised over AI-generated deepfakes and their impact on democracy. Unlike earlier forms of disinformation relying on text or traditional video-editing techniques (cheapfakes), deepfakes employ artificial intelligence, provoking speculations that they may be even more persuasive and harder to debunk. Using an experiment with a multiple-message design (N = 2,085), we found that fake videos suggesting a sex, corruption, or prejudice scandal—but not text-only fakes—elicited substantial reputational damage for an innocent politician, regardless of whether the underlying technique was “cheap” or “deep.” This was visible in altered attitudes, emotions, and voting intentions. However, exposure to a journalistic fact-check substantially reduced and even eliminated the detrimental effects. These findings have important implications for our theoretical understanding related to the effects of and mitigation strategies for deepfakes. While clearly highlighting the significant persuasive potential of deepfakes (and visual disinformation in general), the present study paints a more nuanced picture than was previously possible. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Artificial-intelligence (AI) -powered chatbots have been increasingly utilized in interventions to promote physical activity and healthy lifestyle behaviors. This systematic review explored the effectiveness of these chatbots in physical activity interventions. Methods: A systematic review was conducted using comprehensive searches across PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, and the Cochrane Library. Studies included were peer-reviewed intervention studies utilizing AI-powered chatbots designed to promote physical activity, conducted from 2010 onward and published in English. Results: Of 11,347 articles identified, eight studies published between 2018 and 2023 met the inclusion criteria. Using randomized controlled trials or pre–post designs, these studies involved sample sizes from 15 to 116 participants. Interventions included chatbots, voice-activated assistants, and health-coaching applications in remote and controlled settings. Primary outcomes focused on physical activity metrics like moderate and vigorous physical activity and step counts, with secondary outcomes covering quality of life and engagement. Intervention effectiveness varied, with some showing significant improvements in physical activity while others had mixed results. Study quality assessment revealed generalizability, data collection, and missing data-handling limitations. Conclusion: AI-powered chatbots show promise as practical tools for promoting physical activity. They offer personalized, engaging, and scalable interventions that can be integrated into broader public health strategies. Despite their promise, the variability in effectiveness and inconsistencies in study quality underscore an urgent need for future research to standardize intervention designs and advance AI techniques for more reliable and scalable health outcomes. © 2025 National Academy of Kinesiology.

AB  - Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong zero-shot generalization across various tasks, especially when integrated with large language models (LLMs). However, their ability to comprehend rhetorical and persuasive visual media, such as advertisements, remains understudied. Ads often employ atypical imagery, using surprising object juxtapositions to convey shared properties. For example, Fig. 1(e) shows a beer with a feather-like texture. This requires advanced reasoning to deduce that this atypical representation signifies the beer's lightness. We introduce three novel tasks, Multi-label Atypicality Classification, Atypicality Statement Retrieval, and Atypical Object Recognition, to benchmark VLMs' understanding of atypicality in persuasive images. We evaluate how well VLMs use atypicality to infer an ad's message and test their reasoning abilities by employing semantically challenging negatives. Finally, we pioneer atypicality-aware verbalization by extracting comprehensive image descriptions sensitive to atypical elements. Findings reveal that: (1) VLMs lack advanced reasoning capabilities compared to LLMs; (2) simple, effective strategies can extract atypicality-aware information, leading to comprehensive image verbalization; (3) atypicality aids persuasive ad understanding.

AB  - This research applies the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to investigate how self-referencing in Large Language Model (LLM)-based health coaching influences user trust and perceptions of anthropomorphism. We synthesized theory-driven design principles to guide the integration of self-referencing and demonstrated them in a vignette-based prototype. Through a single-factorial between-subjects experiment, analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and qualitative feedback, we identified a dual effect of self-referencing: while professional self-referencing enhances trust via increased anthropomorphism, overly personal references can directly undermine trust. Based on these findings, we refined our design principles to optimize trust-building in LLM-based coaching. Our contributions provide actionable design guidelines for creating more effective and trustworthy AI-driven health interventions, advancing the understanding of anthropomorphic design in digital coaching contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of users’ “belief in a just world” (BJW) on the persuasiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) agents’ recommendations. Our prediction that users’ preferences for human or AI agents vary according to their BJW levels was tested experimentally. The results revealed that individuals with high BJW rated human agents’ recommendations more favorably than those of AI agents, whereas those with low BJW preferred AI agents’ ones. This interaction was mediated by the perceptions of the agents’ benevolence and selfishness, which varied depending on the BJW levels and agent type. High-BJW individuals perceived human agents as more benevolent and less selfish, whereas low-BJW individuals showed the opposite pattern. In contrast, AI agents’ benevolence and selfishness perceptions were not influenced by BJW levels. This study provides theoretical insights by identifying BJW as a key factor affecting AI agents’ persuasive effects and suggests that perceived benevolence and selfishness are the psychological mechanisms behind these effects. These findings also offer practical guidance for designing more effective AI agent strategies tailored to consumer BJW levels. Copyright 2025, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Purpose: The research aims to investigate the factors influencing the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in pharmaceutical industry companies, specifically focusing on its impact on salesforce performance. Design/methodology/approach: We collected research data from pharmaceutical industry companies, specifically the salesforce teams, using a valid and reliable questionnaire. Descriptive data analysis was used to summarize the participants’ demographic characteristics, and inferential data analysis employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to assess the reliability and validity of the measurement model and the relationships between variables. Findings: About 176 questionnaires were completed, and only 169 were deemed complete and used for data analysis. This study reveals a significant relationship between pharmaceutical salesforce performance and AI adoption (a path coefficient of 0.647, a p-value of 0.000 and an R2 of 0.584). Supervisory support and career development emerged as the essential variables of pharmaceutical salesforce performance, with the strongest relationship to AI adoption, as indicated by a path coefficient of 0.434 and a p-value of 0.000. Practical implications: Based on the results of this study, supervisory support drives AI adoption, underscoring the importance of leaders during technological transformations. Supervisors help minimize employees’ opposition to change by providing concise direction, training and persuasion. By providing clear guidance, training and persuasion, supervisors decrease employee resistance to change. This supports community socioeconomic growth by enhancing patient care and access to healthcare, especially in underserved areas. Originality/value: This paper is the first to link salesforce performance and AI adoption in pharmaceutical companies. © 2025, Wael Abdallah, Mulham Aziza and Hassan Baz Chamas.

AB  - Research suggests that social relationships and situational motivation drive change in behavior. Digital interaction technologies increasingly integrate customizable avatars and conversational chatbots to enhance long-term adoption. This development has prompted a critical examination of how affective attachment to digital systems influences technology acceptance. Traditional models (e.g., UTAUT2) focus on perceived usefulness and ease of use. In this paper, we extend the UTAUT2 framework by incorporating techno-social bonding and situational motivation as pivotal constructs to shape system adoption. Our model posits that personalization options, such as avatar customization and conversational agent interaction, foster techno-social bonding, a form of digital attachment that enhances perceived social presence and user satisfaction. In addition, we explore how situational motivation, particularly intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors, moderates the relationship between personalization characteristics and system acceptance. The application case of this paper is a Continuous Improvement (CI) system for production environments. We propose a four-week microrandomized trial. Participants will interact with the CI system under varying conditions, including chatbot-based versus form-based interactions and fixed versus personalized avatars. Key outcomes, including techno-social bonding and situational motivation, will be assessed with conventional technology acceptance constructs. This paper improves existing technology acceptance models by including techno-social bonding. This provides a deeper understanding of longterm system adoption and practical guidance for designing CI systems. Furthermore, the proposed model contributes to the development of Behavior Change Support Systems (BCSS) by integrating motivational and affective mechanisms that promote sustainable behavior change.  © 2025 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Automated detection of persuasion techniques is crucial for combating disinformation, but is hindered by the lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets, especially for less common techniques. This paper introduces SynthClassify, a novel framework and several large-scale synthetic datasets for advancing research in this area. SynthClassify uses a cyclic process: a GPT-4 based generator creates text designed to promote or minimize specific institutions using one of 23 persuasion techniques, and an ensemble of GPT-4 classifiers assesses the text's alignment with the intended technique. This iterative process, guided by a confidence threshold, achieves high-quality synthetic data without expensive manual annotation. The resulting dataset contains 634K instances across 19 countries and nearly 10K institutions. The dataset has been translated into six additional languages (Arabic, Chinese, French, Hindi, Russian, and Spanish), enabling cross-lingual research. We benchmark SynthClassify against multiple LLMs, including open-source models. We also explore the impact of prompt engineering, ensemble size, and confidence thresholds on classifier performance. © 2025 SPIE. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies on leadership-based organizational communication and employee performance within contemporary workplaces. While prior research has acknowledged AI’s potential in optimizing communication processes, significant gaps remain in understanding its specific influence on core communication dimensions and organizational outcomes. This study addresses these gaps by examining six key communication elements—informing, message reception, feedback, acceptance, persuasion, and reaction—to assess whether AI technologies significantly enhance employee performance by improving internal communication efficiency and reducing transmission errors, which are crucial for productive interactions. Using a quantitative approach, data were collected via a self-administered questionnaire from 203 employees of a major Romanian food industry company operating globally, including leaders and employees from three Eastern European countries. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the relationships between communication dimensions and performance. The findings revealed that informing, receiving, and accepting messages, along with reaction-provoking, had strong positive effects on performance, while feedback and persuasion showed moderate impacts. These results emphasize the transformative role of AI in communication processes, optimizing message flow and positively influencing employee behavior, thereby enhancing productivity and organizational efficiency. This research contributes to the growing body of literature by situating AI-driven communication within the broader organizational context, offering actionable insights for managers aiming to integrate AI ethically and effectively. Additionally, it offers a set of recommendations for employees and managers to lead communication process according to the new actual era of digitization, which is offering real benefits for both parts. It also provides a robust foundation for future research, encouraging longitudinal and cross-cultural studies to further investigate AI’s implications for organizational diversity, innovation, and employee well-being. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Chatbots are increasingly accepted in public health for their ability to replicate human-like communication and provide scalable, 24/7 services. The high prevalence of dental caries in children underscores the need for early and effective intervention. Objective: This study aimed to develop the 30-Day FunDee chatbot and evaluate its effectiveness, usability, and acceptability in delivering oral health education to caregivers of children aged 6 to 36 months. Methods: The chatbot was created using the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot behavior change model, integrating behavioral change theories into content designed for 3‐5 minutes of daily use over 30 days. A pre-post experimental study was conducted from December 2021 to February 2022 in Hat Yai District, Songkhla Province, and Maelan District, Pattani Province, Thailand. Fifty-eight caregivers completed a web-based structured questionnaire at baseline and 2 months post baseline to evaluate knowledge, protection motivation theory-based perceptions, and tooth-brushing practices. Usability was assessed via chatbot logfiles and a web-based questionnaire at 2 months post baseline. Acceptability was evaluated through three methods: (1) open-ended chatbot interactions on day 30, (2) a web-based structured questionnaire at 2 months post baseline, and (3) semistructured telephone interviews with 15 participants 2 weeks post intervention. Participants for interviews were stratified by adherence levels and randomly selected from Hatyai and Maelan districts. All self-reported variables were measured on a 5-point Likert scale (1=lowest, 5=highest). Results: The chatbot was successfully developed based on the 4 components of the AI chatbot behavior change model. Participants had a mean age of 34.5 (SD 8.6) years. The frequency of tooth brushing among caregivers significantly improved, increasing from 72.4% at baseline to 93.1% two months post baseline (P=.006). Protection motivation theory-based perceptions also showed significant improvement, with mean scores rising from 4.0 (SD 0.6) at baseline to 4.5 (SD 0.6) two months post baseline (P<.001). The chatbot received high ratings for satisfaction (4.7/5, SD 0.6) and usability (4.7/5, SD 0.5). Participants engaged with the chatbot for an average of 24.7 (SD 7.2) days out of 30. Caregivers praised the chatbot’s content quality, empathetic communication, and multimedia design, but noted the intervention’s lengthy duration and messaging system as limitations. Conclusions: The 30-Day FunDee chatbot effectively enhanced caregivers’ perceptions of oral health care and improved tooth-brushing practices for children aged 6‐36 months. High user satisfaction and engagement demonstrate its potential as an innovative tool for oral health education. These findings warrant further validation through large-scale, randomized controlled trials. © Kittiwara Pupong, Jaranya Hunsrisakhun, Samerchit Pithpornchaiyakul, Supawadee Naorungroj.

AB  - Introduction: The glucose management indicator (GMI) and time-in-range (TIR) are important glycemic parameters calculated from continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) values. KARAZ, a hybrid Internet of things—artificial intelligence platform, was developed in Saudi Arabia to help manage diabetes mellitus. The complex nature of self-care and behavior changes associated with diabetes mellitus requires breaking large behaviors into achievable ones and related incentives. Aim: This study explored how tiny habits as a behavioral intervention and incentive system affect glycemic control among KARAZ Platform users with diabetes mellitus in various age groups in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This retrospective study included KARAZ Platform users and analyzed the effects of behavioral interventions and incentives on GMI and TIR as glycemic control parameters. Results: Of 296 active users, 118 (40%) and 148 (50%) maintained a desirable TIR and GMI, respectively. Adult females aged ≥ 26 years who consistently followed tiny habits and behavior changes exhibited a significant reduction in the GMI (5%). Intrinsic motivation through behavioral modification was more effective than external incentives for maintaining glucose control. Conclusion: The findings highlight how behavioral interventions can impact GMI, suggesting their effectiveness in promoting better health behaviors and improving glycemic control in the Saudi Arabian context. Further research should investigate how these habits and behaviors can be maintained sustainably without relying on external incentives. Recommendations discussed how children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus would benefit from CGM connection to KARAZ Platform iteration and the integration of a comprehensive diabetes care program within the Saudi health system. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Regular exercise recommendations (ERs) and physical activity (PA) are crucial for the prevention and management of chronic diseases. However, creating effective exercise programs demand substantial time and specialized expertise from both medical and sports professionals. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising solution by helping create personalized ERs. While LLMs show potential, their use in exercise planning remains in its early stages and requires further exploration. Objectives: This study aims to systematically review and classify the applications of LLMs in ERs and PA. It also seeks to identify existing gaps and provide insights into future research directions for optimizing LLM integration in personalized health interventions. Methods: A scoping review methodology was used to identify studies related to LLM applications in ERs and PA. Literature searches were conducted in Web of Science, PubMed, IEEE, and arXiv for English language papers published up to March 21, 2024. Keywords included LLMs, chatbots, ERs, PA, fitness plan, and related terms. Two independent reviewers (XL and CH) screened and selected studies based on predefined inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize findings, which were presented narratively. Results: An initial search identified 598 papers, of which 1.8% (11/598) of studies were included after screening and applying selection criteria. Of these, ChatGPT-based models were used in 55% (6/11) of the studies. In addition, 73% (8/11) of the studies used expert evaluations and user feedback to assess model usability, and 45% (5/11) of the studies used experimental designs to evaluate LLM interventions in ERs and PA. Key findings indicated that LLMs can generate tailored ERs, save time in clinical practice, and enhance safety by incorporating patient-specific data. They also increased engagement and supported behavior change. This made PA guidance more accessible, especially in remote or underserved communities. Conclusions: This review highlights the promising applications of LLMs in ERs and PA but emphasizes that they remain a supplement to human expertise. Expert validation is essential to ensure safety and mitigate risks. Future research should prioritize pilot testing, clinician training programs, and large-scale clinical trials to enhance feasibility, transparency, and ethical integration. © Xiangxun Lai, Jiacheng Chen, Yue Lai, Shengqi Huang, Yongdong Cai, Zhifeng Sun, Xueding Wang, Kaijiang Pan, Qi Gao, Caihua Huang.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in enhancing various aspects of healthcare, including health provider–patient communication. However, some have raised the concern that such communication may adopt implicit communication norms that deviate from what patients want or need from talking with their healthcare provider. This paper explores the possibility of using LLMs to enable patients to choose their preferred communication style when discussing their medical cases. By providing a proof-of-concept demonstration using ChatGPT-4, we suggest LLMs can emulate different healthcare provider–patient communication approaches (building on Emanuel and Emanuel’s four models: paternalistic, informative, interpretive and deliberative). This allows patients to engage in a communication style that aligns with their individual needs and preferences. We also highlight potential risks associated with using LLMs in healthcare communication, such as reinforcing patients’ biases and the persuasive capabilities of LLMs that may lead to unintended manipulation. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2025.

AB  - The modernization of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) program is a priority. The Texas WIC chatbot, Maya, streamlines client interactions through dialog-based responses. This qualitative study explored client capabilities, motivations, and opportunities for seeking nutrition information about breastfeeding, formula feeding, infant feeding safety, adequacy of infant feeding, and complementary feeding via a chatbot. A team conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with Texas WIC clients (n = 19 women). All interviews were transcribed and subjected to a two-coder, four-phase process utilizing a theory-based codebook. Codes were compiled and thematically categorized. Identified themes included (1) motivations through necessity or resource availability, (2) client capabilities and Maya usability, and (3) opportunities for connection, support, and encouragement. Texas WIC clients that participated in this study expressed motivations, capabilities, and opportunities to engage with nutrition information through Maya. They described Maya as a favorable resource for behavior changes, and a trusted source of nutrition information, citing the credibility of WIC and reliability of the chatbot. The findings may inform future research and development of public health chatbots. Additional research is required to explore how different factors such as language and technology usage may impact client capabilities, motivations, and opportunities to seek nutrition information with regard to infant feeding. © 2025 by the authors.

AB  - This paper investigates the impact of large language model (LLM)-based coaching interventions on enhancing physical activity and nutritional habits, following motivational interviewing guidelines. By exploring user perceptions through qualitative research involving eight interviews, five key themes emerged: the tension between the need for authenticity and reservations about AI humanization, the desire for personalized coaching and autonomy, the necessity of simplifying daily tasks, the aspiration for self-development, and the need for perceived privacy and trust. The findings reveal that perceptions of LLM-based coaching are multifaceted and cannot be easily classified as purely beneficial or concerning; they vary based on the specific implementation. This complexity indicates that certain aspects can simultaneously present both benefits and risks. The paper discusses theoretical implications and offers practical recommendations to enhance the advantages and mitigate the risks associated with LLM-based coaching interventions. © 2025 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - The digital revolution has spurred significant growth in online reviews and user-generated content. Traditional methods used in Marketing for analysing large datasets have limitations, emphasising the need for improved analytical approaches, particularly with the advent of artificial intelligence technology. This research used a state-of-the-art transformer model to analyse extensive online book reviews to accurately identify six specific emotions in the reviews of both fiction (hedonic) and nonfiction (utilitarian) genres. This study collected 3,157,703 reviews of 15,293 books voted ‘best book of the year’ on GoodReads.com over the past decade. Our findings reveal noticeable differences in emotional intensity across genres, with nonfiction displaying a slightly higher level of joy, and fiction showing higher levels of anger, sadness and surprise. Joy emerged as the dominant emotion across genres; however, it does not necessarily have a direct impact on book ratings. This study emphasises the intricacies of reader emotions, serving as a significant case study for marketers and publishers aiming to optimise their strategies in the contemporary literary market. The study contributes to the literature on the impact of consumers’ emotional responses, how they are reflected in social review commentary for high-involvement online products, and their impact on product ratings. © 2024 Australian and New Zealand Marketing Academy.

AB  - Mental illness stigma in healthcare providers negatively impacts patient care and well-being, yet existing interventions to mitigate this stigma are often resource-intensive and difficult to scale. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a conversational agent (CA) named Stigma Educational Bot 1.0, powered by a large language model (LLM), specifically GPT-4. The CA aims to reduce stigma among healthcare providers by delivering an educational program grounded in anti-stigma principles and behavior change theories across four modules. The CA was developed using the GPT Editor interface, incorporating tailored instructions and a curated knowledge base from evidence-based resources, including materials from the Pan American Health Organization. Its performance was evaluated through four key tasks: direct question answering, generation of case scenarios, identification of stigma in simulated clinical interactions, and generation of empathetic testimonies. Expert evaluators assessed the CA's outputs using a 5-point Likert scale and performance metrics such as precision and recall. Results indicate that the CA excels in delivering structured educational content on topics like 'Conditions' (scores of 5.0) but shows limitations in foundational concepts like 'Definition' (scores as low as 2.5). It demonstrated high consistency in language and style when generating case scenarios and testimonies, with perceived empathy scores up to 4.5. However, the CA exhibited moderate performance in identifying stigmatizing behaviors, with F1 scores ranging from 0.48 to 0.54 and lower recall rates, particularly for overt manifestations of stigma. The study highlights the potential of GPT-based conversational agents as scalable tools for stigma reduction among healthcare providers by offering accessible and interactive educational interventions. Limitations include reliance on simulated tasks, specific training materials, and moderate performance in stigma detection. Future work should focus on enhancing foundational knowledge delivery, improving the identification of overt stigmatizing behaviors, and assessing real-world impact. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces an AI-based health assistant designed to foster healthier eating habits among young adults. Leveraging the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of behavior change, the system integrates personalized dietary interventions with advanced AI technologies, including a graph-based database and dynamic user interactions powered by ChatGPT. Key features include meal logging, nutrient visualization, and stage-specific recommendations tailored to each user’s progress. A structured evaluation framework lays the foundation for assessing the system’s effectiveness in promoting sustained behavioral improvements. While the current work focuses on short-term outcomes, future enhancements aim to incorporate wearable integrations, gamification, and expanded personalization to address a diverse user base. This research represents a significant step toward harnessing AI to address complex dietary challenges through ethical, user-centric health interventions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Objective: This study presents a pilot randomized controlled trial to assess the usability, feasibility, and initial efficacy of a mobile app-based relational artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot (Exerbot) intervention for increasing physical activity behavior. Methods: The study was conducted over a 1-week period, during which participants were randomized to either converse with a baseline chatbot without relational capacity (control group) or a relational chatbot using social relational communication strategies. Objectively measured physical activity data were collected using smartphone pedometers. Results: The study was feasible in enrolling a sample of 36 participants and with a 94% retention rate after 1 week. Daily engagement rate with the AI chatbot reached over 88% across the groups. Findings revealed that the control group experienced a significant decrease in steps on the final day, whereas the group interacting with the relational chatbot maintained their step counts throughout the study period. Importantly, individuals who engaged with the relational chatbot reported a stronger social bond with the chatbot compared to those in the control group. Conclusions: Leveraging AI chatbot and the relationship-building capabilities of AI holds promise in the development of cost-effective, accessible, and sustainable behavior change interventions. This approach may benefit individuals with limited access to conventional in-person behavior interventions.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a powerful tool, that has the potential to impact society on multiple levels. Increased adoption as well as employment of AI in new product development and business processes have led to heightened interest and optimism on one hand, whilst increasing fears of potential negative societal consequences on the other. The ethics of AI has subsequently become a topical issue for academics, industry players, health practitioners and regulators, who have a goal and responsibility to protect the public and limit widening inequality. Despite the publication of numerous AI ethical frameworks, guidelines and regulations, none have specifically focused on nutrition and behaviour change. Advances in technology, including AI and machine learning, have opened up novel ways to deliver personalization to guide individuals towards healthier behaviours or to manage their conditions. This perspective synthesizes the key topics that intersect in nutrition and behaviour change where AI is leveraged to provide personalized advice. We propose a 7-pillar framework to guide the development of ethical and transparent AI solutions to build consumer and practitioner trust. Copyright © 2025 Abrahams and Raimundo.

AB  - The impact of an avatar on real-world behaviors of users is known as the Proteus Effect. Different user avatar bond (UAB) aspects, including identifying, immersing, and compensating via the avatar, influence an individual’s Proteus Effect propensity. This study aimed to use machine learning (ML) classifiers to automate the prediction of those likely to experience Proteus Effect, based on their reports of identifying, immersing, and compensating with their avatar. Participants were 565 gamers (Mage = 29.3 years; SD = 10.6), assessed twice, six months apart, using the User-Avatar-Bond Scale and the Proteus Effect Scale. Tuned and untuned ML classifiers showed ML models could accurately identify individuals with higher Proteus Effect propensity, informed by a gamer’s reported UAB, age, and length of gaming involvement, both concurrently and longitudinally (i.e., six months later). Random forests performed better than other MLs, with avatar identification as the strongest predictor. This suggests higher Proteus Effect propensity for those with a stronger user-avatar bond, informing gamified health applications to introduce adaptive behavioral changes via the avatar. Prevention and practice implications are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  -                   Managerial responses, which represent firms’ public replies to online reviews, are commonly employed in customer communications. Using a dataset collected from a leading mobile game app platform in China, this research examines the effect of managerial responses on the review updates of customers who receive them, that is, the direct effect of managerial responses. Platform users can update their reviews, and complete records of review updates are observable, which allows us to utilize variations in the same customer’s review ratings of a single game both before and after receiving a managerial response. Addressing concerns regarding the endogeneity of managerial responses, improvements in game quality, and censored data in rating updates, we find that users who update their reviews after receiving managerial responses upgrade their ratings by an average of one star. In addition, we find that the positive direct effect of managerial responses is negatively moderated by the level of response politeness, measured separately using both machine learning and large language models. By conducting a survey study, we further show that as the level of politeness increases, the likelihood of reviewers perceiving a managerial response as an attempt to persuade them also increases. These findings highlight the positive direct effect of managerial response and the importance of response style, specifically politeness, which can produce a backfire effect in online communications. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Early work has found that large language models (LLMs) can generate persuasive content. However, evidence on whether they can also personalize arguments to individual attributes remains limited, despite being crucial for assessing misuse. This preregistered study examines AI-driven persuasion in a controlled setting, where participants engaged in short multiround debates. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 12 conditions in a 2 × 2 × 3 design: (1) human or GPT-4 debate opponent; (2) opponent with or without access to sociodemographic participant data; (3) debate topic of low, medium or high opinion strength. In debate pairs where AI and humans were not equally persuasive, GPT-4 with personalization was more persuasive 64.4% of the time (81.2% relative increase in odds of higher post-debate agreement; 95% confidence interval [+26.0%, +160.7%], P < 0.01; N = 900). Our findings highlight the power of LLM-based persuasion and have implications for the governance and design of online platforms. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - A novel video-based real-time system based on AI (artificial intelligence) was developed to detect clinical signs in fish exposed to pathogens. We selected a White Spot Disease model involving rainbow trout as the experimental animal and the parasitic ciliate Ichthyophthirius multifiliis as a pathogen. We compared two identical fish tank systems: one tank was infected by co-habitation, whereas the other tank was kept non-infected (sham infection). The two fish tanks were separately video monitored (full top and side view) during the course of infection, during which fish were removed whenever they developed clinical signs (direct visual inspection by the observer). Image analysis (object detection, classification and tracking) was used to track behavioural changes in fish (in every recorded video frame), focusing on movement patterns and spatial localisation. Initially, the two fish groups (infected and non-infected) exhibited similar behaviour and non-infected fish did not change behaviour during the 15 d observation period (from 5 d before infection until 10 dpi). At 4, 7, 8, 9 and 10 dpi some infected fish showed clinical signs (equilibrium disturbance, gasping and lethargy) and were removed from the experiment. Anorexia occurred from 5 dpi and a gradual progression of gasping behaviour was noted, whereas the frequency of fish flashing (rubbing/scratching against objects) was low. Equilibrium disturbances and the development of white spots in the skin appeared to be a much later (8–10 dpi at this temperature) indicator of infection. The video analysis showed a general distribution of non-infected fish in all parts of the fish tank during the entire experiment, whereas infected fish already at 4–5 dpi moved towards higher water currents in the top and bottom positions. This change of fish positioning within the tank appeared as a promising early indicator of infection. The study suggests that continuous monitoring of fish behaviour using AI can potentially optimise the timing of humane endpoints, indicate disease signs earlier and thereby improve animal welfare in both animal experimentation and in aquaculture settings. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines how flashback nudging—a reminder of past pro-environmental actions—delivered through a chatbot survey over 6 weeks in a quasi-experimental design, can facilitate pro-environmental behavior spillover among tourists visiting nature-based destinations. Integrating conversational artificial intelligence allows for personalized, timely, and scalable interventions, making the delivery of flashback nudges more efficient and engaging than traditional methods. Flashback nudging effectively strengthens the impact of environmental self-identity on behavioral change. Although nudges take time to work, the multigroup analysis revealed significant differences in self-reported past pro-environmental behaviors between the treatment and control groups. The findings demonstrate the importance of deliberate, technology-enabled interventions in enhancing meaning-making processes and promoting transformative tourism experiences. Artificial intelligence advances behavior change efforts by enabling innovative, lasting environmental engagement. This study emphasizes the potential of conversational artificial intelligence to drive tourism’s contributions to a sustainable future, advancing the discourse on leveraging technology for behavioral interventions in tourism. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Purpose: The journey through beats and bytes of artificial intelligence (AI)-infused electronic dance music (EDM) production is more than just a technical indication; it is a celebration of innovation. The recent EDM surge in India has sparked interest, particularly among teenagers. This contrasts with the country’s rich tradition of diverse musical genres. This study aims to explore the shift in behaviour of EDM artists toward AI and how it influences teenagers in India, including its potential benefits and risks, which remain under explored. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-methods approach was used, comprising quantitative surveys (n = 275), qualitative focus group discussions with youngsters (n = 32) and semi-structured interviews with EDM professionals (n = 12). A combination of thematic analysis and statistical methods was employed to analyze the data, utilizing IBM SPSS version 28.0. Findings: The findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of India’s evolving musical landscape, particularly the intersection of AI and EDM. The findings illuminate how EDM shapes teen identity, how AI is amalgamated into EDM and how the production and consumption of EDM influence both EDM artists and young consumers. Practical implications: The integration of AI technologies enables EDM artists to enhance creativity, streamline production processes and elevate the quality of their work, ensuring a competitive edge in the evolving music industry. AI fosters innovative trends and immerses teenagers in new experiences; However, the industry must address the positive and negative impacts on teenagers. It also recommends increased AI involvement in music production alongside policies addressing ethical concerns such as copyright, ownership of AI-generated EDM tracks, educational policies and public awareness campaigns. Originality/value: The study’s novelty lies in its offering unique insights into India’s evolving musical landscape and providing valuable resources for policymakers, educators and music industry professionals. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Persuasive games, designed and tailored to change users’ behavior, have enhanced user experience across various domains. However, their role in emotion regulation remains understudied, despite the increasingly immersive environments they create that trigger emotional responses. Sensors have emerged as key artificial intelligence (AI) tools in persuasive games supporting emotion regulation compared to other AI technologies, such as chatbots. Yet the effectiveness, challenges, and applications of these sensors lack comprehensive exploration. Our scoping review analyzed 32 articles published from 2013 to 2023 on persuasive games using AI-based sensing technologies for emotion regulation. Results from 27 articles (84.8%) reporting the effectiveness of sensors revealed mostly large to moderate effects (d ≥ 0.8 ≤ 0.4). Common challenges with integrated sensors (camera systems, facial recognition, smartwatches, and altimetric pressure sensors) included emotion detection accuracy and ethical concerns. We provide design recommendations for developing ethically sound and effective persuasive games for emotion regulation in the future. © 2025 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are providing a wealth of opportunities for improving clinical practice and healthcare delivery. It is predicted by AI experts that healthcare will change more in the next decade than it has in the previous century due to the volume and speed of these advancing capabilities. In this paper, we will illustrate the potential value of AI by sharing an example of an AI-powered digital health platform, designed to support people living with chronic cardiometabolic conditions and their care teams. The goal is to transform the care continuum from prevention through diagnosis, treatment, and ongoing management, including efficient acute care interventions when needed. The intent is to shift from reactive to proactive care including preventive-based guidance and interventions. AI-powered health technologies enable true person-centered care (i.e., for N=1), but for entire populations at scale (i.e., N >> 1), shifting the traditional mass generalization paradigm to one of mass customization. We demonstrate how an AI-powered digital health platform: 1) supports early detection and diagnosis of chronic conditions such as diabetes and related cardiometabolic conditions with data and insights; 2) optimizes personalized treatment; 3) tracks progress; 4) provides education; and 5) enables longitudinal behavior change to sustain health. We will present current AI capabilities as well as future considerations for the industry. We will also discuss principles that govern the responsible adoption of AI capabilities in healthcare to complement, not replace, the clinician. Copyright © 2025 Shomali, Kumbara, MacLeod and Iyer.

AB  - The field of mental health application research is growing, yet comprehensive, long-term studies validating claims of stress reduction and mood enhancement are limited, with many apps lacking empirical evidence. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an mHealth application called SmileApp to promote positive mood as a means of reducing stress. The design of SmileApp is grounded in psychological theories and integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and persuasive technology (PT). To evaluate SmileApp, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study involving 72 participants. This was followed by an optional semi-structured interview with 23 participants. Quantitative results suggest that SmileApp is usable, useful, and encourages users to smile more frequently. Furthermore, qualitative results suggest that SmileApp was a unique design to help users alleviate stress. These results offer valuable insights into innovative approaches for designing mHealth applications that promote positive mood. Moreover, the findings underscore the importance of utilising technology to support emotional well-being. We present a novel approach to promote desired behaviours by motivating users to read supportive messages and playing mobile games through the act of smiling. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Effective support from personal assistive technologies relies on accurate user models that capture user values, preferences, and context. Knowledge-based techniques model these relationships, enabling support agents to align their actions with user values. However, understanding values in a single context is insufficient due to the dynamic nature of behaviour. This study explores the use of dialogue strategies to update user models. Participants were randomly assigned to different strategies and they discussed one randomly chosen non-adherence situation with the agent. Then, their emotions, acquired information accuracy, completeness, and dialogue experience were rated. Our findings suggest that multiple-choice dialogues may limit response depth, reducing the perceived completeness of behaviour reasons. In contrast, open-ended questions allow more detailed input but require more time and effort, potentially worsening the dialogue experience. Through inductive coding, we identified key topics, such as individual challenges, priorities, tangible outcomes, and values, essential for constructing personalised user models. We also analyzed conversation paths to improve dialogue-based user model updates in support agents. Further research is needed to refine the relationship between dialogue strategies and self-conscious emotions, considering diverse backgrounds and health goals, while enhancing dialogue design. © 2025 The Author(s).

AB  - The creative advertising industry (CAI) is facing a pivotal moment, grappling with challenges like mergers and acquisitions, technological shifts, consumer behaviour changes, and evolving client-agency dynamics. These factors have strained relationships and understanding between clients and agencies, leading to a decline in mutual trust. This research examines how to leverage the potential of employing future-forward strategies in the form of a novel large language advertising model brain (LLAMB) to bridge this gap and revitalise these relationships. By incorporating advanced artificial intelligence (AI), LLAMB aims to enhance strategic communication and build trust and relationships, potentially driving business success in the digital era). The study will dive deep into the relevant literature and employ a mixed-method approach, blending quantitative and qualitative surveys and analysis, to test the LLAMB theoretical prototype. This theoretical prototype will uncover the hypothesis that better client-agency relationships can be cultivated through strategic and collaborative communication and to create value using technology. The findings will showcase LLAMB's ability to deepen client-agency bonds and nurture business growth, ensuring the CAI remains relevant in a data-dominated landscape. This research contributes to the ongoing discussion on AI's transformative role in advertising, providing strategic insights for future industry leaders and emphasising the need for innovative, AI-integrated solutions to maintain industry prominence and cultivate lasting innovation. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Nadya Shaznay Patel and Nitin Indurkhya; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Artificially intelligent technologies have become a common topic in our everyday discussions where arguments about the subject can take different forms from cognitive reasoning to emotional expressions. Utilizing persuasion theories and research on the appeal of content characteristics as the theoretical approach to examine affective–cognitive language, we investigated social media posts on artificial intelligence (AI). We examined Reddit posts from 2005 to 2018 referring to AI (N = 455,634) using automated content analysis tools. The results revealed that although both the tone positivity and affective–cognitive ratio were dependent on the specific context, the language in AI posts was more analytically than emotionally oriented in general. Other users were more likely to engage with Reddit posts on AI that were high in cognitive and analytic content compared to affective and emotional content. In addition to the practical contribution of public opinion on AI, the results contribute to the theoretical discussions on affective and cognitive language in social media discussions. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Laypeople have easy access to health information through large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and search engines, such as Google. Search engines transformed health information access, and LLMs offer a new avenue for answering laypeople’s questions. Objective: We aimed to compare the frequency of use and attitudes toward LLMs and search engines as well as their comparative relevance, usefulness, ease of use, and trustworthiness in responding to health queries. Methods: We conducted a screening survey to compare the demographics of LLM users and nonusers seeking health information, analyzing results with logistic regression. LLM users from the screening survey were invited to a follow-up survey to report the types of health information they sought. We compared the frequency of use of LLMs and search engines using ANOVA and Tukey post hoc tests. Lastly, paired-sample Wilcoxon tests compared LLMs and search engines on perceived usefulness, ease of use, trustworthiness, feelings, bias, and anthropomorphism. Results: In total, 2002 US participants recruited on Prolific participated in the screening survey about the use of LLMs and search engines. Of them, 52% (n=1045) of the participants were female, with a mean age of 39 (SD 13) years. Participants were 9.7% (n=194) Asian, 12.1% (n=242) Black, 73.3% (n=1467) White, 1.1% (n=22) Hispanic, and 3.8% (n=77) were of other races and ethnicities. Further, 1913 (95.6%) used search engines to look up health queries versus 642 (32.6%) for LLMs. Men had higher odds (odds ratio [OR] 1.63, 95% CI 1.34-1.99; P<.001) of using LLMs for health questions than women. Black (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.42-2.54; P<.001) and Asian (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.19-2.30; P<.01) individuals had higher odds than White individuals. Those with excellent perceived health (OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.1-1.93; P=.01) were more likely to use LLMs than those with good health. Higher technical proficiency increased the likelihood of LLM use (OR 1.26, 95% CI 1.14-1.39; P<.001). In a follow-up survey of 281 LLM users for health, most participants used search engines first (n=174, 62%) to answer health questions, but the second most common first source consulted was LLMs (n=39, 14%). LLMs were perceived as less useful (P<.01) and less relevant (P=.07), but elicited fewer negative feelings (P<.001), appeared more human (LLM: n=160, vs search: n=32), and were seen as less biased (P<.001). Trust (P=.56) and ease of use (P=.27) showed no differences. Conclusions: Search engines are the primary source of health information; yet, positive perceptions of LLMs suggest growing use. Future work could explore whether LLM trust and usefulness are enhanced by supplementing answers with external references and limiting persuasive language to curb overreliance. Collaboration with health organizations can help improve the quality of LLMs’ health output. ©Tamir Mendel, Nina Singh, Devin M Mann, Batia Wiesenfeld, Oded Nov.

AB  - This article investigates the potential misuse of large language models (LLM) for low-resource, highly personalised social engineering attacks. The study explores how ChatGPT can infer personality traits during natural conversations by leveraging publicly available personal information, such as social media data, as an entry point. Utilising the social engineering personality framework (SEPF), the research endeavours to optimise attack vectors based on the Big Five personality traits, with the objective of enhancing the persuasiveness of social engineering strategies. The approach is divided into four phases: verifying conversational capabilities, conducting personality analyses, applying the SEPF for attack optimisation, and evaluating the persuasiveness of personalised attacks. The present paper offers a proof-of-principle for the initial phase, demonstrating ChatGPT’s capacity to engage in natural conversations while conducting personality analyses in a discreet manner. The findings indicate that while ChatGPT exhibits the capacity to simulate human-like interactions, limitations in conversational variance and the reliability of personality assessment were observed. The study identifies challenges such as generalisations, lack of score differentiation, and confirmation bias, and proposes refinements like increasing interaction depth, adjusting scoring scales, and using tailored personas. Subsequent research will investigate enhanced personality inference techniques, personalisation of attack vectors, and their impact on susceptibility to social engineering attacks. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - The promotion of mental health is essential for global health, affecting millions with disorders such as anxiety and depression. Although stigma and discrimination hinder progress, these conditions are often preventable or manageable at minimal cost. The adoption of digital tools in mental health promotion, including telemedicine, online therapy, social media, and wearables, offers promising new avenues to address these issues. This review proposes a framework that focuses on the use of digital tools to enhance health literacy, foster behavioral change, and support sustained positive health behaviors. Platforms such as TikTok, Facebook, and Instagram can effectively disseminate health information, increase awareness, and enhance social accountability. Artificial intelligence-driven virtual agents offer personalised mental health interventions, providing motivational support and customised advice. Additionally, wearable technology (e.g., fitness trackers and smartwatches) enables real-time monitoring of vital health metrics, encouraging ongoing healthy activities. Nonetheless, these technologies introduce challenges including privacy issues, data security, and equitable access to digital resources, raising a new class of rights to protect mental privacy, guard against algorithm bias, and prevent personality-changing manipulations. The absence of human interaction in fully digital solutions also raises concerns about a lack of empathy and emotional connection. For optimal use of digital tools in mental health, integration with conventional care practices and adaptation to diverse cultural and social backgrounds are necessary. The results of this review suggest that digital tools, when carefully implemented, can significantly improve mental health outcomes by making care more accessible, tailored, and effective, especially for underserved communities. 2025 Coelho, Pécune, Micoulaud-Franchi, Bioulac and Philip.

AB  - Background: The global prevalence of diabetes mellitus is escalating rapidly. Similarly in Malaysia, diabetes prevalence among adults rose exponentially. Artificial intelligence (AI) integrated into mobile health applications (apps) presents a promising avenue for enhancing diabetes management through personalized patient education and behaviour modification. However, adoption rates remain low, primarily due to limited awareness and technological challenges, especially among older adults. Objective: This study aimed to explore Malaysian healthcare professionals’ (HCPs’) perspectives on the use of AI in mobile apps for diabetes education and behavioural management. Methods: Qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with 19 HCPs across Malaysia. Interviews were conducted via video conferencing, recorded, transcribed, and analysed using thematic analysis with NVivo 14 software. Results: Seven key themes emerged: (1) acceptance and trust, (2) impact on patient behaviour, (3) skills and abilities required, (4) problems and obstacles, (5) key features and functions, (6) HCPs’ and patients’ information needs, and (7) strategies for increasing patient adoption. HCPs expressed positive sentiments towards AI-based apps, highlighting their potential for continuous, personalized education and real-time feedback. However, significant concerns were raised about accessibility for older adults, data privacy, and the apps’ ability to modify entrenched behaviours without human intervention. Conclusion: AI-based mobile apps show potential for improving diabetes management, but successful implementation requires addressing challenges. Strategies should focus on developing user-friendly interfaces, providing comprehensive education for patients and providers, and ensuring robust data protection. Future research should quantify the impact on patient outcomes and explore effective integration of human support with AI capabilities. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Background: Heart failure (HF) is a chronic, progressive condition where the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body’s needs. In addition to the daily challenges that HF poses, acute exacerbations can lead to costly hospitalizations and increased mortality. High health care costs and the burden of HF have led to the emerging application of new technologies to support people living with HF to stay well while living in the community. However, many digital solutions have not involved consumers and health care professionals in their design, leading to poor adoption. The SmartHeart project aimed to codevelop a smart health ecosystem to support the early detection of HF deterioration and encourage self-care, potentially preventing hospitalizations. Objective: This study aims to provide an overview of the SmartHeart project by describing our approach to designing the SmartHeart system, outlining its features, and describing the planned pilot study to determine the feasibility of the system. Methods: We used the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework to guide the development of the SmartHeart system, involving users (people with HF and their caregivers) and stakeholders (health care providers involved in the management of HF) in its design. SmartHeart is a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system. It includes 2 user interfaces for patients: an Amazon Alexa conversational agent and a smartphone app. The system collects physiological, symptom, and behavioral data through wireless sensors and self-reports from users. These data are processed and analyzed to provide personalized health insights, self-care support, and alerts in case of health deterioration. The system also includes a web-based user interface for health care professionals, allowing them to access data, send messages to users, and receive notifications about potential health deterioration. A single-arm, multicenter pilot trial (N=20) is planned to determine the feasibility and acceptability of SmartHeart before evaluation through a randomized controlled trial. The primary outcome will be a description of the study's feasibility (recruitment, attrition, engagement, and changes in self-care). Results: The SmartHeart study started in January 2021 on procurement of funding. Recruitment for the pilot trial started in August 2024 and will be completed by March 2025. We have currently enrolled 12 participants. Follow-up of all participants will be completed by the end of May 2025. Conclusions: We have co-designed and developed a complete remote heart health monitoring and automated feedback delivery system for the early detection of HF deterioration and prevention of HF-related hospitalizations. The next step is a pilot study, which will provide valuable information on feasibility and preliminary effects to inform a larger evaluation trial. SmartHeart has the potential to augment existing health services and help people with HF stay well while living in the community. ©Ralph Maddison, Rebecca Nourse, Reza Daryabeygikhotbehsara, Teketo Kassaw Tegegne, Paul Jansons, Jonathan Charles Rawstorn, John Atherton, Andrea Driscoll, Brian Oldenburg, Rajesh Vasa, Vassilis Kostakos, Tilman Dingler, Gavin Abbott, Paul Scuffham, Jo-Anne Elizabeth Manski-Nankervis, Dominika Kwasnicka, Finn Kensing, Sheikh Mohammed Shariful Islam, Anthony Maeder, Yuxin Zhang.

AB  - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) and smart/e-tourism provide imperative opportunities to service industries; however, the implementation of ChatGPT in the tourism and hospitality industry is limited, which extends different considerations/challenges that need vigilant reflection. Based on this significance and research gap, we thus develop a theoretical framework which suggests different sets of key research propositions in AI technology-powered ChatGPT. A widespread literature review and practices were conducted to investigate the conceptual advancements/developments on generative AI-powered technologies including ChatGPT, chatbot in marketing, tourism, hospitality and information management. The proposed framework suggests generative AI technology-powered ChatGPT develops customer’s interaction-based conditions including experience, engagement/trust, attachment, satisfaction/service quality, attitude change and operational efficiency, which consequently affect their strategic outcomes including behaviours, subjective/psychological well-being, happiness and performance. Thus, this research note suggests theoretical/practical implications to provide an extensive future-research roadmap on AI technology-powered ChatGPT and also recommends transformative opportunities, challenges and benefits in tourism, hospitality and marketing management. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study examines antecedents that drive platform users to manipulate artificial intelligence (AI) recommendation algorithms. Based on the persuasion knowledge model (PKM), survey data collected from YouTube and Instagram users reveal that AI manipulation intentions are positively affected by persuasion knowledge about AI and perceived interactivity. Perceived interactivity is associated with higher perceived benefits and lower perceived costs of AI manipulation, consequently affecting manipulation intentions. A multivariate analysis of variance shows variations in intentions to use different types of AI manipulation behaviors among users with varying levels of persuasion knowledge. The research contributes to the PKM and AI-human interaction literature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: The integration of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics into mental health offers innovative perspectives on understanding and addressing psychological disorders. This overview aims to synthesize current knowledge and explore the implications of these interdisciplinary approaches in the context of mental health. Method: In this narrative review, we summarized the current evidence regarding the applications of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics approaches in the field of mental health. Results: Behavioral economics and neuroeconomics provide valuable insights into the cognitive and emotional processes underlying mental health disorders, such as irrational decision-making, impulsivity, and self-control issues. Concepts such as loss aversion, temporal discounting, and framing effects inform the development of innovative interventions and policy initiatives. Behavioral economic interventions, including nudges, incentives, and commitment devices, show promise in promoting treatment adherence, reducing risky behaviors, and enhancing mental well-being. Neuroeconomics contributes by identifying neural markers predictive of treatment response and relapse risk, paving the way for personalized treatment approaches. Conclusion: The integration of behavioral economics and neuroeconomics into mental health research and practice holds significant potential for improving the understanding of psychological disorders and developing more effective, personalized interventions. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of action, optimize intervention strategies, and address ethical considerations associated with these approaches in mental health settings. © 2025 Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: Women of childbearing age (aged 18-44 years) face multiple barriers to receiving screening and treatment for unhealthy alcohol and substance use, depression, and anxiety, including lack of screening in the primary care setting and lack of support in accessing care. The Women Empowered to Connect with Addiction Resources and Engage in Evidence-based Treatment (WE-CARE) mobile app was developed to test universal screening with women of childbearing age and linkage to care after an anonymous assessment. Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the feasibility and acceptability of providing anonymous screening instruments through mobile phones for alcohol and substance use, as well as depression and anxiety, for women of childbearing age. Methods: We used agile development principles based on previous formative research to test WE-CARE mobile health app with women of childbearing age (N=30) who resided in 1 of 6 counties in central Florida. WE-CARE included screening instruments (for alcohol, substance use, depression, and anxiety), a moderated discussion forum, educational microlearning videos, a frequently asked questions section, and resources for linkage to treatment. Individuals were recruited using flyers, academic listserves, and a commercial human subject recruiting company (Prolific). Upon completion of the screening instruments, women explored the educational and linkage to care features of the app and filled out a System Usability Scale to evaluate the mobile health app’s usability and acceptability. Postpilot semistructured interviews (n=4) were conducted to further explore the women’s reactions to the app. Results: A total of 77 women downloaded the application and 30 completed testing. Women of childbearing age gave the WE-CARE app an excellent System Usability Scale score of 86.7 (SD 12.43). Our results indicate elevated risk for substance use in 18 of the 30 (60%) participants, 9/18 (50%) also had an elevated risk for anxiety or depression, and 11/18 (61%) had an elevated risk for substance use, anxiety, or depression. Participants reported that WE-CARE was easy to navigate and use but they would have liked to see more screening questions and more educational content. Linkage to care was an issue; however, as none of the women identified as “at-risk” for substance use disorders contacted the free treatment clinic for further evaluation. Conclusions: The mobile health app was highly rated for acceptability and usability, but participants were not receptive to seeking help at a treatment center after only a few brief encounters with the app. The linkage to care design features was likely insufficient to encourage them to seek treatment. The next version of WE-CARE will include normative scores for participants to self-evaluate their screening status compared with their age- and gender-matched peers and enhanced linkages to care features. Future development will focus on enhancing engagement to improve change behaviors and assess readiness for change. © Krystyna Isaacs, Autumn Shifflett, Kajal Patel, Lacey Karpisek, Yi Cui, Maayan Lawental, Golfo Tzilos Wernette, Brian Borsari, Katie Chang, Tony Ma.

AB  - Psychological Insulin Resistance (PIR) is described as the reluctance towards initiation and adherence of insulin-based treatments due to psychological barriers in diabetic patients. Though studies have shown that timely initiation with lifestyle changes is crucial in sugar control and prevention of chronic conditions in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) patients, many patients often have deep-rooted fears and misgivings related to insulin which hinder them from adapting to an insulin-based treatment regimen when recommended by healthcare specialists. Therefore, it is vitally important to address and allay these fallacious beliefs in T2D patients and persuade them to consider insulin as a treatment option. In this paper, we describe the design of PIRsuader, a persuasive chatbot for mitigating PIR in T2D patients. In PIRsuader, we effectively harness the conversation generation capabilities of state-of-the-art Large Language Models via a context-specific persuasive dialog act schema. We design reward functions that capture dialog act preferences for persuading reluctant patients and apply reinforcement learning to learn a dialog act prediction model. Our experiments using a collection of real doctor-diabetic patient conversations indicate that PIRsuader is able to improve the willingness in patients to try insulin as well as address specific concerns they have in an empathetic manner. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Information disorder (IDO) presents a persistent challenge to society, necessitating innovative approaches to understanding its dynamics beyond just merely detecting it. This study introduces a theory-driven framework that integrates advanced natural language processing (NLP) with deep learning, utilizing the target-based emotion–stance analysis (TESA) approach to analyze emotion and stance dynamics within IDO content. Complementing TESA, interactive graph generation (IGG) is applied for scalable and interpretable qualitative analyses. Employing a mixed-methods approach, the study leverages TESA for target-centric emotion and stance analysis, evaluating target-based classifiers on both human-annotated and synthetic datasets. Additionally, the study explores synthetic data generation using generative AI to enrich the analysis, applying IGG to map complex data interactions. The study also found that integrating synthetic data developed from human annotations enhanced model performance, particularly for emotion classification tasks. Results demonstrate that IDO narratives significantly differ from non-IDO narratives, frequently leveraging negative emotions such as anger and disgust to manipulate public perception. TESA proved effective in capturing these nuanced variations, while IGG facilitated the triangulation of such findings via the scalable interpretation of emotional narratives, revealing that IDO content often amplifies polarizing and antagonistic perspectives. By combining TESA and IGG, this research emphasizes the importance of using NLP to extract and examine the emotional and stance nuances toward targets of interest within IDO context. This approach not only deepens theoretical insights into IDO’s persuasive mechanisms but also supports the development of practical tools for analyzing and managing the influence of IDO on public discourse. © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Objectives. This article explores teacher readiness for introducing artificial intelligence (AI) into Sri Lankan schools, drawing on self-efficacy theory. Similar to some other countries, Sri Lanka plans to integrate AI into the school curriculum soon. However, a key question remains: Are teachers prepared to teach this advanced technical subject to schoolchildren? Assessing teacher readiness is crucial, as it is intricately linked to the overall success of this initiative and will inform the development of appropriate policies.Participants. This study surveyed over 1,300 Sri Lankan public school teachers who teach Information and Communication Technology (ICT) using the snowball sampling approach. The respondents represent approximately 20% of the total ICT teacher population in Sri Lanka. Their readiness to teach AI was assessed using a general teacher self-efficacy scale specifically developed based on the well-established Self-Efficacy Theory. While key demographic factors like gender, education level and educational background were also collected, their impact analysis is not included in this article.Study Method. The study was conducted based on the premise that teachers' readiness to teach AI hinges on their self-efficacy towards teaching AI in the classroom. This premise was substantiated through a review of existing research, and a conceptual model of teachers' self-efficacy for AI instruction was developed. To assess this model, a nationwide survey targeting school ICT teachers was conducted. The questionnaire used in the survey was based on existing research on evaluating teacher self-efficacy. Data analysis, focusing on testing and validating the conceptual model, primarily employed the PLS-SEM approach.Findings. This study identified several key findings: (1) Teachers generally reported low self-efficacy regarding their ability to teach AI; (2) Teachers' self-efficacy was most influenced by their emotional and physiological states, as well as their imaginary experiences related to teaching AI; (3) Surprisingly, mastery experiences had a lesser impact on their self-efficacy for teaching AI; and (4) Neither vicarious experiences (observing others teach AI) nor verbal persuasion had a significant impact on teachers' self-efficacy. Additionally, the study revealed that the teachers' own level of expertise in AI, along with their social capital, is insufficient to deliver a standard AI curriculum.Conclusions. The analysis of the results found that Sri Lankan teachers currently lack the readiness to teach AI in schools effectively. Potential lapses in certain sources of self-efficacy were also identified. It further revealed the need for a more systemic approach to teacher professional development. Therefore, the study recommends further research exploring the potential of incorporating a socio-technical systems perspective into the government's teacher training initiatives.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Writing arguments is a challenging task for both humans and machines. It entails incorporating high-level beliefs from various perspectives on the topic, along with deliberate reasoning and planning to construct a coherent narrative. Current language models often generate outputs autoregressively, lacking explicit integration of these underlying controls, resulting in limited output diversity and coherence. In this work, we propose a persona-based multi-agent framework for argument writing. Inspired by the human debate, we first assign each agent a persona representing its high-level beliefs from a unique perspective, and then design an agent interaction process so that the agents can collaboratively debate and discuss the idea to form an overall plan for argument writing. Such debate process enables fluid and nonlinear development of ideas. We evaluate our framework on argumentative essay writing. The results show that our framework generates more diverse and persuasive arguments by both automatic and human evaluations. © 2025 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Persuasive technologies, which are intended to change users' attitudes or behaviors and encourage specific actions, are widely applied across various domains. However, the fine line between persuasion and coercion raises significant ethical concerns, which current literature only superficially addresses. This paper aims to deepen the understanding of factors influencing the ethical perception of persuasive technologies through a systematic literature review of 17 journal articles. The selected studies were analyzed using content analysis to identify key ethical factors. The findings indicate that factors such as autonomy, consent, data privacy, transparency, and addictive design strategies significantly influence users' ethical perceptions across multiple application domains. Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technologies or AI agents, particularly applications like argumentative chatbots and storytelling robots, exhibit the highest number of ethical considerations. The study also notes thematic overlaps among many ethical factors, with the context and use case impacting ethical perceptions. Based on these results, this paper offers design recommendations and suggestions for the design of ethical persuasive technology applications. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This paper introduces text-to-shape-display, a novel approach to generating dynamic shape changes in pin-based shape displays through natural language commands. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and AI-chaining, our approach allows users to author shape-changing behaviors on demand through text prompts without programming. We describe the foundational aspects necessary for such a system, including the identification of key generative elements (primitive, animation, and interaction) and design requirements to enhance user interaction, based on formative exploration and iterative design processes. Based on these insights, we develop SHAPE-IT, an LLM-based authoring tool for a 24 x 24 shape display, which translates the user's textual command into executable code and allows for quick exploration through a web-based control interface. We evaluate the effectiveness of SHAPE-IT in two ways: 1) performance evaluation and 2) user evaluation (N= 10). The study conclusions highlight the ability to facilitate rapid ideation of a wide range of shape-changing behaviors with AI. However, the findings also expose accuracy-related challenges and limitations, prompting further exploration into refining the framework for leveraging AI to better suit the unique requirements of shape-changing systems.  © 2024 ACM.

AB  - To improve medication adherence, we co-developed a digital, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven nudge intervention with stakeholders (patients, providers, and technologists). We used a human-centred design approach to incorporate user needs in creating an AI-driven nudge tool. We report the findings of the first stage of a multi-phase project: understanding user needs and ideating solutions. We interviewed healthcare providers (n = 10) and patients (n = 10). Providers also rated example nudge interventions in a survey. Stakeholders felt the intervention could address existing deficits in medication adherence tracking and were optimistic about the solution. Participants identified flexibility of the intervention, including mode of delivery, intervention intensity, and the ability to stratify to user ability and needs, as critical success factors. Reminder nudges and provision of healthcare worker contact were rated highly by all. Conversely, patients perceived incentive-based nudges poorly. Finally, participants suggested that user burden could be minimised by leveraging existing software (rather than creating a new App) and simplifying or automating the data entry requirements where feasible. Stakeholder interviews generated in-depth data on the perspectives and requirements for the proposed solution. The participatory approach will enable us to incorporate user needs into the design and improve the utility of the intervention. Our findings show that an AI-driven nudge tool is an acceptable and appropriate solution, assuming it is flexible to user requirements. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Automated persuasion systems (APS) are conversational agents that exchange arguments and counterarguments with users during dialogues to persuade them to believe in something. Such systems use strategies (or policies) to carefully select a sequence of arguments that are tailored to the user’s needs and will likely have a positive outcome, that is, changing the user’s belief in a certain argument. Biparty Decision Theory (BDT) is a framework that uses game theory to formalize a dialogue between an APS and a user, that is, an exchange of (counter) arguments during each turn of the APS or the user. During the APS turn, the BDT policy selects the best argument to maximize only the utility for the APS and neglects the utility of that argument for the user. This is a reasonable choice in games, but in a persuasive dialogue, it can result in arguments that have a high utility for the APS but a modest utility for the user. There the user may be less likely to be persuaded. This is crucial in settings where there are no arguments with good utilities for both the APS and the user and a compromise has to be found. To this extent, we define a new family of policies for BDT, called aggregated policies, that consider, during the decisions of the APS, an aggregation of the APS and user’s utilities. Such an aggregation considers both the APS and the user’s needs leading toward a sequence of arguments representing the best trade-off of utilities. We evaluate the approach using both a new synthetic dataset and a published dataset of utilities for dialogical argumentation. The results show the aggregated policies find better compromise arguments w.r.t. the classical policy of BDT. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Infant growth predicts long-term obesity and cardiovascular disease. Previous interventions designed to prevent obesity in the first 2 years of life have been largely unsuccessful. Obesity prevalence is high among traditional racial and ethnic minority groups. OBJECTIVE To compare the effectiveness of adding a digital childhood obesity prevention intervention to health behavior counseling delivered by pediatric primary care clinicians. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Individually randomized, parallel-group trial conducted at 6 US medical centers and enrolling patients shortly after birth. To be eligible, parents spoke English or Spanish, and children were born after 34 weeks’ gestational age. Study enrollment occurred between October 2019 and January 2022, with follow-up through January 2024. INTERVENTIONS In the clinic-based health behavior counseling (clinic-only) group, pediatric clinicians used health literacy–informed booklets at well-child visits to promote healthy behaviors (n = 451). In the clinic + digital intervention group, families also received health literacy–informed, individually tailored, responsive text messages to support health behavior goals and a web-based dashboard (n = 449). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was child weight-for-length trajectory over 24 months. Secondary outcomes included weight-for-length z score, body mass index (BMI) z score, and the percentage of children with overweight or obesity. RESULTS Of 900 randomized children, 86.3% had primary outcome data at the 24-month follow-up time point; 143 (15.9%) were Black, non-Hispanic; 405 (45.0%) were Hispanic; 185 (20.6%) were White, non-Hispanic; and 165 (18.3%) identified as other or multiple races and ethnicities. Children in the clinic + digital intervention group had a lower mean weight-for-length trajectory, with an estimated reduction of 0.33 kg/m (95% CI, 0.09 to 0.57) at 24 months. There was also an adjusted mean difference of -0.19 (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.02) for weight-for-length z score and -0.19 (95% CI, -0.36 to -0.01) for BMI z score. At age 24 months, 23.2% of the clinic + digital intervention group compared with 24.5% of the clinic-only group had overweight or obesity (adjusted risk ratio, 0.91 [95% CI, 0.70 to 1.17]) based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria of BMI 85th percentile or greater. At that age, 7.4% of the clinic + digital intervention group compared with 12.7% of the clinic-only group had obesity (adjusted risk ratio, 0.56 [95% CI, 0.36 to 0.88]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A health literacy–informed digital intervention improved child weight-for-length trajectory across the first 24 months of life and reduced childhood obesity at 24 months. The intervention was effective in a racially and ethnically diverse population that included groups at elevated risk for childhood obesity. © 2024 American Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research investigates the use of artificial intelligence (AI) tools by Indonesian EFL learners to enhance their presentation skills through self-regulated learning. With the rapid advancement of AI technologies, their integration into educational practices has become increasingly significant, particularly in developing essential skills like presentation delivery. This study aims to explore how Indonesian EFL learners prioritize specific aspects of presentation skills and how AI tools facilitate their self-regulated learning processes. Employing a qualitative approach, semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions were conducted with twelve participants to gather in-depth insights into their experiences and perceptions regarding AI tools. Findings indicate that learners prioritize pronunciation clarity, persuasive topic development, fluent coherence, precise lexical usage, and grammatical accuracy as essential components for effective presentations. Participants reported valuing AI for its ability to provide personalized feedback and improve learning efficiency. This research underscores the potential of AI technologies in enhancing language learning and presentation skills, suggesting that educational practices should integrate AI-supported interventions to boost learners' competence and confidence in public speaking. © 2025, Duzce University, Faculty of Education.

AB  - Background: Minority populations are utilizing mobile health applications more frequently to access health information. One group that may benefit from using mHealth technology is underserved women, specifically those on community supervision. Objective: Discuss methodological approaches for navigating digital health strategies to address underserved women's health disparities. Description of the innovative method: Using an intersectional lens, we identified strategies for conducting research using digital health technology and artificial intelligence amongst the underserved, particularly those with community supervision. Description of its effectiveness: We explore (1) methodological approaches that combine traditional research methods with precision medicine, digital phenotyping, and ecological momentary assessment; (2) implications for artificial intelligence; and (3) ethical considerations with data collection, storage, and engagement. Discussion: Researchers must address gendered differences related to health, social, and economic disparities concurrently with an unwavering focus on the protection of human subjects when addressing the unique needs of underserved women while utilizing digital health methodologies. Public contribution: Women on community supervision in South Central Texas helped inform the design of JUN, the mHealth app we reported in the case exemplar. JUN is named after the Junonia shell, a native shell to South Texas, which means strength, power, and self-sufficiency, like the participants in our preliminary studies. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Although viewpoint diversity is a keyvalue for audiences, journalism and media policy, not much is known about how audiences process and evaluate it. This is critical because any positive effect we might expect from a broad range of views (e.g., on opinion formation) requires that recipients recognize and appreciate it as a part of news content. The current study examines how news readers process and evaluate argument diversity as a specific aspect of viewpoint diversity. In a 2 × 2 × 2 between-subject experiment, 1363 subjects were exposed to news reports containing a diverse or homogenous set of arguments in the context of two currently debated issues (artificial intelligence and immigration). Reports were either published by a single or multiple media outlets to determine potential differences between internal and external argument diversity. We find that readers not only recognize the presence of argument diversity, but that it leads to an increase in overall news satisfaction. This increase can be attributed to a higher credibility of news reports with diverse arguments. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose: Chatbots are vital for enhancing e-commerce sustainability by providing efficient customer support. Although previous studies have considered both linguistic and visual anthropomorphism as crucial factors in e-commerce chatbot design, their joint effects and their underlying mechanisms have not been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on insights from the literature on anthropomorphism and the elaboration likelihood model, this research attempts to examine the joint effects of the two types of anthropomorphism, the boundary condition, and the subsequent impact on purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: A research model was proposed and empirically tested using two laboratory-controlled experimental studies. Findings: Linguistic anthropomorphism plays a dominant role over visual anthropomorphism in influencing social presence and communicative effectiveness. In addition, linguistic anthropomorphism harms persuasion through the mediating role of communicative effectiveness, and the fit between linguistic and visual anthropomorphism amplifies the negative effect on purchase intention. Moreover, shopping motivation serves as a boundary condition for the negative effect of anthropomorphism. Practical implications: Chatbot designers should be cautious when using anthropomorphism in e-commerce chatbot design. The use of machine-like languages may be more persuasive than that of human-like languages, especially for utilitarian products. Notably, mismatched anthropomorphic elements may harm user experience. Originality/value: This study enriches chatbot literature by examining the role of chatbot anthropomorphism in the e-commerce context. Moreover, this study provides a more comprehensive framework for understanding how chatbots’ linguistic and visual anthropomorphism jointly influence consumer behavior. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) large language models (LLMs) now produce human-like general text and images. LLMs' ability to generate persuasive scientific essays that undergo evaluation under traditional peer review has not been systematically studied. To measure perceptions of quality and the nature of authorship, we conducted a competitive essay contest in 2024 with both human and AI participants. Human authors and 4 distinct LLMs generated essays on controversial topics in stroke care and outcomes research. A panel of Stroke Editorial Board members (mostly vascular neurologists), blinded to author identity and with varying levels of AI expertise, rated the essays for quality, persuasiveness, best in topic, and author type. Among 34 submissions (22 human and 12 LLM) scored by 38 reviewers, human and AI essays received mostly similar ratings, though AI essays were rated higher for composition quality. Author type was accurately identified only 50% of the time, with prior LLM experience associated with improved accuracy. In multivariable analyses adjusted for author attributes and essay quality, only persuasiveness was independently associated with odds of a reviewer assigning AI as author type (adjusted odds ratio, 1.53 [95% CI, 1.09-2.16]; P=0.01). In conclusion, a group of experienced editorial board members struggled to distinguish human versus AI authorship, with a bias against best in topic for essays judged to be AI generated. Scientific journals may benefit from educating reviewers on the types and uses of AI in scientific writing and developing thoughtful policies on the appropriate use of AI in authoring manuscripts.  © 2024 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Prevention of lifestyle diseases is an important issue in terms of both the lifelong well-being of each individual and the burden on society. Although several artificial-intelligence-based chatbots have been proposed to support preventing such diseases, they have not yet reached a complex problem setting that combines multiple theories of behavioral change. In such complex settings, in addition to intervention selection, it is important to reduce the amount of attributes acquired to reduce the user's burden in preventing inhibition of motivation. Therefore, we developed the Entropy-Based Planning algorithm that selects interventions from a small number of questions. To evaluate the algorithm, we conducted a short-term randomized control trial (RCT) with a small number of users as an initial validation. Due to certain limitations, we were unable to obtain results indicating sufficient effectiveness. However, important findings were obtained for the future development of behavioral-change support bots. The findings include the need to investigate the relevance of preferences among multiple behavior-change theories and balance the number of questions and accuracy of personalization on user impressions. We intend to conduct further research on the basis of these findings as well as conduct a large-scale RCT after improving the algorithm and experiment settings. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, Zika, and chikungunya cause significant morbidity and mortality globally, resulting in over 600,000 deaths from malaria and around 36,000 deaths from dengue each year, with millions of people infected annually, leading to substantial economic losses. The existing mosquito control measures, such as long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS), helped to reduce the infections. However, mosquito-borne diseases are still among the deadliest diseases, forcing us to improve the existing control methods and look for alternative methods simultaneously. Advanced monitoring techniques, including remote sensing, and geographic information systems (GIS) have significantly enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of mosquito control measures. Mosquitoes’ behavioural traits, such as locomotion, blood-feeding, and fertility are the key determinants of disease transmission and epidemiology. Technological advancements, such as high-resolution cameras, infrared imaging, and artificial intelligence (AI) driven object detection models, including groundbreaking convolutional neural networks, have provided efficient and precise options to monitor various mosquito behaviours, including locomotion, oviposition, fertility, and host-seeking. However, they are not commonly employed in mosquito-based research. This review highlights the novel and significant advancements in behaviour-monitoring tools, mostly from the last decade, due to cutting-edge video monitoring technology and artificial intelligence. These advancements can offer enhanced accuracy, efficiency, and the ability to quickly process large volumes of data, enabling detailed behavioural analysis over extended periods and large sample sizes, unlike traditional manual methods prone to human error and labour-intensive. The use of behaviour-assaying techniques can support or replace existing monitoring techniques and directly contribute to improving control measures by providing more accurate and real-time data on mosquito activity patterns and responses to interventions. This enhanced understanding can help establish the role of behavioural changes in improving epidemiological models, making them more precise and dynamic. As a result, mosquito management strategies can become more adaptive and responsive, leading to more effective and targeted interventions. Ultimately, this will reduce disease transmission and significantly improve public health outcomes. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: The evolving role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in medicine, particularly in radiology and population-based breast cancer screening programs, offers potential accuracy gains and efficiency improvements. However, successful implementation requires understanding of healthcare workers’ views on AI, which this study aims to explore within the Australian BreastScreen program. Methods: An online survey was distributed to clinical staff involved in breast imaging, collecting responses from November 2022 to April 2023. The survey encompassed demographic information, opinions, and experiences with AI in medical imaging, with questions covering various scenarios of AI integration in BreastScreen. Results: Out of an estimated 350 professionals contacted, 95 responded, with 84.2 % (80/95) being radiologists. Less than half of respondents (44.9 %, 40/89) had worked with artificial intelligence for image classification previously. The majority of radiologists 74.2 % (46/62) thought that the use of AI in reading mammograms for BreastScreen would improve workflow. However, radiologists thought they would behave with increasing caution with scenarios where AI was more autonomous, with the majority of radiologists (63.3 %, 38/60) uncomfortable with holding accountability when the AI was used to triage and remove cases from the workflow. Notably, 60 % of radiologists (36/60) expressed concerns about accountability. Discussion: The findings suggest an optimistic attitude towards AI among Australian healthcare workers, although when given hypothetical scenarios for the way AI could be integrated into BreastScreen, there was increasing caution with scenarios where AI was more autonomous. This study highlights understanding and concerns of healthcare professionals working in population screening which are important to address when implementing AI into the healthcare system. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - This systematic review and meta-analysis analyzed and summarized the growing literature on the effectiveness of chatbot-delivered interventions in increasing uptake, intention, and attitudes related to any type of vaccination. We identified randomized controlled studies (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, and non-experimental studies from the following platforms: PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, Global Health, APA PsycInfo, and EMBASE databases. A total of 12 eligible studies published from 2019 to 2023 were analyzed and summarized. In particular, one RCT showed that a chatbot-delivered tailored intervention was more effective than a chatbot-delivered non-tailored intervention in promoting seasonal influenza vaccine uptake among older adults (50.5% versus 35.3%, p = 0.002). Six RCTs were included in the meta-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of chatbot interventions to improve vaccination attitudes and intentions. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) of overall attitude change was 0.34 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.13, 0.55, p = 0.001). We found a non-significant trivial effect of chatbot interventions on improving intentions of vaccination (SMD: 0.11, 95% CI: −0.13, 0.34, p = 0.38). However, further evidence is needed to draw a more precise conclusion. Additionally, study participants reported high satisfaction levels of using the chatbot and were likely to recommend it to others. The development of chatbots is still nascent and rooms for improvement exist. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - While personalized advertising may increase customer’s desire to engage with a firm, privacy concerns over how firms process data for personalization may reduce their engagement and lead to ad avoidance. As marketers increasingly benefit from personalized advertising, the domain of privacy in personalized advertising (PPA) is gaining attention from researchers in both Marketing and Information Systems areas. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review from extant literature, combining bibliometric analysis and systematic literature review to explore the current state, primary themes, and future prospects of the PPA literature. Our research indicates that PPA research is in its early stages of development. While existing literature has predominantly examined privacy, personalization, trust, advertising, social media and e-commerce, there has been a growing emphasis on targeted advertising and artificial intelligence in more recent studies. PPA is grounded in theoretical frameworks from privacy like Privacy Calculus Theory and from marketing such as Persuasion Knowledge Model. Given that customer privacy concerns and trust in a firm can influence ad outcomes negatively, it is essential for researchers to explore scenarios where personalization might prove ineffective. In addition, examining firm strategies regarding personalized ads to mitigate negative ad outcomes is crucial. © 2025 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) is a subtype of dementia that manifests after the age of 65. It is characterized by progressive impairments in cognitive functions, behavioral changes, and learning difficulties. Given the progressive nature of the disease, early diagnosis is crucial. Early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) is solely attributable to genetic factors, whereas LOAD has multiple contributing factors. A complex pathway mechanism involving multiple factors contributes to LOAD progression. Employing a systems biology approach, our analysis encompassed the genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors that modulate the molecular networks and pathways. These factors affect the brain’s structural integrity, functional capacity, and connectivity, ultimately leading to the manifestation of the disease. This study has aggregated diverse biomarkers associated with factors capable of altering the molecular networks and pathways that influence brain structure, functionality, and connectivity. These biomarkers serve as potential early indicators for AD diagnosis and are designated as early biomarkers. The other biomarker datasets associated with the brain structure, functionality, connectivity, and related parameters of an individual are broadly categorized as clinical-stage biomarkers. This study has compiled research papers on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing machine learning (ML) methodologies from both categories of biomarker data, including the applications of ML techniques for AD diagnosis. The broad objectives of our study are research gap identification, assessment of biomarker efficacy, and the most effective or prevalent ML technology used in AD diagnosis. This paper examines the predominant use of deep learning (DL) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis utilizing various types of biomarker data. Furthermore, this study has addressed the potential scope of using generative AI and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) for data augmentation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: This review aimed to map the existing the information and communication technology (ICT)-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases and identify key effectiveness factors and guidelines for professionals. Methods: A scoping review systematically reviewed PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE and Web of Science. We designed search strategies to identify ICT-based patient education for autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases focused on rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus, published between January 2011 and October 2023. Data extraction was independently screened by two reviewers according to the eligibility criteria. Results: Of 13,861 records, 18 met the eligibility criteria. Most studies were randomized controlled trials, primarily conducted in the USA, focusing on rheumatoid arthritis. ICT-based interventions included web-based platforms, aiming to improve self-management, medication adherence, with most interventions showing significant improvements. Digital tools such as websites, chatbots were common. Five groups representing the ICT functions were identified: digital self-management tools, multimedia learning materials, personalized educational sessions, behavior change and empathy games, and interactive online communities and peer support. Most studies lacked theoretical frameworks, or guidelines for developing patient education. Conclusion: ICT-based patient education has significant potential for enhancing self-management and behavior changes in patients with autoimmune inflammatory rheumatic diseases. © 2024

AB  - Pre-trained large language models have demonstrated impressive text generation capabilities, including understanding, writing, and performing many tasks in natural language. Moreover, with time and improvements in training and text generation techniques, these models are proving efficient at generating increasingly human-like content. However, they can also be modified to generate persuasive, contextual content weaponized for malicious purposes, including disinformation and novel social engineering attacks. In this paper, we present a study on identifying human- and AI-generated content using different models. Precisely, we fine-tune different models belonging to the BERT family, an open-source version of the GPT model, ELECTRA, and XLNet, and then perform a text classification task using two different labeled datasets—the first one consisting of 25,000 sentences generated by both AI and humans and the second comprising 22,929 abstracts that are ChatGPT-generated and written by humans. Furthermore, we perform an additional phase where we submit 20 sentences generated by ChatGPT and 20 sentences randomly extracted from Wikipedia to our fine-tuned models to verify the efficiency and robustness of the latter. In order to understand the prediction of the models, we performed an explainability phase using two sentences: one generated by the AI and one written by a human. We leveraged the integrated gradients and token importance techniques, analyzing the words and subwords of the two sentences. As a result of the first experiment, we achieved an average accuracy of 99%, precision of 98%, recall of 99%, and F1-score of 99%. For the second experiment, we reached an average accuracy of 51%, precision of 50%, recall of 52%, and F1-score of 51%. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Various digital therapeutic products have been validated and approved since 2017. They have demonstrated efficacy and safety as a new therapeutic modality in various disorders or conditions. Hypertension is a common but serious condition that can be prevented or controlled with lifestyle changes and medicines. Although a digital therapeutic in hypertension is validated and approved in Japan, whether digital therapeutics (DTx) can significantly improve sustainable lifestyle changes is still a controversial topic. Most studies did not discuss the long-term gain challenges. In this review, the authors discuss the definition of DTx, and analyze the motivation, engagement and adherence challenges of DTx in hypertension. Some ongoing artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled or cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based digital interventions and behavioral strategies for implementing sustainable lifestyle changes are identified and analyzed. With AI-enabled interventions and behavioral strategies, DTx might be one of the effective approaches to make sustainable lifestyle changes. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Scams are fraudulent activities aiming to deceive individuals into relinquishing money, property, or rights, and they have proliferated in the context of widespread misinformation and disinformation. In this paper, we propose strategies and a research plan to address key questions about the exploitation of new communication technologies by scammers, the prevalence and nature of different scam types, and the language characteristics and appeals used in scamming content. We aim to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of scams and identify factors that contribute to their persuasiveness. Additionally, we propose the use of advanced technologies, including artificial intelligence, physiological measures, and brain mapping, to detect, investigate, and combat scams. The findings will inform the creation of educational resources and interventions, including databases, short videos, an online repository for crowdsourcing scam cases, community training programs, and online courses aimed at improving scam detection and prevention. By leveraging interdisciplinary expertise, this study seeks to develop a multi-faceted approach to mitigate the impact of scams and foster a more informed and resilient public. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Virtual influencers in various forms are capturing a growing share of ad spend from human influencers. Followers respond to virtual influencers much as if they were human, with engagement rates and measures of trust and source credibility that rival their human counterparts. However, there is an acute need for more nuanced understanding of the differential characteristics of user engagement with human influencers and the many emerging forms, types and interactional characteristics of virtual influencers. We conduct an exploratory study of three parts. First, through an indepth review of the existing literature, we delineate the implications of unsettled taxonomies of virtual influencers by function and form, and we outline a revised typology. Second, our secondary review of virtual influencer literature, trade, and industry sources conceptualizes divergent factors influencing the persuasive capability of human and virtual influencers while identifying intersecting research themes. From this synthesis we induce suggestions for future research and practice. Finally, we assess, refine and adjust our framework through depth interviews with leading expert practitioners to generate six key findings to guide future researched-backed virtual influencer practice and research. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Digital banking adoption in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) faces unique cultural and technological challenges, such as limited digital literacy, infrastructure deficits, and socioeconomic disparities. This paper introduces the Technological Influence on Digital Banking Adoption (TIDiBanD) Framework, a novel approach to contextualizing how backend technologies, data assurance practices, and frontend innovations interact with cultural barriers in digital banking adoption. The framework provides researchers with a structured method to examine the influence of technologies such as social robots, intelligent virtual assistants (IVAs), and generative AI tools in fostering digital banking acceptance. To demonstrate the utility of TIDiBanD, we conducted an empirical study evaluating the persuasiveness of social robots and IVAs in promoting digital banking services in a SIDS population. Results indicate that while IVAs were perceived as more competent and easier to interact with than social robots, social robots evoked stronger positive emotions. The study also finds that consumers in that state may prefer familiar technologies over novel ones for financial interactions, highlighting the need for culturally aligned digital banking strategies. These findings provide actionable insights for banks and policymakers aiming to enhance digital financial inclusion through persuasive technologies. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to investigate how chatbots’ warmth and competence affect customer behavioural expectation (i.e. purchase, recommendation) through perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness. Moreover, prior knowledge of chatbot is considered the boundary condition of the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence. Design/methodology/approach: A lab-in-field experiment with 213 participants and a scenario-based experiment of 186 participants were used to test the model using partial least squares structural equation modelling via SmartPLS 4. Findings: Chatbot warmth positively affects customer behavioural expectation through perceived humanness while chatbot competence positively affects customer behavioural expectation through perceived persuasiveness. Prior knowledge of chatbot positively moderates the effect of chatbot warmth on perceived humanness. Research limitations/implications: This study provides nuanced insights into the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence on customer behavioural expectation. Future studies could extend the model by exploring additional boundary conditions of the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence in different generations. Practical implications: This study offers insightful suggestions for marketing managers on how to impress and convert online customers through designing verbal scripts in customer−chatbot conversations that encourage the customers to anthropomorphise the chatbots. Originality/value: This study probes into the effects of chatbots’ warmth and competence on customer behavioural expectation by proposing and examining a novel research model that incorporates perceived humanness and perceived persuasiveness as the explanatory mechanisms and prior knowledge of chatbot as the boundary condition. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Affective responses are one of the primary and clearer signals used by agents for communicating their internal state. These internal states can represent a positive or negative acceptance of a robotic agent's behavior during a humanrobot interaction (HRI). In these scenarios, it is fundamental for robots to be able to interpret people's emotional responses and to adjust their behaviors accordingly, to appease them, and to provoke an emotional change in them. This research investigates the impact of robot facial expressions on human emotional experiences within HRI, focusing specifically on whether a robot's expressions can amplify or mitigate users' emotional responses when viewing emotion-eliciting videos. To evaluate participants' emotional states, an AI-based multimodal emotion recognition approach was employed, combining analysis of facial expressions and physiological signals, complemented by a self-assessment questionnaire. Findings indicate that participants responded more positively when the robot's facial expressions aligned with the emotional tone of the videos, suggesting that emotioncoherent displays could enhance user experience and strengthen engagement. These results underscore the potential for expressive social robots to influence human emotions effectively, offering promising applications in therapy, education, and entertainment. By incorporating emotional facial expressions, socially assistive robots could foster behavior change and emotional engagement in HRI, broadening their role in supporting human emotional well-being.  © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Background: AI-generated content is easy to access. Members of the public use it as an alternative or to supplement official sources, such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). However, the quality and reliability of AI-generated health information is questionable. This study aims to understand how AI-generated health information differs from that provided by the CDC, particularly in terms of sentiment, readability, and overall quality. Language expectancy theory serves as a framework and offers insights into how people’s expectations of message content from different sources can influence perceived credibility and persuasiveness of such information. Methods: Computer-aided text analysis was used to analyze 20 text entries from the CDC and 20 entries generated by ChatGPT 3.5. Content analysis utilizing human coders was used to assess the quality of information. Results: ChatGPT used more negative sentiments, particularly words associated with anger, sadness, and disgust. The CDC's health messages were significantly easier to read than those generated by ChatGPT. Furthermore, ChatGPT’s responses required a higher reading grade level. In terms of quality, the CDC's information was a little higher quality than that of ChatGPT, with significant differences in DISCERN scores. Conclusion: Public health professionals need to educate the general public about the complexity and quality of AI-generated health information. Health literacy programs should address topics about quality and readability of AI-generated content. Other recommendations for using AI-generated health information are provided. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly relied upon by clinicians for making diagnostic and treatment decisions, playing an important role in imaging, diagnosis, risk analysis, lifestyle monitoring, and health information management. While research has identified biases in healthcare AI systems and proposed technical solutions to address these, we argue that effective solutions require human engagement. Furthermore, there is a lack of research on how to motivate the adoption of these solutions and promote investment in designing AI systems that align with values such as transparency and fairness from the outset. Drawing on insights from psychological theories, we assert the need to understand the values that underlie decisions made by individuals involved in creating and deploying AI systems. We describe how this understanding can be leveraged to increase engagement with de-biasing and fairness-enhancing practices within the AI healthcare industry, ultimately leading to sustained behavioral change via autonomy-supportive communication strategies rooted in motivational and social psychology theories. In developing these pathways to engagement, we consider the norms and needs that govern the AI healthcare domain, and we evaluate incentives for maintaining the status quo against economic, legal, and social incentives for behavior change in line with transparency and fairness values. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are 12-fold more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (T2D) 4–6 years after delivery than women without GDM. Similarly, GDM is associated with the development of common mental disorders (CMDs) (e.g. anxiety and depression). Evidence shows that holistic lifestyle interventions focusing on physical activity (PA), dietary intake, sleep, and mental well-being strategies can prevent T2D and CMDs. This study aims to assess the effectiveness of a holistic lifestyle mobile health intervention (mHealth) with post-GDM women in preventing T2D and CMDs in a community setting in Singapore. Methods: The study consists of a 1-year randomised controlled trial (RCT) with a 3-year follow-up period. Post-GDM women with no current diabetes diagnosis and not planning to become pregnant will be eligible for the study. In addition, participants will complete mental well-being questionnaires (e.g. depression, anxiety, sleep) and their child’s socio-emotional and cognitive development. The participants will be randomised to either Group 1 (Intervention) or Group 2 (comparison). The intervention group will receive the “LVL UP App”, a smartphone-based, conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention focused on three pillars: Move More (PA), Eat Well (Diet), and Stress Less (mental wellbeing). The intervention consists of health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily “Life Hacks” (healthy activity suggestions), slow-paced breathing exercises, a step tracker (including brisk steps), a low-burden food diary, and a journaling tool. Women from both groups will be provided with an Oura ring for tracking physical activity, sleep, and heart rate variability (a proxy for stress), and the “HAPPY App”, a mHealth app which provides health promotion information about PA, diet, sleep, and mental wellbeing, as well as display body mass index, blood pressure, and results from the oral glucose tolerance tests. Short-term aggregate effects will be assessed at 26/27 weeks (midpoint) and a 1-year visit, followed by a 2, 3, and 4-year follow-up period. Discussion: High rates of progression of T2D and CMDs in women with post-GDM suggest an urgent need to promote a healthy lifestyle, including diet, PA, sleep, and mental well-being. Preventive interventions through a holistic, healthy lifestyle may be the solution, considering the inextricable relationship between physical and psychological health. We expect that holistic lifestyle mHealth may effectively support behavioural changes among women with a history of GDM to prevent T2D and CMDs.

AB  - In this study, we present a novel framework for detecting anomalies in everyday activities within a smart-home environment. Our method utilizes the growing neural gas (GNG) concept to dynamically adapt to the changing behaviors of monitored individuals, eliminating the need for supervised input. To develop and evaluate our framework, we collected real-life data from environmental sensors that tracked the daily activities of 17 elderly subjects over a continuous two-year period. The proposed approach is highly versatile, capable of detecting a wide range of anomalies associated with daily living activities. We focus on activities that exhibit abnormal duration, frequency, or entirely new behaviors that deviate from established routines. The performance evaluation of our framework revolves around two key aspects: reliability and adaptability. Reliability measures the accuracy of detecting unusual events, while adaptability assesses the system's ability to accommodate changes in user behavior. This involves recognizing recurrent anomalous behaviors as new norms over time and transitioning from persistent anomalies during an initial phase. Our proposed anomaly detection system demonstrates promising results in real-life scenarios. It achieves good reliability, with true negative rate and true positive rate exceeding 90% and 80% respectively, across all activities and users. Additionally, the system swiftly adapts to new individuals or their evolving behaviors, adjusting within a span of 3 to 7 days for new behaviors.  © 2024 - IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Implementation strategies are strategies to improve uptake of evidence-based practices or interventions and are essential to implementation science. Developing or tailoring implementation strategies may benefit from integrating approaches from other disciplines; yet current guidance on how to effectively incorporate methods from other disciplines to develop and refine innovative implementation strategies is limited. We describe an approach that combines community-engaged methods, human-centered design (HCD) methods, and causal pathway diagramming (CPD)—an implementation science tool to map an implementation strategy as it is intended to work—to develop innovative implementation strategies. Methods: We use a case example of developing a conversational agent or chatbot to address racial inequities in breast cancer screening via mammography. With an interdisciplinary team including community members and operational leaders, we conducted a rapid evidence review and elicited qualitative data through interviews and focus groups using HCD methods to identify and prioritize key determinants (facilitators and barriers) of the evidence-based intervention (breast cancer screening) and the implementation strategy (chatbot). We developed a CPD using key determinants and proposed strategy mechanisms and proximal outcomes based in conceptual frameworks. Results: We identified key determinants for breast cancer screening and for the chatbot implementation strategy. Mistrust was a key barrier to both completing breast cancer screening and using the chatbot. We focused design for the initial chatbot interaction to engender trust and developed a CPD to guide chatbot development. We used the persuasive health message framework and conceptual frameworks about trust from marketing and artificial intelligence disciplines. We developed a CPD for the initial interaction with the chatbot with engagement as a mechanism to use and trust as a proximal outcome leading to further engagement with the chatbot. Conclusions: The use of interdisciplinary methods is core to implementation science. HCD is a particularly synergistic discipline with multiple existing applications of HCD to implementation research. We present an extension of this work and an example of the potential value in an integrated community-engaged approach of HCD and implementation science researchers and methods to combine strengths of both disciplines and develop human-centered implementation strategies rooted in causal perspective and healthcare equity. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the utility of artificial intelligence (AI) in improving the persuasive communication skills of online Master of Business Administration (MBA) students. In particular, this study investigated the influence of personalization through AI using the Google Gemini platform on conventional and online instructional approaches. This quasi-experimental study used a pretest and posttest design to compare two groups of MBA students pursuing persuasive online communication. The experimental group (n = 32) interacted with the AI-based personalized learning materials, whereas the control group (n = 32) used standard instructor-designed online modules. During the 12-week intervention period, the experimental group was provided with customized practice activities. Conversely, the control group was offered conventional online learning material. The effectiveness of both approaches was evaluated using pretests and posttests. The results of Tukey’s Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test provided insight into the areas where AI-based personalized learning had a statistically significant impact. These results support the conclusions derived from an analysis of variance and further validate the study’s research hypotheses. This study demonstrates the advantages of incorporating AI into language development for remote learners and offers valuable insights for integrating AI-driven technologies into distance education. © 2025, Athabasca University.

AB  - Given the global impact of mental disorders and the increasing prevalence of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) as one of the main causes of disability, it is imperative to invest in solutions for self-management of mental health. Thus, the evolution of Digital Mental Health reveals a significant impact, with major investment in technologies that drive the development of projects that aim to innovate the benefits and results of this area. As part of the development of the RM4Health project, this work evaluated the role of web, desktop and/or mobile applications in the self-management of mental health, highlighting existing strengths and gaps. The study covered 205 applications for the management of mental health, detailing the panorama of current Behavioral Management practices, Persuasive Systems Design (PSD), Behavioral Economics (BE) principles and Security and Privacy strategies. The results obtained in this survey allow the definition of recommendations for the development of more effective, engaging, accessible and safe solutions, to promote autonomy in the management of the mental health condition. A high diversity of resources was observed, however areas of underutilization were identified, especially in BE approaches. It is recommended to combine Artificial Intelligence, Smart Coach and Gamification strategies with robust security and privacy measures. Furthermore, the development of comprehensive and intuitive solutions that prioritize key behavioral management functionalities, PSD resources and BE principles that involve the user in their own health management, regardless of whether they have been diagnosed with a mental disorder, were suggested. This study could guide future research and development in order to improve the quality of the user experience and drive advances in the field of Digital Mental Health. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - Young adults may feel embarrassed when disclosing sensitive information to their parents, while parents might similarly avoid sharing sensitive aspects of their lives with their children. How to design interactive interventions that are sensitive to the needs of both younger and older family members in mediating sensitive information remains an open question. In this paper, we explore the integration of large language models (LLMs) with social robots. Specifically, we use GPT-4 to adapt different Robot Communication Styles (RCS) for a social robot mediator designed to elicit self-disclosure and mediate health information between parents and young adults living apart. We design and compare four literature-informed RCS: three LLM-adapted (Humorous, Self-deprecating, and Persuasive) and one manually created (Human-scripted), and assess participant perceptions of Likeability, Usefulness, Helpfulness, Relatedness, and Interpersonal Closeness. Through an online experiment with 183 participants, we assess the RCS across two groups: adults with children (Parents) and young adults without children (Young Adults). Our results indicate that both Parents and Young Adults favoured the Human-scripted and Self-deprecating RCS as compared to the other two RCS. The Self-deprecating RCS furthermore led to increased relatedness as compared to the Humorous RCS. Our qualitative findings reveal challenges people have in disclosing health information to family members, and who normally assumes the role of family facilitator-two areas in which social robots can play a key role. The findings offer insights for integrating LLMs with social robots in health-mediation and other contexts involving the sharing of sensitive information.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Objective: ChatGPT and other large language models have the potential to transform the health information landscape online. However, lack of domain-specific expertise and known errors in large language models raise concerns about the widespread adoption of content generated by these tools for parents making healthcare decisions for their children. The aim of this study is to determine if health-related text generated by ChatGPT under the supervision of an expert is comparable to that generated by an expert regarding persuasiveness and credibility from the perspective of a parent. Methods: In a cross-sectional study 116 parents aged 18-65 years (M = 45.02, SD = 10.92) were asked to complete a baseline assessment of their behavioral intentions regarding pediatric healthcare topics. Subsequently, participants were asked to rate text generated by either an expert or by ChatGPT under supervision of an expert. Results: Results indicate that prompt engineered ChatGPT is capable of impacting behavioral intentions for medication, sleep, and diet decision-making. Additionally, there was little distinction between prompt engineered ChatGPT and content experts on perceived morality, trustworthiness, expertise, accuracy, and reliance. Notably, when differences were present, prompt engineered ChatGPT was rated as higher in trustworthiness and accuracy, and participants indicated they would be more likely to rely on the information presented by prompt engineered ChatGPT compared to the expert. Discussion: Given that parents will trust and rely on information generated by ChatGPT, it is critically important that human domain-specific expertise be applied to healthcare information that will ultimately be presented to consumers (e.g., parents). © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - The topic of persuasion in online conversations has social, political and security implications; as a consequence, the problem of predicting persuasive comments in online discussions is receiving increasing attention in the literature. Following recent advancements in graph neural networks, we analyze the impact of conversation structure in predicting persuasive comments in online discussions. We evaluate the performance of artificial intelligence models receiving as input graphs constructed on the top of online conversations sourced from the “Change My View” Reddit channel. We experiment with different graph architectures and compare the performance on graph neural networks, as structure-based models, and dense neural networks as baseline models. Experiments are conducted on two tasks: (1) persuasive comment detection, aiming to predict which comments are persuasive, and (2) influence prediction, aiming to predict which users are persuasive. The experimental results show that the role of the conversation structure in predicting persuasiveness is strongly dependent on its graph representation given as input to the graph neural network. In particular, a graph structure linking only comments belonging to the same speaker in the conversation achieves the best performance in both tasks. This structure outperforms both the baseline model, which does not consider any structural information, and structures linking different speakers’ comments with each other. Specifically, the F1 score of the best performing model is 0.58, which represents an improvement of 5.45% over the baseline model (F1 score of 0.55) and 7.41% over the model linking different speakers’ comments (F1 score of 0.54). © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Successful clinical development of new therapeutic interventions is notoriously difficult, especially in neurodegenerative diseases, where predictive biomarkers are scarce and functional improvement is often based on patient’s perception, captured by structured interviews. As a consequence, mechanistic modeling of the processes relevant to therapeutic interventions in CNS disorders has been lagging behind other disease indications, probably because of the perceived complexity of the brain. However in this report, we develop the argument that a combination of Computational Neurosciences and Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling of molecular pathways is a powerful simulation tool to enhance the probability of successful drug development for neurodegenerative diseases. Computational Neurosciences aims to predict action potential dynamics and neuronal circuit activation that are ultimately linked to behavioral changes and clinically relevant functional outcomes. These processes can not only be affected by the disease state, but also by common genotype variants on neurotransmitter-related proteins and the psycho-active medications often prescribed in these patient populations. Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling of molecular pathways allows to simulate key pathological drivers of dementia, such as protein aggregation and neuroinflammatory responses. They often impact neurotransmitter homeostasis and voltage-gated ion-channels or lead to mitochondrial dysfunction, ultimately leading to changes in action potential dynamics and clinical readouts. Combining these two modeling approaches can lead to better actionable understanding of the many non-linear pharmacodynamic processes active in the human diseased brain. Practical applications include a rational selection of the optimal doses in combination therapies, identification of subjects more likely to respond to treatment, a more balanced stratification of treatment arms in terms of comedications, disease status and common genotype variants and re-analysis of small clinical trials to uncover a possible clinical signal. Ultimately this will lead to a higher success rate of bringing new therapeutics to the right patient populations. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Background: The escalating prevalence of obesity worldwide increases the risk of chronic diseases and diminishes life expectancy, with a growing economic burden necessitating urgent intervention. The existing tiered approach to weight management, particularly specialist tier 3 services, falls short of meeting the population’s needs. The emergence of digital health tools, while promising, remains underexplored in specialized National Health Service weight management services (WMSs). Objective: This service evaluation study assessed the use, effectiveness, and clinical impact of the W8Buddy digital support tool as part of the National Health Service WMS. Methods: W8Buddy, a personalized digital platform, provides a tailored weight management plan to empower individuals and was collaboratively developed with input from patients, the clinical team, and DDM Health. It launched at the University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire tier 3 WMS in 2022. All patients accessing University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire WMS were offered W8Buddy as part of standard care. Data were analyzed using independent samples t tests and Fisher exact tests for continuous and categorical outcomes, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis explored associations between participant weight, engagement with W8Buddy, and time in the service. Results: Complete datasets for weights were available for 421 patients (220 W8Buddy group and 192 nonuser control group). W8Buddy users, predominantly female (n=185, 84.1%) and Caucasian, had a mean age of 43 years, while nonusers averaged 46 years (P=.02). Starting weights were comparable: 134 kg in the W8Buddy group and 130.2 kg in controls (P=.14); however, W8Buddy users had slightly higher starting BMI (49.6 vs 46.8 kg/m2, P=.08). A total of 33.5% (n=392) of patients activated W8Buddy and engaged with it. There was significant weight loss among W8Buddy users, with a 0.74 kg monthly loss compared to standard care (β=–.74, 95% CI –1.28 to –0.21; P=.007). The longer an individual stayed in this study and used W8Buddy, the more weight was lost. W8Buddy users with type 2 diabetes mellitus experienced a significant hemoglobin A1c reduction (59.8 to 51.2 mmol/mol, P=.02) compared to nonusers with type 2 diabetes. W8Buddy users also showed significant improvement across the Satisfaction With Life Scale, the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, and quality of life visual analog scale (P<.001) during follow-up. Conclusions: Participants engaging with W8Buddy as part of a digitally enabled tier 3 WMS demonstrated significant improvements in clinical and psychological outcomes, with weight changes statistically significant compared to those not engaging with the digital tool. Reduction in hemoglobin A1c was present in both groups; however, statistical significance was only reached among those engaging with W8Buddy. These findings suggest digital tools can augment traditional services and promote patient empowerment. Future studies must provide long-term data to understand if the benefits from the digital tool are sustained. ©Petra Hanson, Farah Abdelhameed, Mohammed Sahir, Nick Parsons, Arjun Panesar, Michaela de la Fosse, Charlotte Summers, Amit Kaura, Harpal Randeva, Vinod Menon, Thomas M Barber.

AB  - In the digital economy, the privacy of users′ data is becoming an essential element of business success. For example, Amazon, Spotify, Tencent, and other enterprises adopt artificial intelligence technology to combine user privacy data with business practices′ upstream and downstream context to control consumers′ choices. However, under the double pressure of privacy public events and laws, it is becoming increasingly difficult for companies to collect private information from users. To obtain user information, enterprises commonly set up an information authorization interface when users enter the platform. In particular, many platforms adopt a privacy choice option mode. That is, when providing sets of options to users, they intentionally set authorization options such as “allow” and “agree” as their defaults to guide users to disclose their privacy disclosure intentions. This study focuses on the impact of the presentation of authorization options on users′ willingness to disclose privacy. Based on the theory of persuasion knowledge, the authors explore how and why the privacy choice options (default choice: with vs. none) affect users′ intention to disclose privacy. Through 5 experiments, the results showed that compared with the display mode without default choice options, the display mode with default choice options led to lower privacy disclosure intention because users feel that the default behaviour of the platform has a commercial purpose through their persuasion knowledge and thus have the feeling of being manipulated and then have psychological resistance to the default choice behaviour of the platform. The study calls this the anti-default effect of privacy choice. Furthermore, the researchers found that cognitive load moderated the impact of the presentation of choice options on privacy disclosure intentions. Specifically, when users are under low cognitive load, the anti-default effect of privacy choice still exists. This effect is weakened when the user is under a high cognitive load. This paper has three theoretical contributions. First, it reveals the negative impact of default choice on privacy disclosure from a new perspective of privacy choice options. In past studies, scholars mainly focused on the impact of the interpretation of privacy authorization content on users′ privacy disclosure intention. For example, previous studies examined the context of whether the platform provides a privacy explanation and the sensitivity of authorization information. However, these studies ignored the possible impact of authorization options, another key element of the authorization interface. To address this problem, this paper focuses on the impact of privacy choice options on users′ willingness to disclose privacy and proves that default choice will reduce users′ willingness to disclose privacy. Second, this paper explores the mechanism of the presentation of authorization options on the intention to disclose privacy, which is helpful in promoting the literature on anti-default effects. First, default options are often used in economic decision-making and public policy areas and often show default effects. This study extends it to the field of privacy decisions and discusses the possible influence of the presentation method of default choice in the field of privacy. Second, the mechanisms of the default and anti-default effects are still different. The research states that users will have different perceptions of default options under different situations based on their inner persuasion knowledge. If users have negative perceptions, the anti-default effect is more likely to occur. The default effect is more likely to occur if the user has a positive perception. Finally, previous studies have put forwards corresponding views on how default options affect individual perception, such as perceived meaning changes, attention limitations, and processing limitations. Based on the theory of persuasion knowledge, the research proposes that the default option will make users perceive that they are being manipulated, thus generating psychological resistance to the platform and affecting users′ willingness to disclose their private information. This finding on the mechanism also corresponds to some scholars′ views on the anti-default effect of charitable donations. Finally, this paper explores the boundary conditions of cognitive load on users′ willingness to disclose privacy, which echoes the topic of user cognition in the context of current information overload. Cognitive load has been widely considered in consumer behaviour research, such as consumer choice and sponsorship. However, no research has paid attention to privacy disclosure. In this study, it is proposed that when cognitive load is low, the impact of stimulus information on users′ willingness to disclose privacy will not be affected. When the cognitive load is high, the influence of stimulus information on users′ willingness to disclose privacy will be weakened.

AB  - Automated influence is one of the most pervasive applications of artificial intelligence in our day-to-day lives, yet a thoroughgoing account of its associated individual and societal harms is lacking. By far the most widespread, compelling, and intuitive account of the harms associated with automated influence follows what I call the control argument. This argument suggests that users are persuaded, manipulated, and influenced by automated influence in a way that they have little or no control over. Based on evidence about the effectiveness of targeted advertising as well as empirical results about the nature of attentional control, I provide reasons to reject this argument. In turn, I use C. Thi Nguyen’s theory of value collapse to develop a new account of the harmfulness of automated influence. ©2024 by the Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois.

AB  - Distraction osteogenesis is widely used for bone tissue engineering. Mechanical stimulation plays a central role in the massive tissue regeneration observed during distraction osteogenesis. Although distraction osteogenesis has been a boon for patients with bone defects, we still have limited knowledge about the intrinsic mechanotransduction that converts physical forces into biochemical signals capable of inducing cell behavior changes and new tissue formation. In this review, we summarize the findings for mechanoresponsive factors, including cells, genes, and signaling pathways, during the distraction osteogenesis different phases. These elements function for coupling of osteogenesis and angiogenesis via the Integrin-FAK, TGF-β/BMP, Wnt/β-catenin, Hippo, MAPK, PI3K/Akt, and HIF-1α signaling pathways in a mechanoresponsive niche. The available evidence further suggests the existence of a balance between the epithelial–mesenchymal transition and mesenchymal–epithelial transition under hypoxic stress. We also briefly summarize the current in silico simulation algorithms and propose several future research directions that may advance understanding of distraction osteogenesis in the era of bioinformation, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence models with reliable single-cell RNA sequencing datasets. The objective of this review is to utilize established knowledge to further optimize existing distraction protocols and to identify potential therapeutic targets. © 2024 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology.

AB  - Background: Prediabetes is a highly prevalent condition that heralds an increased risk of progression to type 2 diabetes, along with associated microvascular and macrovascular complications. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) is an established effective intervention for diabetes prevention. However, participation in this 12-month lifestyle change program has historically been low. Digital DPPs have emerged as a scalable alternative, accessible asynchronously and recognized by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Yet, most digital programs still incorporate human coaching, potentially limiting scalability. Furthermore, existing effectiveness results of digital DPPs are primarily derived from per protocol, longitudinal non-randomized studies, or comparisons to control groups that do not represent the standard of care DPP. The potential of an AI-powered DPP as an alternative to the DPP is yet to be investigated. We propose a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to directly compare these two approaches. Methods: This open-label, multicenter, non-inferiority RCT will compare the effectiveness of a fully automated AI-powered digital DPP (ai-DPP) with a standard of care human coach-based DPP (h-DPP). A total of 368 participants with elevated body mass index (BMI) and prediabetes will be randomized equally to the ai-DPP (smartphone app and Bluetooth-enabled body weight scale) or h-DPP (referral to a CDC recognized DPP). The primary endpoint, assessed at 12 months, is the achievement of the CDC’s benchmark for type 2 diabetes risk reduction, defined as any of the following: at least 5% weight loss, at least 4% weight loss and at least 150 min per week on average of physical activity, or at least a 0.2-point reduction in hemoglobin A1C. Physical activity will be objectively measured using serial actigraphy at baseline and at 1-month intervals throughout the trial. Secondary endpoints, evaluated at 6 and 12 months, will include changes in A1C, weight, physical activity measures, program engagement, and cost-effectiveness. Participants include adults aged 18–75 years with laboratory confirmed prediabetes, a BMI of ≥ 25 kg/m2 (≥ 23 kg/m2 for Asians), English proficiency, and smartphone users. This U.S. study is conducted at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, MD, and Reading Hospital (Tower Health) in Reading, PA. Discussion: Prediabetes is a significant public health issue, necessitating scalable interventions for the millions affected. Our pragmatic clinical trial is unique in directly comparing a fully automated AI-powered approach without direct human coach interaction. If proven effective, it could be a scalable, cost-effective strategy. This trial will offer vital insights into both AI and human coach-based behavioral change strategies in real-world clinical settings. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05056376.

AB  - This paper discusses the study of concrete composite walls of algorithmic modeling, in which steel tubes are embedded. The load-bearing capacity of STHC composite walls increases with the increase of axial load coefficient, but its ductility decreases. The load-bearing capacity can be improved by increasing the strength of the steel pipes; however, the elasticity of STHC composite walls was found to be slightly reduced. As the shear stress coefficient increases, the load-bearing capacity of STHC composite walls decreases significantly, while the deformation resistance increases. By analyzing actual cases, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the research results in real situations and enhance the persuasiveness of the conclusions. The research results can provide a basis for future research, inspire more explorations on seismic design and construction, and further advance the development of this field. Emphasize the importance of research results, promote interdisciplinary cooperation in the fields of structural engineering, earthquake engineering, and materials science, and improve overall seismic resistance. The emphasis on these aspects will help highlight the practical impact of the research results, further strengthen the conclusions, and promote progress in the design and construction of earthquake-resistant structures. The goals of this work are access to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services, promotion of inclusive and sustainable urbanization and participation, implementation of sustainable and disaster-resilient architecture, sustainable planning and management of human settlements. Simulation results of linear and nonlinear structures show that this method can detect structural parameters and their changes due to damage and unknown disturbances. Therefore, it is believed that with the further development of fuzzy neural network artificial intelligence theory, this goal will be achieved in the near future.  © 2024 Techno-Press, Ltd.

AB  - Pharmacogenomic (PGx) biomarkers integrated using machine learning can be embedded within the electronic health record (EHR) to provide clinicians with individualized predictions of drug treatment outcomes. Currently, however, drug alerts in the EHR are largely generic (not patient-specific) and contribute to increased clinician stress and burnout. Improving the usability of PGx alerts is an urgent need. Therefore, this work aimed to identify principles for optimal PGx alert design through a health-system-wide, mixed-methods study. Clinicians representing multiple practices and care settings (N = 1062) in urban, rural, and underserved regions were invited to complete an electronic survey comparing the usability of three drug alerts for citalopram, as a case study. Alert 1 contained a generic warning of pharmacogenomic effects on citalopram metabolism. Alerts 2 and 3 provided patient-specific predictions of citalopram efficacy with varying depth of information. Primary outcomes included the System's Usability Scale score (0–100 points) of each alert, the perceived impact of each alert on stress and decision-making, and clinicians' suggestions for alert improvement. Secondary outcomes included the assessment of alert preference by clinician age, practice type, and geographic setting. Qualitative information was captured to provide context to quantitative information. The final cohort comprised 305 geographically and clinically diverse clinicians. A simplified, individualized alert (Alert 2) was perceived as beneficial for decision-making and stress compared with a more detailed version (Alert 3) and the generic alert (Alert 1) regardless of age, practice type, or geographic setting. Findings emphasize the need for clinician-guided design of PGx alerts in the era of digital medicine. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background The ability to access and navigate online sexual health information and support is increasingly needed in order to engage with wider sexual healthcare. However, people from underserved populations may struggle to pass though this “digital doorway”. Therefore, using a behavioural science approach, we first aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to i) seeking online sexual health information and ii) seeking online sexual health support. Subsequently, we aimed to generate theory-informed recommendations to improve these access points. Methods The PROGRESSPlus framework guided purposive recruitment (15.10.21–18.03.22) of 35 UK participants from diverse backgrounds, including 51% from the most deprived areas and 26% from minoritised ethnic groups. Using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis, we identified barriers and facilitators to seeking online sexual health information and support. A Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) analysis then identified recommendations to better meet the needs of underserved populations. Results We found diverse barriers and facilitators. Barriers included low awareness of and familiarity with online information and support; perceptions that online information and support were unlikely to meet the needs of underserved populations; overwhelming volume of information sources; lack of personal relevancy; chatbots/automated responses; and response wait times. Facilitators included clarity about credibility and quality; inclusive content; and in-person assistance. Recommendations included: Education and Persuasion e.g., online and offline promotion and endorsement by healthcare professionals and peers; Training and Modelling e.g., accessible training to enhance searching skills and credibility appraisal; and Environmental Restructuring and Enablement e.g., modifications to ensure online information and support are simple and easy to use, including video/audio options for content. Conclusions Given that access to many sexual health services is now digital, our analyses produced recommendations pivotal to increasing access to wider sexual healthcare among underserved populations. Implementing these recommendations could reduce inequalities associated with accessing and using online sexual health service. © 2025 McLeod et al.

AB  - With the exponential growth of livestream shopping and the development of artificial intelligence (AI), virtual influencers powered by AI have become a new trend. However, this phenomenon has yet to be studied precisely to understand the underlying mechanisms of virtual AI streamers’ influence on the viewers. This study explores the effects of virtual influencers powered by AI by investigating the persuasive factors and underlying emotional mechanism that affect viewers’ parasocial interaction intention and impulse buying intention. Data collected from 559 livestream viewers in a scenario-based survey were analyzed using maximum likelihood structural equation modeling (SEM) estimation and cross-validated using Bayesian SEM. The findings confirm the appraisal–emotion–action scheme and validate the role of arousal in mediating three persuasive factors and two behavioral approaches. Parasocial interaction intention was correlated with coolness, whereas congruence and mind perception were important antecedents of viewers’ urge to buy impulsively. Furthermore, mindset had important moderating effects on arousal and parasocial interaction intention toward impulsive urges. This study extends the research on influencer marketing and livestream shopping. It also apprises marketing and retailing managers of the importance of nurturing an AI workforce and sheds light on IS management practice for potential industry opportunities. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Generative Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) is already beginning to alter legal practice. If optimistic forecasts prove warranted, how might this technology transform judicial opinions—a genre often viewed as central to the law? This Symposium Essay attempts to answer that predictive question, which sheds light on present realities. In brief, the provision of opinions will become cheaper and, relatedly, more widely and evenly supplied. Judicial writings will often be zestier, more diverse, and less deliberative. And as the legal system’s economy of persuasive ability is disrupted, courts will engage in a sort of arms race with the public: judges will use artificially enhanced rhetoric to promote their own legitimacy, and the public will become more cynical to avoid being fooled. Paradoxically, a surfeit of persuasive rhetoric could render legal reasoning itself obsolete. In response to these developments, some courts may disallow AI writing tools so that they can continue to claim the authority that flows from authorship. Potential stakes thus include both the fate of legal reason and the future of human participation in the legal system. © 2024 George Washington University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Artificially intelligent physical activity digital assistants that use the full spectrum of machine learning capabilities have not yet been developed and examined. This study aimed to explore potential users' perceptions and expectations of using such a digital assistant. Six 90-min online focus group meetings (n = 45 adults) were conducted. Meetings were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Participants embraced the idea of a ‘digital assistant’ providing physical activity support. Participants indicated they would like to receive notifications from the digital assistant, but did not agree on the number, timing, tone and content of notifications. Likewise, they indicated that the digital assistant's personality and appearance should be customisable. Participants understood the need to provide information to the digital assistant to allow for personalisation, but varied greatly in the extent of information that they were willing to provide. Privacy issues aside, participants embraced the idea of using artificial intelligence or machine learning in return for a more functional and personal digital assistant. In sum, participants were ready for an artificially intelligent physical activity digital assistant but emphasised a need to personalise or customise nearly every feature of the application. This poses challenges in terms of cost and complexity of developing the application. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Tuberculomas are prevalent in developing countries and demonstrate variable signals on MRI resulting in the overlap of the conventional imaging phenotype with other entities including glioma and brain metastasis. An accurate MRI diagnosis is important for the early institution of anti-tubercular therapy, decreased patient morbidity, mortality, and prevents unnecessary neurosurgical excision. This study aims to assess the potential of radiomics features of regular contrast images including T1W, T2W, T2W FLAIR, T1W post contrast images, and ADC maps, to differentiate between tuberculomas, high-grade-gliomas and metastasis, the commonest intra parenchymal mass lesions encountered in the clinical practice. Methods: This retrospective study includes 185 subjects. Images were resampled, co-registered, skull-stripped, and zscore-normalized. Automated lesion segmentation was performed followed by radiomics feature extraction, train-test split, and features reduction. All machine learning algorithms that natively support multiclass classification were trained and assessed on features extracted from individual modalities as well as combined modalities. Model explainability of the best performing model was calculated using the summary plot obtained by SHAP values. Results: Extra tree classifier trained on the features from ADC maps was the best classifier for the discrimination of tuberculoma from high-grade-glioma and metastasis with AUC-score of 0.96, accuracy-score of 0.923, Brier-score of 0.23. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that radiomics features are effective in discriminating between tuberculoma, metastasis, and high-grade-glioma with notable accuracy and AUC scores. Features extracted from the ADC maps surfaced as the most robust predictors of the target variable. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: There has been a surge in the development of apps that aim to improve health, physical activity (PA), and well-being through behavior change. These apps often focus on creating a long-term and sustainable impact on the user. Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that are based on passive sensing of the user’s current context (eg, via smartphones and wearables) have been devised to enhance the effectiveness of these apps and foster PA. JITAIs aim to provide personalized support and interventions such as encouraging messages in a context-aware manner. However, the limited range of passive sensing capabilities often make it challenging to determine the timing and context for delivering well-accepted and effective interventions. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) can provide personal context by directly capturing user assessments (eg, moods and emotions). Thus, EMA might be a useful complement to passive sensing in determining when JITAIs are triggered. However, extensive EMA schedules need to be scrutinized, as they can increase user burden. Objective: The aim of the study was to use machine learning to balance the feature set size of EMA questions with the prediction accuracy regarding of enacting PA. Methods: A total of 43 healthy participants (aged 19‐67 years) completed 4 EMA surveys daily over 3 weeks. These surveys prospectively assessed various states, including both motivational and volitional variables related to PA preparation (eg, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and perceived barriers) alongside stress and mood or emotions. PA enactment was assessed retrospectively via EMA and served as the outcome variable. Results: The best-performing machine learning models predicted PA engagement with a mean area under the curve score of 0.87 (SD 0.02) in 5-fold cross-validation and 0.87 on the test set. Particularly strong predictors included self-efficacy, stress, planning, and perceived barriers, indicating that a small set of EMA predictors can yield accurate PA prediction for these participants. Conclusions: A small set of EMA-based features like self-efficacy, stress, planning, and perceived barriers can be enough to predict PA reasonably well and can thus be used to meaningfully tailor JITAIs such as sending well-timed and context-aware support messages. © Devender Kumar, David Haag, Jens Blechert, Josef Niebauer, Jan David Smeddinck.

AB  - Algorithmic persuasion is a mode of organizing that happens through inducing experiences that covertly seek to influence behavior by presenting an ongoing stream of affective recommendations. This essay advances the thesis that this mode of algorithmic organizing has the capacity to affect individuals’ sense of their self and explores how and why this may happen. It suggests that individuals may be susceptible to experiencing AI recommendation systems as sublime. Their sublime qualities give normative force to their recommendations and, through them, appeal to one’s affective drives, fears, and hopes, revealing who or what one is or may become. This subjecting of one’s self to these recommendations warrants two critical observations: a behavioral preference we call “people-like-you” and the emergence of “algorithm conformity” as an organizing force. Yet, there can be epistemic corruption in the recommendations. This epistemic corruption is the else, whose experience can evoke uncanny feelings and carries with it the possibility to break the spell of the sublime and to escape and resist algorithm conformity. But can such experiences, individual and dispersed, give rise to actions of collective resistance in a world of algorithmic capitalism? © The Author(s) 2025.

AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) that deliver proactive interventions can benefit users by reducing their cognitive workload and improving performance. However, little is known regarding how such interventions would impact users' reflection on choices in voice-only decision-making tasks. We conducted a within-subjects experiment to evaluate the effect of CA's feedback delivery strategy at three levels (no feedback, unsolicited and solicited feedback) and the impact on users' likelihood of changing their choices in an interactive food ordering scenario. We discovered that in both feedback conditions the CA was perceived to be significantly more persuasive than in the baseline condition, while being perceived as significantly less confident. Interestingly, while unsolicited feedback was perceived as less appropriate than the baseline, both types of proactive feedback led participants to relisten and reconsider menu options significantly more often. Our results provide insights regarding the impact of proactive feedback on CA perception and user's reflection in decision-making tasks, thereby paving a new way for designing proactive CAs.  © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to fully understand the relationship between students' classroom emotions and teachers' behaviors in the teaching environment, provide personalized teaching support, stimulate teachers' motivation, and enhance the emotional connection between teachers and students. This paper designs a teacher's ability model based on emotion-behavior relevance theory and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Methods: Firstly, this paper expounds on the integration of emotion-behavior relevance theory, AI, and teacher's ability model under the background of ideological and political education. Subsequently, the artificial neural network (ANN) model is deeply analyzed in relation to the development of psychology and AI technology. Guided by the theory of emotion-behavior relevance, an ANN model is used to optimize the classroom emotion recognition module in the teacher's ability model. The accuracy of the optimized teacher's ability model in recognizing attention and resistance is verified by experiments. The relationship between the teacher's classroom emotions, students' classroom behavior, and the teacher's teaching ability is analyzed. Results: The experimental results show that the optimized model can effectively identify students' classroom emotions, and the accuracy of identifying attention and resistance reaches 93.6 % and 92 %, respectively, significantly exceeding the traditional model. For other emotions, the accuracy of the experimental group ranges from 80.6 % to 87.9 %, while that of the control group is only 61.1 %. The optimized model shows a better effect on the emotional recognition of multiple students. This proves the effectiveness of the proposed optimization model. In addition, by analyzing teachers' emotions in real classroom videos, people can observe that teachers' psychological emotions and behaviors change with the changes in students' classroom emotions. Under the students' positive emotions, teachers scored high in psychological emotions, behaviors, and teaching achievements, with the lowest scores of 87, 80, and 85, respectively. Under students' negative emotions, teachers' related scores are low, with the highest scores of 40, 40, and 42. This highlights the critical influence of the emotional attitude and values of the main characters on teachers' teaching ability in the classroom environment from the psychological perspective. Conclusion: Students' positive emotions, such as concentration and devotion, will arouse teachers' satisfaction and happiness, motivate them to teach more diligently, and improve the teaching effect. On the contrary, students' negative emotions, such as resistance and doubt, may cause teachers to feel depressed and discouraged. This proves the importance and effectiveness of integrating the emotion-behavior relevance theory into teaching. Students' emotions impact teachers' psychological emotions and behaviors and affect the teaching effect. In this case, teachers need to use their emotional adjustment ability to adjust their feelings in time to better guide students and improve teaching efficiency. This paper provides valuable insights for optimizing the teacher's ability model. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technology in e-commerce has currently stimulated scholarly attention, however studies on AI and e-commerce generally relatively few. The current study aims to evaluate how artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots persuade users to consider chatbot recommendations in a web-based buying situation. Employing the theory of elaboration likelihood, the current study presents an analytical framework for identifying factors and internal mechanisms of consumers' readiness to adopt AI chatbot recommendations. The authors evaluated the model employing questionnaire responses from 411 Chinese AI chatbot consumers. The findings of present study indicated that chatbot recommendation reliability and accuracy is positively related to AI technology trust and have negative effect on perceived self-threat. In addition, AI technology trust is positively related to intention to adopt chatbot decision whereas perceived self-threat negatively related to intention to adopt chatbot decision. The perceived dialogue strengthens the significant relationship between AI-tech trust and intention to adopt chatbot decision and weakens the negative relationship between perceived self-threat and intention to adopt AI chatbot decisions. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Objectives: Large language models (LLMs) are poised to change care delivery, but their impact on health equity is unclear. While marginalized populations have been historically excluded from early technology developments, LLMs present an opportunity to change our approach to developing, evaluating, and implementing new technologies. In this perspective, we describe the role of LLMs in supporting health equity. Materials and Methods: We apply the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) research framework to explore the use of LLMs for health equity. Results: We present opportunities for how LLMs can improve health equity across individual, family and organizational, community, and population health. We describe emerging concerns including biased data, limited technology diffusion, and privacy. Finally, we highlight recommendations focused on prompt engineering, retrieval augmentation, digital inclusion, transparency, and bias mitigation. Conclusion: The potential of LLMs to support health equity depends on making health equity a focus from the start.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: An estimated 93% of adults in the United States access the internet, with up to 80% looking for health information. However, only 12% of US adults are proficient enough in health literacy to interpret health information and make informed health care decisions meaningfully. With the vast amount of health information available in multimedia formats on social media platforms such as YouTube and Facebook, there is an urgent need and a unique opportunity to design an automated approach to curate online health information using multiple criteria to meet the health literacy needs of a diverse population. Objective: This study aimed to develop an automated approach to assessing the understandability of patient educational videos according to the Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool (PEMAT) guidelines and evaluating the impact of video understandability on viewer engagement. We also offer insights for content creators and health care organizations on how to improve engagement with these educational videos on user-generated content platforms. Methods: We developed a human-in-the-loop, augmented intelligence approach that explicitly focused on the human-algorithm interaction, combining PEMAT-based patient education constructs mapped to features extracted from the videos, annotations of the videos by domain experts, and cotraining methods from machine learning to assess the understandability of videos on diabetes and classify them. We further examined the impact of understandability on several dimensions of viewer engagement with the videos. Results: We collected 9873 YouTube videos on diabetes using search keywords extracted from a patient-oriented forum and reviewed by a medical expert. Our machine learning methods achieved a weighted precision of 0.84, a weighted recall of 0.79, and an F1-score of 0.81 in classifying video understandability and could effectively identify patient educational videos that medical experts would like to recommend for patients. Videos rated as highly understandable had an average higher view count (average treatment effect [ATE]=2.55; P<.001), like count (ATE=2.95; P<.001), and comment count (ATE=3.10; P<.001) than less understandable videos. In addition, in a user study, 4 medical experts recommended 72% (144/200) of the top 10 videos ranked by understandability compared to 40% (80/200) of the top 10 videos ranked by YouTube’s default algorithm for 20 ramdomly selected search keywords. Conclusions: We developed a human-in-the-loop, scalable algorithm to assess the understandability of health information on YouTube. Our method optimally combines expert input with algorithmic support, enhancing engagement and aiding medical experts in recommending educational content. This solution also guides health care organizations in creating effective patient education materials for underserved health topics. ©Xiao Liu, Anjana Susarla, Rema Padman.

AB  - Purpose: Amid rising concerns over unhealthy dietary habits and their impact on public health, this study aims to explore the role of avatars in promoting healthier eating and enhancing customer satisfaction in restaurants. By leveraging the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and nudge theory, this research sought to gain insights into consumer behavior and assess how digital innovations can encourage healthier food choices. Design/methodology/approach: This study recruited 672 participants in the USA. Participants viewed a video featuring an avatar that informed them about available healthy food options, simulating a restaurant ordering scenario. Following the video, participants completed comprehensive online surveys. The collected data was analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling to assess the effectiveness and implications of the intervention. Findings: The findings revealed that health consciousness, environmental awareness, social norms and perceived behavioral control significantly influence dietary habits. Restaurant health initiatives and avatar persuasiveness were found to encourage healthier food choices, improve customer satisfaction and loyalty and enhance electronic word-of-mouth. The study confirmed that avatars equipped with attributes such as competence, warmth, trustworthiness and credibility can be an effective digital nudge for consumers toward healthier dietary decisions. Originality/value: This study’s originality lies in its integration of TPB and nudge theory, bridging the gap between individual psychological factors and external cues. This comprehensive framework provides valuable insights for restaurant managers, artificial intelligence developers and policymakers, offering practical strategies to promote healthier eating and enhance customer experiences through digital innovation. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI)-driven marketing has transformed the landscape of consumer interactions, but it also raises ethical concerns regarding perceived manipulation and subsequent unethical young consumer behavior. This study aims to investigate the direct and indirect effects of AI-driven marketing on unethical young consumer behavior, with digital literacy as a moderating variable. The authors introduce and conceptualize a digital literacy construct that influences how young consumers perceive and react to manipulative AI-driven marketing tactics. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and the Persuasion Knowledge Model (PKM), this research explores how digital literacy influences the reception of AI-driven marketing and moderates the effects of perceived manipulative tactics. This study adopts a three-wave, time-lagged survey method among young consumers in urban Pakistan, integrating measures of AI-driven marketing techniques, perceived manipulation, digital literacy and unethical consumer behavior. Findings: The results reveal that perceived manipulation mediates the relationship between AI-driven marketing and unethical young consumer behavior. Digital literacy significantly moderates this effect, indicating that higher digital literacy levels can mitigate the negative impacts of perceived manipulation. Conversely, lower digital literacy amplifies the negative impacts of perceived manipulation. Practical implications: The findings underscore the need for marketers to foster transparency and ethical practices in AI-driven strategies. Enhancing consumer digital literacy can serve as a protective factor against unethical marketing practices. Originality/value: This study contributes to the understanding of digital literacy’s protective role against unethical AI-driven marketing practices. It extends existing models of persuasion and consumer response by demonstrating how digital literacy reshapes traditional consumer response frameworks in the context of AI-driven environments. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: Lifestyle modification programs play a critical role in preventing and managing cardiovascular disease (CVD). A key aim of many programs is improving patients’ self-efficacy. In-person lifestyle modification programs can enhance self-efficacy in managing CVD risk, also known as cardiac self-efficacy (CSE). However, such programs are typically staffing and resource intensive. Digital lifestyle modification programs may offer a scalable and accessible way to improve CSE, but this has not been shown in prior research. Objective: This study examined changes in CSE among individuals using a digital lifestyle modification program for cardiovascular health. Evaluation of improvement in CSE was a secondary goal of a feasibility and acceptability pilot study of a digital program for Heart Health. Methods: Participants were individuals with elevated risk for CVD who enrolled in a 90-day pilot study that involved mobile app–based, artificial intelligence–powered health coaching and educational lessons focused on behaviors that promote cardiovascular health. Participants completed the 9-item CSE Scale at baseline and in month 2. Changes in confidence in participants’ ability to manage their cardiovascular health were assessed. Results: The sample included 273 (n=207, 61.2% female; mean age 59.3, SD 10.1 years) participants who submitted a complete CSE Scale at baseline and in month 2. The total CSE Scale score increased by 12.9% (P<.001) from baseline to month 2. Additionally, there were significant increases in mean score on each of the 9 individual CSE Scale items (all P<.001), with the largest increases in confidence “in knowing when to call or visit the doctor for your heart disease” (17% increase; P<.001), “in knowing how much physical activity is good for you” (16.3% increase; P<.001), and “that you can get regular aerobic exercise” (19% increase; P<.001). Conclusions: The present analyses indicate that participants in a digital lifestyle modification program for cardiovascular health showed significant improvements in CSE within 2 months. This work adds to the growing literature examining ways to improve health-related self-efficacy and scalable access to programs for prevention and management of CVD. © Kimberly G Lockwood, Priya R Kulkarni, OraLee H Branch, Sarah A Graham.

AB  - The primary goal of Recommender Systems is to suggest the most suitable items to a user, aligning them with the user’s interests and needs. RSs are essential for modern e-commerce, helping users discover content and products by predicting suitable items based on their past behavior. However, their success isn’t just about advanced algorithms. The design of the user interface and a good integration with the human decision-making process are equally crucial. A well-designed interface enhances the user experience and makes recommendations more effective, while a poor interface can lead to frustration. Recognizing this limitation, recent trends in Recommender Systems (RSs) are increasingly focusing on integrating Symbiotic Human-Machine Decision-Making models. These models aim to offer users a dynamic and persuasive interface that helps them better understand and engage with recommendations. This shift is a crucial step toward developing recommender systems that truly connect with users and offer a more enjoyable, trustworthy, explainable, and user-friendly experience. Although early efforts concentrated on creating systems that could proactively predict user preferences and needs, modern RSs also emphasize the importance of providing users with control and transparency over their recommendations. Finding the right balance between proactivity and user control is essential to ensure that the system supports users without being too intrusive, thus improving their overall satisfaction. As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more integrated into recommender systems, the importance of user-centric interfaces and a deep understanding of decision-making becomes even more critical. Effective integration of LLMs requires interfaces that are both visually and cognitively engaging. These aspects are the main discussion topics of the Joint Workshop on Interfaces and Human Decision Making for Recommender Systems at RecSys’24. In this summary, we introduce the motivation and perspective of the workshop, review its history, and discuss the most critical issues that deserve attention for future research directions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Background: Diabetes self-management education and support (DSMES) improves diabetes outcomes yet remains consistently underutilized. Chatbot technology offers the potential to increase access to and engagement in DSMES. Evidence supporting the case for chatbot uptake and efficacy in people with diabetes (PWD) is needed. Method: A diabetes education and support chatbot was deployed in a regional health care system. Adults with type 2 diabetes with an A1C of 8.0% to 8.9% and/or having recently completed a 12-week diabetes care management program were enrolled in a pilot program. Weekly chats included three elements: knowledge assessment, limited self-reporting of blood glucose data and medication taking behaviors, and education content (short videos and printable materials). A clinician facing dashboard identified need for escalation via flags based on participant responses. Data were collected to assess satisfaction, engagement, and preliminary glycemic outcomes. Results: Over 16 months, 150 PWD (majority above 50 years of age, female, and African American) were enrolled. The unenrollment rate was 5%. Most escalation flags (N = 128) were for hypoglycemia (41%), hyperglycemia (32%), and medication issues (11%). Overall satisfaction was high for chat content, length, and frequency, and 87% reported increased self-care confidence. Enrollees completing more than one chat had a mean drop in A1C of −1.04%, whereas those completing one chat or less had a mean increase in A1C of +0.09% (P =.008). Conclusion: This diabetes education chatbot pilot demonstrated PWD acceptability, satisfaction, and engagement plus preliminary evidence of self-care confidence and A1C improvement. Further efforts are needed to validate these promising early findings. © 2023 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Formative verbal feedback during live surgery is essential for adjusting trainee behavior and accelerating skill acquisition. Despite its importance, understanding optimal feedback is challenging due to the difficulty of capturing and categorizing feedback at scale. We propose a Human-AI Collaborative Refinement Process that uses unsupervised machine learning (Topic Modeling) with human refinement to discover feedback categories from surgical transcripts. Our discovered categories are rated highly for clinical clarity and are relevant to practice, including topics like “Handling and Positioning of (tissue)” and “(Tissue) Layer Depth Assessment and Correction [during tissue dissection].” These AI-generated topics significantly enhance predictions of trainee behavioral change, providing insights beyond traditional manual categorization. For example, feedback on “Handling Bleeding” is linked to improved behavioral change. This work demonstrates the potential of AI to analyze surgical feedback at scale, informing better training guidelines and paving the way for automated feedback and cueing systems in surgery. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) imitates the human brain’s capacity for problem-solving and making decisions by using computers and other devices. People engage with artificial intelligence-enabled products like virtual agents, social bots, and language-generation software, to name a few. The paradigms of communication theory, which have historically put a significant focus on human-to-human communication, do not easily match these gadgets. AI in multidimensional touch is the subject of this review article, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the most recent research published in the field of AI, specifically related to communication. Additionally, we considered several theories and models (communication theory, AI-based persuasion theory, social exchange theory, Frames of mind, Neural network model, L-LDA model, and Routine model) to explain a complex phenomenon and to create a conceptual framework that is appropriate for this goal and a voluntary relationship between two or more people that lasts for an extended period. Communication and media studies focus on human–machine communication (HMC), a rapidly developing research area. It is our intention to continue investigating the beneficial and detrimental effects of artificial intelligence on human communication as well as to identify novel concepts, theories, and challenges as the research process develops. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - We introduce a novel application of large language models (LLMs) in developing a virtual counselor capable of conducting motivational interviewing (MI) for alcohol use counseling. Access to effective counseling remains limited, particularly for substance abuse, and virtual agents offer a promising solution by leveraging LLM capabilities to simulate nuanced communication techniques inherent in MI. Our approach combines prompt engineering and integration into a user-friendly virtual platform to facilitate realistic, empathetic interactions. We evaluate the effectiveness of our virtual agent through a series of studies focusing on replicating MI techniques and human counselor dialog. Initial findings suggest that our LLM-powered virtual agent matches human counselors’ empathetic and adaptive conversational skills, presenting a significant step forward in virtual health counseling and providing insights into the design and implementation of LLM-based therapeutic interactions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Maps have served as authoritative and trustworthy sources of geospatial information for years. However, maps are increasingly being wielded to spread misinformation due to the democratization of mapmaking, advances in AI, and the emergence of post-truth politics. Trust plays a fundamental role in the spread of misinformation, but our understanding of trust in the context of maps is limited. In this paper, I examine the methodologies employed by empirical studies on trust in maps and synthesize the major findings of said studies. Most of the reviewed studies were experiments that utilized single-item self-reporting Likert-type measures to capture trust. I organized the findings of the studies into six major themes including source, metadata, transparency, uncertainty, design, and information modality. Additionally, I present a research agenda based on the findings and limitations of existing works. This agenda highlights methodological challenges to studying trust in maps and proposes opportunities in the form of research questions. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: A healthy lifestyle may improve mental health. It is yet not known whether and how a mobile intervention can be of help in achieving this in adolescents. This study investigated the effectiveness and perceived underlying mechanisms of the mobile health (mHealth) intervention #LIFEGOALS to promote healthy lifestyles and mental health. #LIFEGOALS is an evidence-based app with activity tracker, including self-regulation techniques, gamification elements, a support chatbot, and health narrative videos. Methods: A quasi-randomized controlled trial (N = 279) with 12-week intervention period and process evaluation interviews (n = 13) took place during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adolescents (12-15y) from the general population were allocated at school-level to the intervention (n = 184) or to a no-intervention group (n = 95). Health-related quality of life (HRQoL), psychological well-being, mood, self-perception, peer support, resilience, depressed feelings, sleep quality and breakfast frequency were assessed via a web-based survey; physical activity, sedentary time, and sleep routine via Axivity accelerometers. Multilevel generalized linear models were fitted to investigate intervention effects and moderation by pandemic-related measures. Interviews were coded using thematic analysis. Results: Non-usage attrition was high: 18% of the participants in the intervention group never used the app. An additional 30% stopped usage by the second week. Beneficial intervention effects were found for physical activity (χ 21 = 4.36, P =.04), sedentary behavior (χ 21 = 6.44, P =.01), sleep quality (χ 21 = 6.11, P =.01), and mood (χ 21 = 2.30, P =.02). However, effects on activity-related behavior were only present for adolescents having normal sports access, and effects on mood only for adolescents with full in-school education. HRQoL (χ 22 = 14.72, P <.001), mood (χ 21 = 6.03, P =.01), and peer support (χ 21 = 13.69, P <.001) worsened in adolescents with pandemic-induced remote-education. Interviewees reported that the reward system, self-regulation guidance, and increased health awareness had contributed to their behavior change. They also pointed to the importance of social factors, quality of technology and autonomy for mHealth effectiveness. Conclusions: #LIFEGOALS showed mixed results on health behaviors and mental health. The findings highlight the role of contextual factors for mHealth promotion in adolescence, and provide suggestions to optimize support by a chatbot and narrative episodes.

AB  - Objective: Recent advances in large language models (LLM) offer opportunities to automate health coaching. With zero-shot learning ability, LLMs could revolutionize health coaching by providing better accessibility, scalability, and customization. The aim of this study is to compare the quality of responses to clients' sleep-related questions provided by health coaches and an LLM. Design, setting, and participants: From a de-identified dataset of coaching conversations from a pilot randomized controlled trial, we extracted 100 question-answer pairs comprising client questions and corresponding health coach responses. These questions were entered into a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)-enabled open-source LLM (LLaMa-2-7b-chat) to generate LLM responses. Out of 100 question-answer pairs, 90 were taken out and assigned to three groups of evaluators: experts, lay-users, and GPT-4. Each group conducted two evaluation tasks: (Task 1) a single-response quality assessment spanning five criteria—accuracy, readability, helpfulness, empathy, and likelihood of harm—rated on a five-point Likert scale, and (Task 2) a pairwise comparison to choose the superior response between pairs. A suite of inferential statistical methods, including the paired and independent sample t-tests, Pearson correlation, and chi-square tests, were utilized to answer the study objective. Recognizing potential biases in human judgment, the remaining 10 question-answer pairs were used to assess inter-evaluator reliability among the human evaluators, quantified using the interclass correlation coefficient and percentage agreement metrics. Results: Upon exclusion of incomplete data, the analysis included 178 single-response evaluations (Task 1) and 83 pairwise comparisons (Task 2). Expert and GPT-4 assessments revealed no discernible disparities in health coach and LLM responses across the five metrics. Contrarily, lay-users deemed LLM responses significantly more helpful than that of human coaches (p < 0.05). LLM responses were preferred in the majority (62.25 %, n = 155) of the aggregate 249 assessments, with all three evaluator groups favoring LLM over health coach inputs. While GPT-4 rated both health coach and LLM responses significantly higher than experts in terms of readability, helpfulness, and empathy, its ratings on accuracy and likelihood of harm aligned with those of experts. Response length positively correlated with accuracy and empathy scores, but negatively affected readability across all evaluator groups. Expert and lay-user evaluators demonstrated moderate to high inter-evaluator reliability. Conclusion: Our study showed encouraging findings by demonstrating that RAG-enabled LLM has comparable performance to health coaches in the domain tested. Serving as an initial step towards the creation of more sophisticated, adaptive, round-the-clock automated health coaching systems, our findings call for more extensive evaluation which could assist in the development of the model that could in the future lead to potential clinical implementation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Misinformation is a major threat to individual, organizational and societal well-being. Combating it requires change on multiple levels. The purpose of this paper is to describe two co-created initiatives designed to holistically reduce the prevalence and effects of misinformation on social media. Design/methodology/approach: The authors adopted a co-creation approach by convening a stakeholder group including social media, advertising, artificial intelligence and advocacy leaders. The authors also engaged social media users to collectively generate, test and implement an anti-misinformation strategy. These stakeholders shaped the development of the tools described in this paper. Findings: First, the authors present a Social Media Ecosystem Map and Incentive Analysis that achieve impact by documenting avenues for action. Second, the authors illustrate impact at the user level by developing and disseminating the WISER framework, which delivers an implementable and memorable anti-misinformation strategy. Research limitations/implications: Strategies tailored to the needs and characteristics of stakeholders are most likely to be persuasive. The discoveries and conclusions incorporate the contexts of the stakeholders with whom the authors collaborated. Future work will reveal recommendations for a broader audience. Practical implications: The Social Media Ecosystem Map, Incentive Analysis and WISER framework represent promising foundations to spark novel insights and actions for ways to be WISER about information on social media. Originality/value: Impact is often limited because strategies are developed in academic, corporate or policy silos. The authors adopt an original approach by exchanging knowledge among industry, academia and users with the aim of maximizing effectiveness and adoption. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - A natural way to resolve different points of view and form opinions is through exchanging arguments and knowledge. Facing the vast amount of available information on the internet, people tend to focus on information consistent with their beliefs. To support a fair and unbiased opinion-building process, we propose an intelligent agent in the form of a chatbot that engages in a deliberative dialogue with a human. In contrast to persuasive systems, the chatbot aims to provide a diverse and representative overview - embedded in a conversation with the user. To account for a reflective and unbiased exploration of the topic, we enable the system to intervene if the user is too focused on their pre-existing opinion. To achieve that, the agent employs a metric to assess the user’s focus on challenger arguments. We report on a user study with 45 participants showing that the intervention significantly affects the user’s focus on challenger arguments. We further report significant main effects of intervention on the user’s attention to crucial areas of the system, and report on multiple interaction effects of user characteristics. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Matching the language or content of a message to the psychological profile of its recipient (known as “personalized persuasion”) is widely considered to be one of the most effective messaging strategies. We demonstrate that the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, could accelerate this influence by making personalized persuasion scalable. Across four studies (consisting of seven sub-studies; total N = 1788), we show that personalized messages crafted by ChatGPT exhibit significantly more influence than non-personalized messages. This was true across different domains of persuasion (e.g., marketing of consumer products, political appeals for climate action), psychological profiles (e.g., personality traits, political ideology, moral foundations), and when only providing the LLM with a single, short prompt naming or describing the targeted psychological dimension. Thus, our findings are among the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to automate, and thereby scale, the use of personalized persuasion in ways that enhance its effectiveness and efficiency. We discuss the implications for researchers, practitioners, and the general public. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Drawing on propositions from the HAII-TIME (Human–artificial intelligence [AI] Interaction and the Theory of Interactive Media Effects) and Persuasion Knowledge Model, this study examines how knowledge of automated journalism (AJ) moderates the evaluation of algorithmically generated news. Experiment 1 demonstrates the utility of process-related knowledge in user evaluations of agency: individuals with little knowledge of AJ prefer attributions of human authorship over news stories attributed to algorithms, whereas individuals with high AJ knowledge have an equal or stronger preference for news that is described as algorithmically generated. Experiment 2 conditions these effects to show how prior characterizations of AJ—whether more machine- or human-like—shape evaluations of algorithmically generated news contingent on user age and knowledge level. Effects are found for differing age groups at lower levels of AJ knowledge, where machine-like characterizations enhance evaluations of algorithmically generated news for younger users but ascribing human-like traits enhances evaluations of automated news for older users. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The rise of generative AI has brought with it a surprising paradox: systems that excel at tasks once thought to be uniquely human, like fluent conversation or persuasive writing, while simultaneously failing to meet traditional expectations of computing, in terms of reliability, accuracy, and veracity (e.g., given the various issues with so-called ‘hallucinations’). We argue that, when generative AI is seen through a traditional computing lens, its development focuses on optimizing for traditional computing traits that remain in principle unattainable. This risks backgrounding what is most novel and defining about it. As probabilistic technologies, generative AIs do not store, in any traditional sense, any data or content. Rather, essential features of training data become encoded in deep neural networks as patterns, that become practically available as styles. We discuss what happens when the distinction between objects and their appearance dissolves and all aspects of images or text become understood as styles, accessible for exploration and creative combination and generation. For example, defining visual qualities of entities like ‘chair’ or ‘cat’ become available as ‘chair-ness’ or ‘cat-ness’ for creative image generation. We argue that, when understood as style engines, unique generative AI capabilities become conceptualized as complementing traditional computing ones. This will aid both computing practitioners and information systems researchers in reconciling and integrating generative AI into the traditional IS landscape. Our conceptualization leads us to propose four archetypes of generative AI application and use, and to highlight future avenues for information systems research made visible by this conceptualization, as well as implications for practice and policymaking. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Personalized video marketing is increasingly leveraged as advertisers employ artificial intelligence and machine learning to tailor content to target audiences. Grounded in self-reference theory and the Elaboration Likelihood Model, this study examines the impact of video personalization on consumer engagement. Partnering with Vidyard, a video hosting platform, we analyzed historical video data to assess how personalized content influences persuasion pathways. Using a mixed-methods approach, we identified significant differences in engagement and elaboration between personalized and non-personalized videos. Findings indicate that personalized videos yield higher message downloads, rewatch likelihood, and click-through rates, aligning with central processing. Additionally, open-ended surveys from firms using personalized video identified three key benefits: increased engagement, heightened viewer attention, and competitive differentiation. The study concludes with a comparative analysis of results and discusses both theoretical and managerial implications. © 2025 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Theory of mind (ToM) reasoning involves understanding that others have intentions, emotions, and thoughts, which is crucial for regulating one's reasoning. Although large language models (LLMs) excel in tasks such as summarization, question answering, and translation, they still face challenges with ToM reasoning, especially in open-ended questions. Despite advancements, the extent to which LLMs truly understand ToM reasoning and how closely it aligns with human ToM reasoning remains inadequately explored in open-ended scenarios. Motivated by this gap, we assess the abilities of LLMs to perceive and integrate human intentions and emotions into their ToM reasoning processes within open-ended questions. Our study utilizes posts from Reddit's ChangeMyView platform, which demands nuanced social reasoning to craft persuasive responses. Our analysis, comparing semantic similarity and lexical overlap metrics between responses generated by humans and LLMs, reveals clear disparities in ToM reasoning capabilities in open-ended questions, with even the most advanced models showing notable limitations. To enhance LLM capabilities, we implement a prompt tuning method that incorporates human intentions and emotions, resulting in improvements in ToM reasoning performance. However, despite these improvements, the enhancement still falls short of fully achieving human-like reasoning. This research highlights the deficiencies in LLMs' social reasoning and demonstrates how integrating human intentions and emotions can boost their effectiveness.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Objective: Few individuals with eating disorders (EDs) receive treatment. Innovations are needed to identify individuals with EDs and address care barriers. We developed a chatbot for promoting services uptake that could be paired with online screening. However, it is not yet known which components drive effects. This study estimated individual and combined contributions of four chatbot components on mental health services use (primary), chatbot helpfulness, and attitudes toward changing eating/shape/weight concerns (“change attitudes,” with higher scores indicating greater importance/readiness). Methods: Two hundred five individuals screening with an ED but not in treatment were randomized in an optimization randomized controlled trial to receive up to four chatbot components: psychoeducation, motivational interviewing, personalized service recommendations, and repeated administration (follow-up check-ins/reminders). Assessments were at baseline and 2, 6, and 14 weeks. Results: Participants who received repeated administration were more likely to report mental health services use, with no significant effects of other components on services use. Repeated administration slowed the decline in change attitudes participants experienced over time. Participants who received motivational interviewing found the chatbot more helpful, but this component was also associated with larger declines in change attitudes. Participants who received personalized recommendations found the chatbot more helpful, and receiving this component on its own was associated with the most favorable change attitude time trend. Psychoeducation showed no effects. Discussion: Results indicated important effects of components on outcomes; findings will be used to finalize decision making about the optimized intervention package. The chatbot shows high potential for addressing the treatment gap for EDs. © 2024 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Power dynamics through the lens of autonomy in human-robot interaction (HRI) has largely been considered through the robot's persuasion and its impact on users. Power found in hierarchies and relationships between users and robots has been less investigated. Through a co-design workshop with industry employees, we investigate how employees design autonomous agents (AA) for a risk management and safety task, focusing on the designed agent interactions and personalities (robots and chatbots). The qualitative analysis of the storyboards and personalities revealed how employees designed autonomy and power dynamics between the workers and AAs, mirroring power dynamics in social systems. These results revealed how power dynamics are interconnected with anthropomorphization of AAs, demonstrating what has been previously theorized by HRI scholars. Overall, this work considers autonomy and power in design representations and unifies varying conceptualizations of power in HRI to support a holistic perspective of how power is explored through HRI design. © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - Storytelling is a human universal. The ubiquity of stories and the rapid development in Artificial Intelligence (AI) pose important questions: can AI like ChatGPT tell engaging and persuasive stories? If so, what makes a narrative engaging and persuasive? Three pre-registered experiments comparing human-generated narratives from existing research and the ChatGPT-generated versions using descriptions and materials from these studies show that labeling AI as a narrative source led to lower transportation, higher counterarguing, and lower story-consistent beliefs. However, AI-generated narratives led to lower (Study 1 and 3) or similar levels (Study 2) of counterarguing than the human-generated version. Readers showed lower (Study 2) or similar levels of transportation (Study 1 and 3) when reading the AI- than the human-generated stories. We suggest the AI model's linguistic competence and logical coherence contribute to its stories' verisimilitude. However, AI's lack of lived experience and creativity may limit its storytelling ability.  © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This book systematically investigates the linguistic strategies employed in beauty product advertising to assess their persuasive and manipulative effects. The work is divided into two sections: a review of relevant literature and an empirical analysis of advertisements. The analysis initially focuses on the linguistic features of advertisements created by humans prior to the introduction of ChatGPT, examining the linguistic measures used and their methods of persuasion and manipulation. Subsequent sections provide a detailed examination of advertisements generated by ChatGPT versions 3.5 and 4.0, analysing the artificial intelligence's use of linguistic techniques. This includes a meta-analysis where ChatGPT itself discusses the linguistic strategies it employs. The ultimate goal is to compare and contrast the effectiveness and linguistic devices used in advertisements crafted by humans and those by ChatGPT, analysing how AI influences the language of advertising and its impact on consumer behaviour. © 2025 Ida Skubis and Dominika Kolodziejczyk.

AB  - Humans evolved to learn from one another. Today, however, learning opportunities often emerge from interactions with AI systems. Here, we argue that learning from AI systems resembles learning from other humans, but may be faster and more efficient. Such ‘hyper learning’ can occur because AI: (i) provides a high signal-to-noise ratio that facilitates learning, (ii) has greater data processing ability, enabling it to generate persuasive arguments, and (iii) is perceived (in some domains) to have superior knowledge compared to humans. As a result, humans more quickly adopt biases from AI, are often more easily persuaded by AI, and exhibit novel problem-solving strategies after interacting with AI. Greater awareness of AI's influences is needed to mitigate the potential negative outcomes of human-AI interactions. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Autoregressive language models, which use deep learning to produce human-like texts, have surged in prevalence. Despite advances in these models, concerns arise about their equity across diverse populations. While AI fairness is discussed widely, metrics to measure equity in dialogue systems are lacking. This paper presents a framework, rooted in deliberative democracy and science communication studies, to evaluate equity in human–AI communication. Using it, we conducted an algorithm auditing study to examine how GPT-3 responded to different populations who vary in sociodemographic backgrounds and viewpoints on crucial science and social issues: climate change and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. We analyzed 20,000 dialogues with 3290 participants differing in gender, race, education, and opinions. We found a substantively worse user experience among the opinion minority groups (e.g., climate deniers, racists) and the education minority groups; however, these groups changed attitudes toward supporting BLM and climate change efforts much more compared to other social groups after the chat. GPT-3 used more negative expressions when responding to the education and opinion minority groups. We discuss the social-technological implications of our findings for a conversational AI system that centralizes diversity, equity, and inclusion. © 2024, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: As artificial intelligence (AI) has become increasingly accessible, a growing number of organizations have begun to adopt AI in hiring. Despite the increasing use of AI in hiring, little is known about how organizations can effectively communicate with their stakeholders about their AI use. Using gain and loss message frames and organization–public relationships (OPRs) as theoretical frameworks, this study tests the impact of exposure to job advertisements that address AI use on individuals’ attitudes and behaviors toward organizations using AI during hiring. Design/methodology/approach: We conducted a 2 (message frames: gain vs loss) × 2 (benefits of using AI in hiring: faster hiring process vs reduced unconscious hiring bias) between-subjects experiment using a Prolific online panel (N = 224). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions and viewed a fictitious company’s job advertisement that varied in message frames and benefits of using AI. After viewing the experimental stimuli, participants answered questions about OPRs, attitudes toward the company and positive word-of-mouth (WOM) intentions. Findings: Loss-framed messages appeared as more effective in increasing OPRs, favorable attitudes toward the company and positive WOM intentions. OPRs positively mediated the impact of exposure to loss-framed job advertisements on attitudes and positive WOM intentions. The benefits of using AI in hiring moderated the impact of loss-framed messages on OPRs, attitudes and positive WOM intentions. Practical implications: This study offers important practical implications for organizations that use AI technology in their hiring practices or are interested in incorporating AI into their hiring processes. The significant impact of loss-framed messages suggests that organizations should highlight the anticipated negative outcomes of not using AI rather than addressing the positive outcomes from AI use. The findings align with established negativity bias research in framing literature, demonstrating individuals’ greater susceptibility to negative information and adverse outcomes in persuasive contexts. The moderating effect of the benefits of using AI in hiring indicates that the impact of message frames on individuals’ attitudinal and behavioral responses to organizations’ AI use varies depending on organizations’ rationale for using AI. Originality/value: This study is one of the early studies to examine individuals’ attitudinal and behavioral responses to organizations’ use of AI in hiring. Prior research suggests that OPRs mediate the relationship between individuals’ exposure to organizational messages and their attitudes toward organizations. Extending this line of inquiry, the current study explores OPRs’ mediating role in the context of AI-driven hiring processes and investigates how OPRs mediate the relationships between organizations’ message framing strategies and individuals’ attitudes toward the organization as well as their WOM intentions. By examining the effectiveness of gain- and loss-framed job advertisements, this study offers important insights for organizations on how to more effectively and ethically communicate about AI use with their stakeholders. © 2025, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Comprehensive concepts of AI literacy (AIL) and valid measures are essential for research (e.g., intervention studies) and practice (e.g., personnel selection/development) alike. To date, several scales have been published, sharing standard features but differing in some aspects. We first aim to briefly overview instruments identified from unsystematic literature research in February 2023. We identified four scales and one collection of items. We describe the instruments and compare them. We identified common themes and overlaps in the instruments and developmental procedure. We also found differences regarding scale development procedures and latent dimensions. Following this literature research, we came to the conclusion that the literature on AI literacy measurement was fragmented, and little effort was undertaken to integrate different AI literacy conceptualizations. The second focus of this study is to test the factorial structures of existing AIL measurement instruments and identify latent dimensions of AIL across all instruments. We used robust maximum-likelihood confirmatory factor analysis to test factorial structures in a joint survey of all AIL items in an English-speaking online sample (N=219). We found general support for all instruments' factorial structures with minor deviations from the original factorial structures for some of the instruments. In a second analysis step, to address the issue of fragmented research on AI literacy conceptualization and measurement, we used principal axis exploratory factor analysis with oblique rotation to identify latent dimensions across all items. We found four correlated latent dimensions of AIL, which were mostly interpretable as the abilities to use and interact with AI, to design/program AI (incl. in-depth technical knowledge), to perform complex cognitive operations regarding AI (e.g., ethical considerations), and a common factor for the abilities to detect AI/differentiate between AI and humans and manage persuasive influences of AI (i.e., persuasion literacy). Our findings sort the multitude of AIL instruments and reveal four latent core dimensions of AIL. Thus, they contribute importantly to the conceptual understanding of AIL that has been fragmented so far. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Importance: The study highlights the potential and limitations of the Large Language Models (LLMs) in recognizing different states of motivation to provide appropriate information for behavior change. Following the Transtheoretical Model (TTM), we identified the major gap of LLMs in responding to certain states of motivation through validated scenario studies, suggesting future directions of LLMs research for health promotion. Objectives: The LLMs-based generative conversational agents (GAs) have shown success in identifying user intents semantically. Little is known about its capabilities to identify motivation states and provide appropriate information to facilitate behavior change progression. Materials and Methods: We evaluated 3 GAs, ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Llama 2 in identifying motivation states following the TTM stages of change. GAs were evaluated using 25 validated scenarios with 5 health topics across 5 TTM stages. The relevance and completeness of the responses to cover the TTM processes to proceed to the next stage of change were assessed. Results: 3 GAs identified the motivation states in the preparation stage providing sufficient information to proceed to the action stage. The responses to the motivation states in the action and maintenance stages were good enough covering partial processes for individuals to initiate and maintain their changes in behavior. However, the GAs were not able to identify users' motivation states in the precontemplation and contemplation stages providing irrelevant information, covering about 20%-30% of the processes. Discussion: GAs are able to identify users' motivation states and provide relevant information when individuals have established goals and commitments to take and maintain an action. However, individuals who are hesitant or ambivalent about behavior change are unlikely to receive sufficient and relevant guidance to proceed to the next stage of change. Conclusion: The current GAs effectively identify motivation states of individuals with established goals but may lack support for those ambivalent towards behavior change. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Rhetoric, Aristotle's art of persuasion, holds contemporary relevance in diverse realms such as politics, economics, and daily communication. This paper explores the enduring influence of rhetoric, from its historical roots to its modern applications in marketing, public relations, and digital contexts. Specifically, it investigates an experimental teaching strategy within a course unit of Rhetoric and Argumentation, included in the context of an undergraduate Business Communication curriculum, emphasizing the fusion of classical rhetoric principles with the demands of the digital age. The study involves students crafting Press Releases, juxtaposed with AI-generated content from tools like ChatGPT, WriteSonic or CopyAI. Through a comparative peer and blind analysis, the research assesses factors like structure, reliability, style, and persuasion. Findings reveal distinctions between human and AI-generated content, shedding light on potential applications and challenges in integrating AI tools for teaching writing skills. This exploration contributes insights into the dynamic relationship between traditional and digital rhetoric in contemporary communication education, stressing and remind us that we should adopt a new paradigm in the way we teach and manage language in the digital age. Writing has become more mechanical because of technology. Consequently, authors are investigating and engaging in forms of writing that were formerly believed to be outside the scope of literary practice: © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.

AB  - As virtual reality (VR) technology continues to gain traction as a powerful tool for persuasion and marketing, its application in immersive sales environments has become increasingly relevant. VR's ability to simulate realistic interactions allows for novel approaches to influencing consumer behavior, particularly through the use of interactive Virtual Humans (VHs). In this study, we investigate the effects of user and virtual human age and gender on persuasion and social influence, via various social psychological factors such as brand attitude, interpersonal attraction, source credibility, and presence. In the process, we conducted a 3 (virtual agent age) × 2 (virtual agent gender) × 3 (module topic) multi-factorial design (N=45). The study included two agent gender conditions, namely gender-matched and gender-mismatched with the user, assigned in a between-subjects manner, and three agent age conditions, namely (1) young adult (20-39), (2) middle-aged adult (40-59), and (3) older adult (60-79). Our findings indicate that the age and gender of virtual humans significantly influence their persuasiveness and social impact, which varies based on the user's own age and gender. Specifically, virtual humans of a different gender from the user may exhibit higher levels of persuasion and social influence. Furthermore, female and older users appear to be more susceptible to influence compared to male and younger users. Our findings provide novel, critical insights for designing more effective virtual sales strategies and tailoring persuasive technologies to diverse user profiles, thus filling a vital gap in understanding the interaction between user and agent characteristics in virtual environments.1 © 2025 IEEE.

AB  - The Wizard of Oz (WoZ) method is a widely adopted research approach where a human Wizard “role-plays” a not readily available technology and interacts with participants to elicit user behaviors and probe the design space. With the growing ability for modern large language models (LLMs) to role-play, one can apply LLMs as Wizards in WoZ experiments with better scalability and lower cost than the traditional approach. However, methodological guidance on responsibly applying LLMs in WoZ experiments and a systematic evaluation of LLMs’ role-playing ability are lacking. Through two LLM-powered WoZ studies, we take the first step towards identifying an experiment lifecycle for researchers to safely integrate LLMs into WoZ experiments and interpret data generated from settings that involve Wizards role-played by LLMs. We also contribute a heuristic-based evaluation framework that allows the estimation of LLMs’ role-playing ability in WoZ experiments and reveals LLMs’ behavior patterns at scale. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Adolescents with long-term health conditions may benefit from digital health interventions (DHIs) to support self-management. The study aimed to map the current research on DHIs for adolescents with long-term conditions in South Africa, focusing on the types of interventions, targeted chronic conditions, and reported outcomes. The scoping review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews (PRISMA-ScR) checklist. Searches were conducted in electronic databases such as EBSCOHost (CINAHL, MEDLINE, Academic Search Ultimate, and APA PSycArticles), Wiley Online Library, and PubMed for articles published between 2014 and 2024. Studies that (1) involved adolescents with a long-term health condition (aged 15–24) residing in South Africa, (2) reported on the use of digital health technology, and (3) provided empirical evidence were included. Nine studies were included in the analysis, focusing primarily on HIV, depression/anxiety, and diabetes. Most interventions utilized WhatsApp, SMS, or social media to provide peer or healthcare worker support. Process outcomes like acceptability and feasibility dominated, with limited data on effectiveness. DHIs show potential for supporting adolescent health but cover a limited number of long-term health conditions and face barriers to effective implementation. Affordable, context-specific solutions co-designed with adolescents are crucial to enhance engagement and ensure scalability in the South African context.

AB  - In recent years, Japanese companies and municipalities have increasingly recognized the importance of urban decarbonization. Urban areas, with their concentration of businesses, must consider not only decarbonization but also the well-being of the people working there. It is particularly important for business leaders to balance decarbonization efforts with employee well-being. This project aims to create scenarios that achieve both decarbonization and well-being in Nihonbashi, a central business district in Tokyo. The main focus is on long-term forecasting and management of energy demand using integrated simulation technology with an urban digital twin and developing scenarios that contribute to improving the overall well-being of employees. Project activities include predicting and visualizing hourly energy demand for buildings within the area and assessing the effects of various decarbonization options. One decarbonization option involves implementing a system to transmit locally generated renewable energy to Nihonbashi and validating it with predictive models. By collaborating with building owners to advance energy management, the project has identified the potential to achieve approximately 10% energy savings. In addition, the project will also work to improve employee well-being by implementing a chatbot program that will educate employees about their company's decarbonization activities and encourage behavior change to increase their sense of contribution. The project aims to enhance sustainable urban development and comfort in the office area and is an important step in a larger decarbonization initiative that will be implemented in partnership with building owners in the Nihonbashi area. Ultimately, the project aims to improve energy efficiency and overall community well-being and serve as a model for future urban sustainability. © 2025, Scanditale AB. All rights reserved.

AB  - Acute exacerbations of COPD (ECOPD) are an important event in the life of a COPD patient as it causes significant deterioration of physical, mental, and social health, hastens disease progression, increases the risk of dying and causes a huge economic loss. Preventing ECOPD is therefore one of the most important goals in the management of COPD. Before the patient is discharged after hospitalization for ECOPD, it is crucial to offer an evidence-based care bundle protocol that will help minimize the future risk of readmissions and death. To develop the content of this quality care bundle, an Expert Working Group was formed, which performed a systematic review of literature, brainstormed, and debated on key clinical issues before arriving at a consensus strategy that could help physicians achieve this goal. A 7-point consensus strategy was prepared, which included: (1) enhancing awareness and seriousness of ECOPD, (2) identifying patients at risk for future exacerbations, (3) optimizing pharmacologic treatment of COPD, (4) identifying and treating comorbidities, (5) preventing bacterial and viral infections, (6) pulmonary rehabilitation, and (7) palliative care. Physicians may find this 7-point care bundle useful to minimize the risk of future exacerbations and reduce morbidity and mortality. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - If AI is the new electricity, what should we do to keep ourselves from getting electrocuted? In this work, we explore factors related to the potential of large language models (LLMs) to manipulate human decisions. We describe the results of two experiments designed to determine what characteristics of humans are associated with their susceptibility to LLM manipulation, and what characteristics of LLMs are associated with their manipulativeness potential. We explore human factors by conducting user studies in which participants answer general knowledge questions using LLM-generated hints, whereas LLM factors by provoking language models to create manipulative statements. Then, we analyze their obedience, the persuasion strategies used, and the choice of vocabulary. Based on these experiments, we discuss two actions that can protect us from LLM manipulation. In the long term, we put AI literacy at the forefront, arguing that educating society would minimize the risk of manipulation and its consequences. We also propose an ad hoc solution, a classifier that detects LLM manipulation - a Manipulation Fuse. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - The level of financial risk spread out to the world during the COVID-19 pandemic has shown that none of the countries are immune to financial uncertainty and the vast changes it brings to economic stability. The contagiousness of sovereign risk is a result of the interdependent structure of countries’ financial networks. Yet the analysis of sovereign CDS risk spread using the network view is both new and limited. With this study, we want to use the network view to prove the interconnectedness of the financial systems in Europe and its effect on the spread of the risk throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. The objective of this study is threefold: First, using the Bayesian networks learned from the daily CDS values of 17 European Union countries, we demonstrate the dependent network structure of countries and the movement of the sovereign risk over this network with a cascading behavior. Second, we explore how the probabilistic dependency structure changes over the different phases of the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to alterations on the behavior of the sovereign risk spread. The previous studies on the sovereign risk spread during the COVID-19 pandemic employs the data over the whole period of the pandemic. However, during the pandemic the behavior of the spread was changing, and to capture that change the consideration of shorter intervals becomes crucial. Therefore, in this study, the COVID-19 crisis period from December 2019 until February 2021 is divided into five phases of 3-month time intervals. As the third and last objective, this study intends to be a roadmap for policy makers as well as for researchers to understand the true nature and connectedness of sovereign risk transmissions. For that purpose, we provide a benchmark procedure for the evaluation of the sovereign risk of countries using Bayesian networks which involves a comprehensive analysis involving several steps conducted on each of the learned Bayesian networks for the different phases of the pandemic. In terms of policy implications, this study aims to be helpful for investors that want to diversify sovereign risk in their bond portfolios and be explanatory for the changing behavior of the risk spread during crisis periods. Moreover, this study exemplifies the use of artificial intelligence methods to understand the working mechanism of economic systems. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Organizational and risk cultures in the financial industry are argued to be the root cause of banking problems. It is concerning that financial regulators and practitioners still consider the industry to be seriously fragile in several respects, particularly to operational risks and risks associated with digital transformation and innovation—not that the risks of organizational misconduct have disappeared. The rescue of Credit Suisse in 2023 confirms this. This paper employs extant theories of organizational culture, learning, and action to critically evaluate the existing risk paradigm in banking and to highlight its deficiencies, which practitioners can only address by questioning the flawed assumptions and dysfunctional values and behaviors found to be endemic in banks. However, business and risk practitioners are also married to institutional approaches that focus on assessing risk and measuring historical losses to allocate regulatory capital, rather than forward-looking approaches to measure and manage risk. This requires a paradigm change. This paper presents a novel risk measurement and accounting methodology, Risk Accounting, to help underpin such change. Risk accounting measures risk exposure in quantitative and qualitative terms and can be implemented using an AI-enabled digital architecture that could solve endemic problems with risk data aggregation and analysis. Significantly, risk accounting enables a financial value to be placed on risk exposures at a granular level. This level of transparency provides an incentive to change behaviors in banks and support cultural change while providing a basis for a paradigm change in the way operational risk is managed. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - While conversational agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) can drive progress in many domains, they are prone to generating faulty information. To ensure an efficient, safe, and satisfactory user experience maximizing benefits of these systems, users must be empowered to judge the reliability of system outputs. In this, both disclaimers and agents' communicative style are pivotal design instances. In an online study with 594 participants, we investigated how these affect users' trust and a mock-up agent's persuasiveness, based on an established framework from social psychology. While prior information on potential inaccuracies or faulty information did not affect trust, an authoritative communicative style elicited more trust. Also, a trusted agent was more persuasive resulting in more positive attitudes regarding the subject of the conversation. Results imply that disclaimers on agents' limitations fail to effectively alter users' trust but can be supported by appropriate communicative style during interaction. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - To diagnose someone’s reasoning today as “sophistry” is to say that this reasoning is at once persuasive (at least to a significant degree) and logically invalid. We begin by explaining that, despite some recent scholarly arguments to the contrary, the understanding of ‘sophistry’ and ‘sophistic’ underlying such a lay diagnosis is in fact firmly in line with the hallmarks of reasoning proffered by the ancient sophists themselves. Next, we supply a rigorous but readable definition of what constitutes sophistic reasoning (=sophistry). We then discuss “artificial” sophistry: the articulation of sophistic reasoning facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and promulgated in our increasingly digital world. Next, we present, economically, a particular kind of artificial sophistry, one embodied by an artificial agent: the lying machine. Afterward, we respond to some anticipated objections. We end with a few speculative thoughts about the limits (or lack thereof) of artificial sophistry, and what may be a rather dark future. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This article showcases a speculative methodology for recreating interactions between a human and Google Search’s Auto-Predict interface as conversations, to explore how AI-based systems are both persuasive and deeply personal. Using ethnomethodology tools and a symbolic interactionist lens, the paper presents three versions of a single Google search, each variation building a slightly different angle on the plausible utterances and interpersonal dynamics of the human and nonhuman partners. This thought experiment emerges from a decade of classroom-based digital literacy exercises with young adults, training them to analyze their lived experiences with digital media, algorithms, and devices. Transforming information exchanges into personal conversations provides a creative method for analyzing how relations are co-constructed in the granular processes of interaction, through which mutual intelligibility is built, meaning about the world is made, and identities are formed. This critical analysis extends methods for human–machine communication studies and elaborates notions of algorithmic identity. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Travel behavior changes are essential to transportation decarbonization. Travel diaries, consisting of sequences of trips between places, are typically used to instrument human travel behavior. However, these diaries are only as accurate as the underlying methods used to construct them. Travel diary algorithms have been a popular research topic since the advent of Global Positioning System tracking surveys. These algorithms have typically been validated using prompted recall of presegmented trips, thus disregarding the continuity of mode inference. Phone operating systems have adopted battery-conserving techniques, but the resulting data collection errors have not been studied extensively. We introduce a framework to evaluate the accuracy of trip length computations and mode inference by analyzing continuous mode-segmented trajectories for groups of trips. We then use the framework to identify the input data quality and the impact of postprocessing. Our primary inputs to this evaluation are MobilityNet, a public dataset containing information from three artificial timelines covering 15 different travel modes, and sample open-source travel diary creation algorithms from the OpenPATH project. Our framework concretely shows that the variance of the distance error drops from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) (Android, iOS) after postprocessing. Similarly, the weighted F-scores for mode inference increase from (Formula presented.) to (Formula presented.) (iOS, Android) between random forest and geographic information system-based models. We hope that this standardized method will be adapted to evaluate other, potentially proprietary, travel diary algorithms. The results can be used to understand and improve the state of the art in the travel diary creation field. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.

AB  - Widespread digitalization affects not only technological processes, but also social norms and practices. Many decisions that significantly impact individuals and society are increasingly made based on big data analytics or delegated to artificial intelligence. In such conditions, IT specialists become new agents of power who influence society not through persuasion, but through the technologies being developed and implemented. This explains the increased interest in the beliefs and values of IT developers, as well as their ability to take moral responsibility for their professional decisions. The article presents the results of a twostage empirical study, consisting of indepth interviews (n = 8) and a targeted survey (n = 50). Analysis of these data showed that the community of IT specialists is fragmented and disunited. The need for ethical regulation of the professional activities in this group is not expressed, and ethics is perceived rather as a hindrance or an unnecessary addition to the legal means of regulating work with big data. Generally, IT leads are less interested in ethical regulation of work with big data than nonmanagerial personnel, which may be due to a commitment to the interests of companies focused on direct or indirect profit maximization. Despite the weakly expressed need for the development and implementation of a professional ethics code, big data experts made several valuable suggestions and comments regarding its structure and content and noted that it should primarily be aimed at ensuring the reliability of big data storage and the protection of personal data. © 2024 Russian Public Opinion Research Center, VCIOM.

AB  - Following the World Health Organization’s declaration that the COVID-19 pandemic is no longer a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), COVID-19 remains an ongoing threat to human health and healthcare systems. Vaccination plays a crucial role in reducing the disease’s incidence, mitigating its severity, and limiting transmission, contributing to long-term public health resilience. However, incomplete vaccination coverage and vaccine hesitancy exist. This narrative review investigates strategies at the system and physician levels aimed at sustaining awareness and uptake of COVID-19 vaccination in a post-PHEIC era. Through an examination of the existing literature, this review explores the effectiveness of diverse approaches utilized by healthcare systems and individual providers. These approaches address every component of the 5C model of vaccine hesitancy: confidence, complacency, constraints/convenience, calculation, and collective responsibility. Physician-level approaches include appropriate message framing, persuasive communication containing safety and personal/social benefit information, sharing of personal stories, creating a safe space for discussion, harnessing co-administration with annual influenza vaccines, and use of decision aids and visual messages. System-level approaches include messaging, mass media for health communication, on-site vaccine availability, pharmacist delivery, healthcare protocol integration, incentives, and chatbot use. © 2024 by the author.

AB  - This paper introduces the collection of the Journal on Machine Learning (ML) and the user. It provides a brief history of ML from the 1950’s through to the current time, sketching the nature of the kinds of precursor AI techniques used in such things as expert systems right the way through to the emergence of ML and its tool sets, including deep learning. It concludes with the ‘generative AI’ used in such ML technologies as PaLM and GPT-3. The history highlights key changes and developments in ML, the especial importance and limitations of deep learning, and the changing attitudes and expectations of users in an environment when ML can and often is oversold. The paper then explores the ways CSCW research has addressed the social context of organisational systems and how the same can apply for ML tools and techniques. It urges research that focuses on the particular ways that ML comes to fit into ‘real world’ collaborative work sites and hence speaks to the CSCW cannon. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.

AB  - The potential of LLMs to generate context-specific content for psychiatric patients could possibly be used to support treatment. Patients diagnosed with Severe Mental Illnesses face a significant challenge in the realm of goal setting. Caregivers work closely with patients with SMI to establish treatment goals. However, most goals are often immeasurable, hindering their integration into mHealth. This is a missed opportunity since mHealth has the potential to aid healthcare professionals in tracking a patient's progress and help motivate patients to work on their goals using behavior change concepts like personalization and gamification. Recognizing the time-consuming nature of creating measurable goals. This study validates an LLM-powered goal system aiming to provide a time-efficient way of goal creation for patients with SMI, on the quality of the goals it generates in collaboration with caregivers.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The adoption of recommender systems (RSs) in various domains has become increasingly popular, but concerns have been raised about their lack of transparency and interpretability. While significant advancements have been made in creating explainable RSs, there is still a shortage of automated approaches that can deliver meaningful and contextual human-centered explanations. Numerous researchers have evaluated explanations based on human-generated recommendations and explanations to address this gap. However, such approaches do not scale for real-world systems. Building on recent research that exploits Large Language Models (LLMs) for RSs, we propose leveraging the conversational capabilities of ChatGPT to provide users with personalized, human-like, and meaningful explanations for recommended items. Our paper presents one of the first user studies that measure users' perceptions of ChatGPT-generated explanations while acting as an RS. Regarding recommendations, we assess whether users prefer ChatGPT over random (but popular) recommendations. Concerning explanations, we assess users' perceptions of personalization, effectiveness, and persuasiveness. Our findings reveal that users tend to prefer ChatGPT-generated recommendations over popular ones. Additionally, personalized rather than generic explanations prove to be more effective when the recommended item is unfamiliar. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Regular physical activity is crucial for reducing the risk of non-communicable disease (NCD). With NCDs on the rise globally, there is an urgent need for effective health interventions, with chatbots emerging as a viable and cost-effective option because of limited healthcare accessibility. Although health professionals often utilize behavior change techniques (BCTs) to boost physical activity levels and enhance client engagement and motivation by affiliative humor, the efficacy of humor in chatbot-delivered interventions is not well-understood. This study conducted a randomized controlled trial to examine the impact of the generative humorous communication style in a 10-day chatbot-delivered intervention for physical activity. It further investigated whether user engagement and motivation act as mediators between the communication style and changes in physical activity levels. 66 participants engaged with the chatbots across three groups (humorous, non-humorous, and no-intervention) and responded to daily ecological momentary assessment questionnaires assessing engagement, motivation, and physical activity levels. Multilevel time series analyses revealed that an affiliative humorous communication style positively impacted physical activity levels over time, with user engagement acting as a mediator in this relationship, whereas motivation did not. These findings clarify the role of humorous communication style in chatbot-delivered interventions for physical activity, offering valuable insights for future development of intelligent conversational agents incorporating humor. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - The technological and market containment of emerging economy enterprises (EEEs) from developed countries is becoming a great challenge for EEE development. In this context, how do EEEs respond to international business challenges and achieve continuous organizational innovation? This study proposes a process model of EEEs’ organizational adaptive change to achieve innovation using the case of Hikvision, a leading Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) enterprise. The results show that the adaptive change in EEEs is a dynamic process. The negative impact of international business environment challenges on enterprise development is the starting point for enterprises to adopt change behaviors. Through adaptive change in innovation strategy, innovation architecture and innovation systems, EEEs can break through technology blockades, overcome market crises and further weaken the negative impact of such challenges. This study constructs an adaptive change process model for EEEs and proposes strategic initiatives for EEEs with the help of a national innovation system (NIS), which has policy implications for EEE strategies and industrial policy design in emerging economies. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - When communication and mass media faculty returned from a kind of exile that COVID-19 had inflicted on them, they were hit almost immediately with the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI). The fall semester of 2023 seemed to usher in a new means by which students would complete assignments that left faculty scratching their heads. They faced a new form of information retrieval that students (as well as faculty) were using that, at once, yielded more substantive prose while at the same time posed new questions about authorship, trust, reliability, bias and even personhood. The discipline of communication and media studies bears a particular responsibility to contemplate the massive change underway with the use of AI. Most of us in the field have dedicated our careers to considering the human-media-culture interface. Media ecologists, in particular, routinely explore how media shape culture, conscience and communication. Yet many of us have not known what to make of the phenomenon suddenly surging in academics and in all sectors of society. This article seeks to offer a framework, cultivated out of media ecological sensibilities, for critically examining implications of AI in the realm of communication. Specifically, we have designed a graduate course that takes up the major lines of inquiry into how AI challenges conventions and urges new paradigms in our discipline. Our article offers a course proposal that communication faculty can adopt to their curriculum. It consists of a sample course syllabus, recommended textbooks and YouTube videos, sample assignments, a review of major AI themes in scholarly and trade journals, a suggested media ecology tool for critical application (the Tetrad), and an extensive bibliography. The overall objective of our course proposal is to guide reflection on the implications of AI in various communication contexts and environments. © 2024 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - Health Recommender Systems are promising Articial-Intelligence-based tools endowing healthy lifestyles and therapy adherence in healthcare and medicine. Among the most supported areas, it is worth mentioning active aging. However, current HRS supporting AA raise ethical challenges that still need to be properly formalized and explored. This study proposes to rethink HRS for AA through an autonomy-based ethical analysis. In particular, a brief overview of the HRS’ technical aspects allows us to shed light on the ethical risks and challenges they might raise on individuals’ well-being as they age. Moreover, the study proposes a categorization, understanding, and possible preventive/mitigation actions for the elicited risks and challenges through rethinking the AI ethics core principle of autonomy. Finally, elaborating on autonomy-related ethical theories, the paper proposes an autonomy-based ethical framework and how it can foster the development of autonomy-enabling HRS for AA. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The rapid advancement of the automotive industry towards automated and semi-automated vehicles has rendered traditional methods of vehicle interaction, such as touch-based and voice command systems, inadequate for a widening range of non-driving related tasks, such as referencing objects outside of the vehicle. Consequently, research has shifted toward gestural input (e.g., hand, gaze, and head pose gestures) as a more suitable mode of interaction during driving. However, due to the dynamic nature of driving and individual variation, there are significant differences in drivers' gestural input performance. While, in theory, this inherent variability could be moderated by substantial data-driven machine learning models, prevalent methodologies lean towards constrained, single-instance trained models for object referencing. These models show a limited capacity to continuously adapt to the divergent behaviors of individual drivers and the variety of driving scenarios. To address this, we propose IcRegress, a novel regression-based incremental learning approach that adapts to changing behavior and the unique characteristics of drivers engaged in the dual task of driving and referencing objects. We suggest a more personalized and adaptable solution for multimodal gestural interfaces, employing continuous lifelong learning to enhance driver experience, safety, and convenience. Our approach was evaluated using an outside-the-vehicle object referencing use case, highlighting the superiority of the incremental learning models adapted over a single trained model across various driver traits such as handedness, driving experience, and numerous driving conditions. Finally, to facilitate reproducibility, ease deployment, and promote further research, we offer our approach as an open-source framework at https://github.com/amrgomaaelhady/IcRegress. © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Physical activity is important in the self-management of long-term conditions (LTCs). However, implementing physical activity into clinical practice is challenging, due to complex barriers including access to programmes, time pressures, and transport costs, for people with comorbidities, managing multiple responsibilities. Various digital tools exist to overcome these barriers and support wide-scale implementation to help people stay physically active. We explored the experiences, needs and preferences of healthcare professionals and commissioners, regarding the use of digital tools to support people with LTCs to self-manage using physical activity. This included barriers and facilitators to implementing digital tools to support people with LTCs in NHS settings. Semi-structured interviews were conducted (April 2021 to January 2022) in Wessex, southern England, UK. Purposive sampling was used to recruit general practitioners and healthcare professionals, and convenience sampling to recruit commissioners (n = 15). Transcripts were coded to develop conceptual themes allowing comparisons between and among perspectives, with the Normalisation Process Theory (NPT)’s four constructs used to aid interpretation. Results showed that most digital tools supporting physical activity for LTCs, are not well implemented clinically. Current digital tools were seen to lack condition-specificity, usability/acceptability evidence-base, and voluntary sector involvement (i.e., NPT: coherence or ‘making sense’). Healthcare professionals and commissioners were unlikely to engage with use of digital tools unless they were integrated into health service IT systems and professional networks (i.e., NPT: cognitive participation), or adaptable to the digital literacy levels of service users and staff (i.e., NPT: collective action–needs for implementation). In practice, this meant being technically, easy to use and culturally accessible (i.e., NPT: collective action–promoting healthcare work). COVID-19 changed professional attitudes towards digital tools, in that they saw them being viable, feasible and critical options in a way they had not done before the pandemic. Implementation was also influenced by endorsement and trustworthiness enhancing the perception of them as secure and evidence-based (i.e., NPT: reflective monitoring). Our findings highlight that consideration must be given to ensuring that digital tools are accessible to both healthcare professionals and patients, have usability/acceptability, and are adaptable to specific LTCs. To promote clinical engagement, digital tools must be evidence-based, endorsed by professional networks, and integrated into existing health systems. Digital literacy of patients and professionals is also crucial for cross-service implementation. © 2024 Gavin et al.

AB  - Internet users are inundated with attempts to persuade, including digital nudges like defaults, friction, and reinforcement. When these nudges fail to be transparent, optional, and beneficial, they can become ‘dark patterns’, categorised here under the acronym FORCES (Frame, Obstruct, Ruse, Compel, Entangle, Seduce). Elsewhere, psychological principles like negativity bias, the curiosity gap, and fluency are exploited to make social content viral, while more covert tactics including astroturfing, meta-nudging, and inoculation are used to manufacture consensus. The power of these techniques is set to increase in line with technological advances such as predictive algorithms, generative AI, and virtual reality. Digital nudges can be used for altruistic purposes including protection against manipulation, but behavioural interventions have mixed effects at best. © 2024

AB  - Given seniors’ concerns about the reliability of black-box models in health misinformation detection (HMID), there is a pressing need for explainable HMID methods that provide transparency and instill trust. Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) aims to foster understanding and trust in AI models by implementing transparency that embodies explainability and interpretability. However, most existing explainable HMID methods solely provide post-hoc explanations and neglect the interpretation of the models’ internal logic, which prevents seniors from satisfactorily accepting the HMID results. Therefore, this study proposes a transparent Knowledge Graph-aware Two-Stage approach (KG2S) driven by the dual-process theory. KG2S combines explainability and interpretability by utilizing knowledge graphs (KGs) in two stages: Knowledge Breadth Retrieval (KBR) and Knowledge Depth Reasoning (KDR). These stages correspond with the heuristic and analytic processes of the dual-process theory, which encompasses human information processing. In the KBR stage, we leverage rich facts in KGs to replicate heuristic distillation behaviors of humans through a novel similarity-diversity twofold filter. In the KDR stage, we employ a hierarchical attention network to emulate humans’ coarse-to-fine knowledge analyses during decision-making. Extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets, along with user testing, to assess the effectiveness of the proposed model. Results demonstrated that the proposed model not only outperformed competing methods in terms of HMID accuracy but also provided persuasive detection processes and reasons. Moreover, the model showed high adaptability to new topics in HMID. Our research offers valuable insights into integrating humanistic into AI algorithms and promoting the trustworthiness of AI systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, students face increasing mental health challenges, including elevated stress levels and declining well-being, leading to academic performance issues and mental health disorders. However, due to stigma and symptom underestimation, students rarely seek effective stress management solutions. Conversational agents in the health sector have shown promise in reducing stress, depression, and anxiety. Nevertheless, research on their effectiveness for students with stress remains limited. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop a conversational agent-delivered stress management coaching intervention for students called MISHA and to evaluate its effectiveness, engagement, and acceptance. METHODS: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, Swiss students experiencing stress were recruited on the web. Using a 1:1 randomization ratio, participants (N=140) were allocated to either the intervention or waitlist control group. Treatment effectiveness on changes in the primary outcome, that is, perceived stress, and secondary outcomes, including depression, anxiety, psychosomatic symptoms, and active coping, were self-assessed and evaluated using ANOVA for repeated measure and general estimating equations. RESULTS: The per-protocol analysis revealed evidence for improvement of stress, depression, and somatic symptoms with medium effect sizes (Cohen d=-0.36 to Cohen d=-0.60), while anxiety and active coping did not change (Cohen d=-0.29 and Cohen d=0.13). In the intention-to-treat analysis, similar results were found, indicating reduced stress (β estimate=-0.13, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.05; P<.001), depressive symptoms (β estimate=-0.23, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.08; P=.003), and psychosomatic symptoms (β estimate=-0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.06; P=.003), while anxiety and active coping did not change. Overall, 60% (42/70) of the participants in the intervention group completed the coaching by completing the postintervention survey. They particularly appreciated the quality, quantity, credibility, and visual representation of information. While individual customization was rated the lowest, the target group fitting was perceived as high. CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that MISHA is feasible, acceptable, and effective in reducing perceived stress among students in Switzerland. Future research is needed with different populations, for example, in students with high stress levels or compared to active controls.

AB  - As a new type of two-terminal nonlinear nanoelectronic component, memristors have shown significant application prospects in the post Moore's electron era, as they can store and process data in a single cell, further realizing brain-like neuromorphic computing modes and providing hardware support for the development of super artificial intelligence. However, whether memristors can be applied in the biomedical field to achieve information sensing for human-machine interaction is still a research gap. Herein, we demonstrate a ZrOx film-based flexible memristor, which shows promising applications as an implantable device. In particular, the working mechanisms of the implantable memristor were comprehensively analyzed, in which it has been found that the memristive behavior of the device is mainly determined by carrier tunneling. Reliable electron tunneling parameters were obtained by fitting the experimental data, which provides persuasive supporting for the research of tunneling devices. Furthermore, the memristive behavior of the device is closely related to space charge limited current (SCLC) under bending conditions. Finally, the biomedical and human-machine interaction applications can be achieved based on the implantable memristor. This work not only proves the application feasibility of flexible memristor in the field of implantable biomedicine, but also promotes the rapid development of human-machine interaction. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Over the last decade, several digital tools have been designed to provide consumers with nutritional and environmental impact information about their food choices post-consumption. Many of these tools lack behavioral change modules, have low user engagement, and ignore inherent environmental nutrition trade-offs to stimulate dietary change. This study presents the design and development of a decision support system to enhance consumer health while meeting sustainability goals from a pre-consumption perspective. The proposed decision support system, Dashboard for Improving Sustainable Healthy (DISH) food choices, employs behavioral features, traffic light labels, and nudges to inform end-users about the nutritional health performance and environmental impact of meals. DISH uses a simple metric that allows end-users to explore the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained or lost from consuming 100 kcal of a meal. The metric combines the positive or negative nutritional health effects (μ-DALYs) of consuming a meal and environmental damage (endpoint impact expressed in DALYs) on human health. In the DISH application, end-users are rewarded or deducted EnCoins, which represent the number of silver or gold coins lost or gained based on the cost ($) of environmental damage (midpoint impacts) of a meal compared to reference sustainable healthy and unsustainable and unhealthy meal. DISH's gamification module enables end-users to track the potential minutes of healthy and productive life gained/lost and gold or silver rewards or deductions from consuming 100 kcal of a selected meal through cumulative minutes gained or lost and EnCoins. In promoting a sustainable diet culture, the gamification module enables users to create groups and communities where friends and families can track their sustainability performance through meal decisions. The DISH application is currently available online and can be accessed by an end-user through any device. Further pilot studies will focus on testing the technology in partner campus cafeterias. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Online polarisation can tear the fabric of civility through reinforcing social media's perceptions of division and discord. Social media platforms often rely on content-moderation to combat polarisation, contingent on the reactive removal or fagging of content. However, this approach often remains agnostic of the underlying debate's ideas and stifes open discourse. In this study, we use prompt-tuned language models to mediate social media debates, applying the strategies of the Thomas-Kilmann Confict Mode Instrument (TKI). We evaluate multiple mediation strategies in providing targeted responses to the debates, as shown to a debate audience. Our fndings show that high-cooperativeness TKI strategies ofered more persuasive arguments, while an accommodating argument strategy was the most successful at depolarising the audience's opinion. Furthermore, high-cooperativeness strategies also increased the perception that the debaters will reach a consensus. Our work paves the way for scalable and personalised tools that mediate social media debates to encourage depolarisation. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - People sometimes put off an action because they do not perceive it as worth doing immediately, despite recognizing they should do it. Procrastination, especially in medical and healthcare fields, can lead to serious consequences, and it is an important social issue to promote cognitive and behavioral change for those reluctant to practice health behaviors. One important factor that can positively influence the psychology of procrastination is intrinsic motivation. Dopamine is known as the primary neurotransmitter associated with motivation and has been shown to relate to positive emotions and cognition. In this study, we defined personal experiences related to emotions and cognitions occurring during dopamine secretion as the person's original favorite activities (FAs). We then attempted to generate intrinsic motivational messages expected to produce dopamine secretion by partially replacing or modifying the activities the subject should do but were disinclined to do (reluctant activities (RAs)) with FAs. Preliminary experiments using questionnaire evaluations showed that dopamine-secretion-promoting intrinsic motivational messages may induce more excited feelings than general motivational messages.  © 2024 ACM.

AB  - Judicial opinions are written to be persuasive and could build public trust in court decisions, yet they can be difficult for non-experts to understand. We present a pipeline for using an AI assistant to generate simplified summaries of judicial opinions. Compared to existing expert-written summaries, these AI-generated simple summaries are more accessible to the public and more easily understood by non-experts. We show in a survey experiment that the AI summaries help respondents understand the key features of a ruling, and have higher perceived quality, especially for respondents with less formal education.  © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Introduction. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into everyday human interactions, particularly through chatbots, has significantly increased in recent years. AI-based chatbots successfully mimic human conversations by understanding user requests and responding appropriately. Improving the effectiveness of educational and professional activities related to text processing in these conditions seems extremely relevant and predetermines the goal of our study: comparing the effectiveness of interaction with ChatGPT when formulating queries in various communication strategies. Procedure and methods. The study on the effectiveness of interacting with ChatGPT was conducted using a natural experiment scheme with preliminary training. The subjects of the study were 34 employees (15 men, 19 women, aged 25-36; M = 31.6; SD = 1.8) from the marketing department of the company "Technologies of Trust". These employees performed rewriting tasks by interacting with ChatGPT within the framework of specially adapted communication strategies (persuasive and cooperative) and evaluated the chatbot's usability and the quality of the text generated by ChatGPT. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test for dependent samples was used to identify the effects of communication strategies on interaction efficiency, and exploratory factor analysis with subsequent varimax rotation was employed to identify latent variables of interaction under different communication strategies. Research Results. Comparison of the results of the ChatGPT interaction performance evaluation when using 2 strategies (cooperative and persuasive) showed that for all 11 usability indicators, there is a significant advantage of the cooperative communicative strategy at the significance level of p<0.05. However, on 6 indicators of text quality obtained through rewriting, the persuasive strategy shows advantages and on 4 of them at a significance level of p<0.05. In the course of the study it was found that the factor solutions for the studied communicative strategies differ significantly: the key factor in using the persuasive strategy is speed and accuracy in achieving goals, while in the cooperative strategy the adequate response of chatbots to objections is critical. Conclusion. The results obtained in the study contribute significantly to the understanding of communication with AI chatbots, highlighting the nuances of interacting through linguistic means typical for human communication. The findings demonstrate the complexity of choosing the optimal strategy for interacting with ChatGPT and uncover the factors that determine the features of subjective evaluation of the interaction. © 2024 LLC Ecological Help.

AB  - Creating intervention messages for smoking cessation is a labor-intensive process. Advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative for automated message generation. Two critical questions remain: 1) How to optimize LLMs to mimic human expert writing, and 2) Do LLM-generated messages meet clinical standards? We systematically examined the message generation and evaluation processes through three studies investigating prompt engineering (Study 1), decoding optimization (Study 2), and expert review (Study 3). We employed computational linguistic analysis in LLM assessment and established a comprehensive evaluation framework, incorporating automated metrics, linguistic attributes, and expert evaluations. Certified tobacco treatment specialists assessed the quality, accuracy, credibility, and persuasiveness of LLM-generated messages, using expert-written messages as the benchmark. Results indicate that larger LLMs, including ChatGPT, OPT-13B, and OPT-30B, can effectively emulate expert writing to generate well-written, accurate, and persuasive messages, thereby demonstrating the capability of LLMs in augmenting clinical practices of smoking cessation interventions. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Conventional methods of assessing attitudes towards climate change are limited in capturing authentic opinions, primarily stemming from a lack of context-specific assessment strategies and an overreliance on simplistic surveys. Game-based Assessments (GBA) have demonstrated the ability to overcome these issues by immersing participants in engaging gameplay within carefully crafted, scenario-based environments. Concurrently, advancements in AI and Natural Language Processing (NLP) show promise in enhancing the gamified testing environment, achieving this by generating context-aware, human-like dialogues that contribute to a more natural and effective assessment. Our study introduces a new technique for probing climate change attitudes by actualizing a GPT-driven chatbot system in harmony with a game design depicting a futuristic climate scenario. The correlation analysis reveals an assimilation effect, where players' post-game climate awareness tends to align with their in-game perceptions. Key predictors of pro-climate attitudes are identified as traits like'Openness' and'Agreeableness', and a preference for democratic values. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - In an effort to foster critical reflection on the usage of generative AI (genAI) during computer science writing assignments, this three-part assignment challenges students to predict whether their peers can detect which essays are generated using AI. Implemented as part of a third-year professional responsibility and technical writing course for N=200 students during Spring 2024, students individually generated two short persuasive essays, one using genAI and the other without. They then combined the two essays into a single document and submitted it for peer-review. Additionally, they formulated a guess on whether their peers would be able to detect which essay was generated as well as a rationale for their guess. Following the peer-review process, students reflected on their own experience trying to detect which essays were generated as well as the outcome of their guess about their peers abilities as well. Feedback indicates its effectiveness in engaging students in their understanding of the potentials and limitations of genAI. Recommended prerequisites include a clear course AI-usage policy and a brief overview of genAI prompt engineering. © 2024 Owner/Author(s).

AB  - The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) has led many companies to embrace AI-oriented changes; leaders’ AI-oriented change behaviors have therefore become increasingly prevalent in contemporary organizations. However, knowledge on the effects of such behavior remains limited. Additionally, literature on change-oriented behavior (e.g., taking charge, change-oriented citizenship) has uniformly demonstrated that it is beneficial for employees, teams, and organizations. We challenge this consensus by revealing that leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior has mixed effects on employee outcomes. In Study 1, we developed a scale for leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior and assessed its psychometric properties using samples from the United States. In Study 2, we tested our full model with a three-wave, multi-source field study in China. The results show that leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior is positively associated with employee performance orientation, in turn increasing both employee job performance and unethical behaviors. Furthermore, employee trait competitiveness moderates the positive effect of leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior on employee job performance and unethical behavior via employee performance orientation. By revealing the perils and benefits of leaders’ AI-oriented change behavior, our research contributes to the literature on change-oriented behavior and performance orientation. © The International Society for Quality-of-Life Studies (ISQOLS) and Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for task-oriented dialogue across a range of domains. The use of LLMs in health and fitness coaching is under-explored. Behavior science frameworks such as COM-B, which conceptualizes behavior change in terms of capability (C), Opportunity (O) and Motivation (M), can be used to architect coaching interventions in a way that promotes sustained change. Here we aim to incorporate behavior science principles into an LLM using two knowledge infusion techniques: coach message priming (where exemplar coach responses are provided as context to the LLM), and dialogue re-ranking (where the COM-B category of the LLM output is matched to the inferred user need). Simulated conversations were conducted between the primed or unprimed LLM and a member of the research team, and then evaluated by 8 human raters. Ratings for the primed conversations were significantly higher in terms of empathy and actionability. The same raters also compared a single response generated by the unprimed, primed and reranked models, finding a significant uplift in actionability and empathy from the re-ranking technique. This is a proof of concept of how behavior science frameworks can be infused into automated conversational agents for a more principled coaching experience. Copyright: © 2024 Hegde et al.

AB  - Realistic co-speech gestures are important to anthropomorphize ECAs, as nonverbal behavior improves expressiveness of their speech greatly. However, the existing approaches to generating co-speech gestures with sufficient details (including fingers, etc.) in 3D scenarios are indeed rare. Additionally, they hardly address the problem of abnormal gestures, temporal-spatial coherence and diversity of gesture sequences comprehensively. To handle abnormal gesture issues, we put forward an angle conversion method to remove body part length from the original in-the-wild video dataset via transferring coordinates of human upper body key points into relative deflection angles and pitch angles. We also propose a neural network called HARP with encoder-decoder architecture to transfer MFCC featured speech audio into aforementioned angles on the basis of CNN and LSTM. The angles then can be rendered as corresponding co-speech gestures. Compared with the other latest approaches, the co-speech gestures generated by HARP are proved to be almost as good as the real person, i.e., they have strong temporal-spatial coherence, diversity, persuasiveness and credibility. Our approach puts finer control on co-speech gestures than most of the existing works by handling all key points of the human upper body. It is more feasible for industrial application, since HARP can be adaptive to any human upper body model.

AB  - Prehypertension, an early stage in the development of hypertension, impacts a substantial segment of the adult population worldwide. Addressing this issue, our study introduces HabitBot, an AI-driven chatbot tailored to encourage physical activity (PA) habits among individuals with prehypertension. HabitBot combines natural language processing with multidisciplinary approaches, drawing from both theoretical frameworks and empirical studies. The chatbot development followed a systematic, five-phase process: comprehensive needs assessment, literature review on behavior change theories, analysis for selecting effective behavior change techniques (BCTs), prototype design through intervention mapping, and refining the intervention based on user feedback. The outcome includes a prototype that integrates the Health Action Process Approach and Habit Formation Theory, utilizing twelve identified BCTs effective in fostering PA habits. User feedback further refined the chatbot across multiple dimensions such as user interface, content accessibility, and privacy. HabitBot exemplifies an innovative integration of behavior change strategies with advanced language model technology, paving the way for digital health interventions in chronic disease prevention. Future studies should assess its long-term efficacy in habit formation and explore its applicability to various demographic groups  © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Expedited implementation of evidence into practice and policymaking is critical to ensure the delivery of effective care and improve health-care outcomes. Implementation science deals with the designing of methods and strategies for increasing and facilitating the uptake of evidence into practice and policymaking. Nevertheless, the process of designing and selecting methods and strategies for implementing evidence is complicated because of the complexity of health-care settings where implementation is desired. Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized a range of fields, including genomics, education, drug trials, research, and health care. This commentary discusses how AI can be leveraged to expedite implementation science efforts for transforming health-care practice. Four key aspects of AI use in implementation science are highlighted: (a) AI for implementation planning (e.g., needs assessment, predictive analytics, and data management), (b) AI for developing implementation tools and guidelines, (c) AI for designing and applying implementation strategies, and (d) AI for monitoring and evaluating implementation outcomes. Use of AI along the implementation continuum from planning to delivery and evaluation can enable more precise and accurate implementation of evidence into practice.

AB  - Developments in factor analysis (Spearman in Am J Psychol 15:201-292, 1904); Thurstone in Multiple factor analysis, University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1947), multidimensional scaling (Torgerson in Theory and methods of scaling, Wiley Hoboken, New Jersey, 1958; Young and Householder in Psychometrika, 3:19–22, 1938), the Galileo model (Woelfel and Fink in The measurement of communication processes: galileo theory and method, Academic Press Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1980), and, more recently, in computer science, artificial intelligence, computational linguistics, network analysis and other disciplines (Woelfel in Qual Quant 54:263–278, 2020) have shown that human cognitive and cultural beliefs and attitudes can be modeled as movement through a high-dimensional non-Euclidean space. This article demonstrates the theoretical and methodological contribution that multidimensional scaling makes to understand attitude change associated with the COVID-19 vaccine. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.

AB  - Purpose: Artificial intelligence-based chatbots are frequently used to handle customer complaints in the hospitality and tourism sectors; however, little is known about their recovery strategies. Further, the widespread usage of chatbots is anticipated to affect customers' favorable responses. Therefore, this study aims to examine how chatbots’ symbolic recovery influences customer forgiveness through customer empathy and explore the moderating effect of time pressure on it. Moreover, it investigates the effect of customer forgiveness on customer reconciliation and customer continuous trust. Design/methodology/approach: Structural equation modeling was used to analyze data collected from 994 customers who have experienced chatbot recovery in tourism and hospitality during the past four months. Findings: The results show that chatbots’ symbolic recovery stimulates customer forgiveness, which subsequently positively affects customer reconciliation and customer continuous trust. Moreover, customer empathy partially mediates the effect of chatbots’ symbolic recovery on customer forgiveness, and time pressure plays a moderating role in the relationship between chatbots’ symbolic recovery and customer forgiveness. Practical implications: The results offer highly persuasive insights that may be used to promote chatbots’ symbolic recovery in tourism organizations. The effectiveness of chatbots’ symbolic recovery in achieving customer forgiveness will motivate tourism organizations to use chatbots efficiently in service recovery. Originality/value: This study extends the theoretical scope of chatbot research by investigating the symbolic recovery capabilities of chatbots. Moreover, it expands the application of SOR theory in the context of chatbot service recovery and reveals the underlying mechanism behind the impact of chatbots’ symbolic recovery on customer forgiveness, thus building and testing an integrative model of chatbot service recovery. © 2024, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the context of global integration and increasing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, evaluating the AI literacy of pre-service teachers is crucial. As future architects of educational systems, pre-service teachers must not only possess pedagogical expertise but also a strong foundation in AI literacy. This quantitative study examines AI literacy among 529 pre-service teachers in a Nigerian university, utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) for comprehensive analysis. The research explores various dimensions of AI literacy, revealing that a profound understanding of AI significantly predicts positive outcomes in AI use, detection, ethics, creation, and problem-solving. However, no correlation exists between AI knowledge and emotion regulation or the assumption that active AI use enhances AI detection capabilities. The study identifies a trade-off between AI application and creation, emphasizing the ethical considerations intertwined with emotional and persuasive facets of AI use. It also supports the link between AI creation and problem-solving, emphasizing the foundational role of AI knowledge in shaping diverse aspects of AI literacy among pre-service teachers. The findings offer valuable insights for educators, administrators, policymakers, and researchers aiming to enhance AI literacy in pre-service teacher education programs. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The exploitation of Motivational Interviewing concepts for text analysis contributes to gaining valuable insights into individuals’ perspectives and attitudes towards behaviour change. The scarcity of labelled user data poses a persistent challenge and impedes technical advances in research under non-English language scenarios. To address the limitations of manual data labelling, we propose a semi-supervised learning method as a means to augment an existing training corpus. Our approach leverages machine-translated user-generated data sourced from social media communities and employs self-training techniques for annotation. To that end, we consider various source contexts and conduct an evaluation of multiple classifiers trained on various augmented datasets. The results indicate that this weak labelling approach does not yield improvements in the overall classification capabilities of the models. However, notable enhancements were observed for the minority classes. We conclude that several factors, including the quality of machine translation, can potentially bias the pseudo-labelling models and that the imbalanced nature of the data and the impact of a strict pre-filtering threshold need to be taken into account as inhibiting factors. © 2024 Sociedad Española para el Procesamiento del Lenguaje Natural.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThe internet has changed the way children can work and play. With the preferences of the youth population constantly evolving, it is important that parents and pediatricians continue to be informed of the ways children spend their time on the internet. Online gaming continues to soar in popularity, as does school usage of educational platforms.Recent findingsRoblox, Fortnite, and Minecraft are three examples of games that have widespread popularity among youth populations. Though none of the game are designed to display graphic violence, sexual content, or other features that could be considered off-limits for children, there still ways for children to exposed to inappropriate material or engage with strangers. The rise in popularity of eSports also reflects changing attitudes about the value of gaming. On the educational side, school-student platforms and powerful artificial intelligence (AI) tools are becoming more and more prevalent.SummaryParents should not simply know which games or educational tools their children are using, but understand them. This article seeks to provide some insight into popular games and platforms so that parents and pediatricians can make better decisions about what children access. © 2024 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

AB  - Background: The globally rising prevalence of obesity highlights the importance of implementing effective methods for prevention and treatment. In this context, personalized nutrition (PN) is being discussed as a promising approach. The Food4Me study, a clinical trial investigating the effectiveness of PN interventions, demonstrated that tailoring dietary advice to individual needs is more likely to initiate behavior changes than standard dietary guidelines. However, the accessibility of PN remains a challenge due to financial and structural barriers. ChatGPT, a freely available, natural language processing model published in 2022, might provide a solution to increase the availability of personalized nutrition to a broader population. Methods: To investigate ChatGPT's potential to provide accurate and reliable personalized dietary recommendations, we conducted a comparative analysis, comparing its recommendations with those of the Food4Me algorithm. We selected 20 obese subjects of the German Food4Me sub-cohort and entered their baseline data into ChatGPT (version 3.5). For each subject, a separate chat space was set up, maintaining consistent wording and prompt order throughout all chats to ensure comparability. The prompts were written from a first-person perspective, simulating an authentic scenario of average users asking for dietary recommendations. ChatGPT's responses were compared to the Food4Me feedback reports that had been provided to the selected subjects within the study. Results: ChatGPT may provide suitable personalized dietary advice and holds some noteworthy advantages over the Food4Me algorithm, but still tends to produce recommendations with inconsistent and unpredictable errors, for example, regarding intakes of macro- or micronutrients. Conclusion: Currently, it is not advisable for individuals without nutritional expertise to rely on ChatGPT for personalized dietary recommendations. Nevertheless, ChatGPT remains a promising approach and may develop into a reliable tool for PN with further updates and fine-tuning in the future. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of big data and artificial intelligence technology, data-driven automatic driving vehicle lane change intention recognition has become an active research area in the transportation field. Numerous studies have reported innovative and practical research results. However, this field still presents common technical challenges, such as accurately identifying the lane change process, handling missing lane change labels, and addressing imbalanced data categories. These issues remain the focal points of current research. This paper aims to classify and organize various data-driven methods, mainly focusing on lane change intention recognition methods based on traditional machine learning, deep learning, and ensemble learning. In the academic community, two primary approaches exist for identifying lane change behavior. The first approach mainly focuses on the vehicle not crossing the lane line, which is suitable for early recognition of the driver’s intention to change lanes. The second approach focuses on the actual crossing of lane markings by vehicles, which is often considered the complete lane change process. In academic research on lane change intention annotation, the selection of fixed time windows and heading angle thresholds plays a crucial role in the accuracy of annotation. These parameters affect the accurate recognition of lane change behavior and are directly related to the stability and reliability of autonomous driving and intelligent transportation system performance. Therefore, researchers have conducted in-depth investigations on the impact of these two parameters on annotation accuracy. To identify the optimal fixed time window and heading angle threshold, researchers have used the grid search optimization algorithm. This method performs well in fixed driving scenarios by traversing all possible parameter combinations and selecting the optimal parameters according to preset evaluation criteria. However, in practical applications, driving scenarios often exhibit diversity and complexity. Different driving environments, road conditions, and driving styles can impact the recognition of lane change intentions. Therefore, achieving adaptive parameter adjustment so that the annotation algorithm maintains high accuracy across various driving scenarios remains a challenging problem. To address the issue of imbalanced data categories in lane changing, researchers adopt two strategies. The first strategy involves adjusting the data sampling method, and under-sampling and oversampling techniques are used to balance the number of samples in each category. The second strategy involves the use of classification models with strong adaptability to imbalanced data, such as ensemble learning algorithms or cost-sensitive learning models, to maintain good classification performance. © 2024 Science Press.

AB  - Because of COVID-19 lockdowns, managers and administrators have begun to look for new ways to monitor and control their stranded-at-home workforce. Yet long before the pandemic already, advancements in datification, sensorization, and artificial intelligence have given rise to what we call connected workplace surveillance. At the heart of this new mode of employee monitoring and control is the extension of the scope of data collection beyond what is necessary and reasonable for performance appraisals or managerial oversight. This includes treating an employee’s body as a data source, disrespecting the boundaries between business and private life, or using gathered surveillance information for subtle persuasion, manipulation, and coercion. This article provides a new perspective on control theory, examining the characteristics of connected surveillance and comparing it to visual or computerized surveillance. Taking an employee-centric position, it also proposes a research agenda for critical, behavioral, and design-oriented scholars who wish to explore the identified issues. © Association for Information Technology Trust 2023.

AB  - Conversational agents are increasingly used to address emotional needs on top of information needs. One use case of increasing interest are counselling-style mental health and behaviour change interventions, with large language model (LLM)-based approaches becoming more popular. Research in this context so far has been largely system-focused, foregoing the aspect of user behaviour and the impact this can have on LLM-generated texts. To address this issue, we share a dataset containing text-based user interactions related to behaviour change with two GPT-4-based conversational agents collected in a preregistered user study. This dataset includes conversation data, user language analysis, perception measures, and user feedback for LLM-generated turns, and can offer valuable insights to inform the design of such systems based on real interactions. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Policy advising in government centers on the analysis of public problems and the developing of recommendations for deal- ing with them. In carrying out this work, policy analysts consult a variety of sources and work to synthesize that body of evidence into useful decision support documents commonly called briefing notes. Advances in natural language process- ing (NLP) have led to the continuing development of tools that can undertake a similar task. Given a brief prompt, a large language model (LLM) can synthesize information in content databases. This article documents the findings from an exper- iment that tested whether contemporary NLP technology is capable of producing public policy relevant briefing notes that expert evaluators judge to be useful. The research involved two stages. First, briefing notes were created using three mod- els: NLP generated; human generated; and NLP generated/human edited. Next, two panels of retired senior public servants (with only one panel informed of the use of NLP in the experiment) were asked to judge the briefing notes using a heuristic evaluation rubric. The findings indicate that contemporary NLP tools were not able to, on their own, generate useful policy briefings. However, the feedback from the expert evaluators indicates that automatically generated briefing notes might serve as a useful supplement to the work of human policy analysts. And the speed with which the capabilities of NLP tools are developing, supplemented with access to a larger corpus of previously prepared policy briefings and other policy-relevant material, suggests that the quality of automatically generated briefings may improve significantly in the coming years. The article concludes with reflections on what such improvements might mean for the future practice of policy analysis.  Copyright © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).

This article conceptualizes AI as a persuasion agent and reviews the recent literature on AI through the lens of persuasion knowledge. It presents research on AI acceptance and aversion in terms of the properties of the AI itself (e.g., anthropomorphism, functionality, and usability), the properties of individuals interacting with AI (e.g., individual differences in judgments of AI, perceived uniqueness, and task performance), and the context of the interaction (e.g., type of decision, domain, and usage occasion). In assessing AI interaction research through this lens, we systematically categorize these findings and identify promising future research directions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Childhood obesity and overweight are concerning issues worldwide with significant health and social implications, making it necessary to implement prevention and intervention policies. Engaging children through creative and playful methods is an effective approach to motivating behavior change. Social robots have emerged as promising tools in education and persuasive technology, due to their interactive and engaging nature. This paper presents a study examining the potential of a social robot acting as a nutrition coach for children, by comparing interactions with a social robot versus a chatbot. Results suggest that, in the short term, the social robot was perceived as more persuasive, increasing participants' intention to adopt healthier eating behavior. These findings offer insights for the development of personalized nutrition coaching for children. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Billions of dollars are invested annually in leadership development globally; however, few programs are evidence-based, risking adverse outcomes, and wasted time and money. This article describes the novel Inspire Nursing Leadership Program (INLP) and the outcomes-based process of incorporating gold standard evidence into its design, delivery, and evaluation. The INLP design was informed by a needs analysis, research evidence, and by nursing, Indigenous, and equity, diversity, and inclusion experts. The program’s goals include enabling participants to develop leadership capabilities, cultivate strategic community partnerships, lead innovation projects, and connect with colleagues. Design features include an outcomes-based approach, the LEADS framework, and alignment with the principles of adult learning. Components include leadership impact projects, 360-assessments, blended interactive sessions, coaching, mentoring, and application and reflection exercises. The evaluation framework and subsequent proposed research design align to top-quality standards. Healthcare leadership programs must be evidence-based to support leaders in improving and transforming health systems. © 2024 The Canadian College of Health Leaders. All rights reserved.

AB  - Despite extensive evidence related to the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and its complications, most people at risk for and people who have diabetes do not receive recommended guideline-based care. Clinical implementation of proven care strategies is of the utmost importance because without this, even the most impressive research findings will remain of purely academic interest. In this review, we discuss the promise and challenges of implementing effective approaches to diabetes prevention and care in the real-world setting. We describe successful implementation projects in three critical areas of diabetes care—diabetes prevention, glycemic control, and prevention of diabetes-related complications—which provide a basis for further clinical translation and an impetus to improve the prevention and control of T2D in the community. Advancing the clinical translation of evidence-based care must include recognition of and assessment of existing gaps in care, identification of barriers to the delivery of optimal care, and a locally appropriate plan to address and overcome these barriers. Care models that promote team-based approaches, rather than reliance on patient-provider interactions, will enhance the delivery of contemporary comprehensive diabetes care. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - This article addresses the impact of transient pressure anomalies in hydraulic systems, triggered by the opening or closing of valves or pumps, instantly disturbing the line of hydraulic gradient (LGH). This variation in pressure has significant consequences both in hydraulic and structural terms for water networks. Most of the existing techniques to detect transients in water distribution systems use asynchronous methods, generating timeless information that limits the response capacity in critical situations. Therefore, an automatic transient detection system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed, capable of identifying overpressure or underpressure pulses in soft real-time, activating alarms to facilitate decision-making. This approach helps maintain the safety of the water distribution system and prevent leaks in the network. Furthermore, a model of the transient behavior of pressure and flow is presented by linearizing the water hammer equations from the Laplace transform, thus generating a transfer function that describes the algebraic relationship between the outlet and inlet of the hydraulic system. • The transient analysis of the hydraulic system prototype underscores its high sensitivity to initial conditions, attributed to turbulence. This observation suggests the possible presence of a dynamic strange attractor related to water hammer phenomena in pressure pipes. • The methodology involving transfer functions and state-space models enables the assessment of how leaks impact the transient responses of the system, including the magnitude, duration, and frequency of disturbances generated by them. • The proposed method introduces a dynamic transfer function capable of identifying instantaneous changes over time in terms of flow and pressure. © 2024

AB  - Background: Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) present a significant global public health issue, with disparities in STI rates often observed across ethnic groups. The study investigates the impact of Chatbot-Assisted Self Assessment (CASA) on the intentions for sexual health screening within minoritised ethnic groups (MEGs) at risk of STIs as well as the subsequent use of a chatbot for booking STI screening. Methods: A simulation within-subject design was utilised to evaluate the effect of CASA on intentions for STI/HIV screening, concern about STIs, and attitudes towards STI screening. Screening intentions served as the dependent variable, while demographic and behavioural factors related to STI/HIV risk were the independent variables. ANCOVA tests were conducted to measure the impact of CASA on these perceptions. Results: Involving 548 participants (54% women, 66% black, average age = 30 years), the study found that CASA positively influenced screening intentions t(547) = -10.3, P < 0.001], concerns about STIs t(544) = -4.96, P < 0.001, and attitudes towards sexual health screening [t(543) = -4.36, P < 0.001. Positive attitudes towards CASA were observed (mean, 13.30; s.d., 6.73; range, -17 to 21). About 72% of users who booked STI screening appointments via chatbot were from MEGs. Conclusion: CASA increased motivations for STI screening intentions among ethnically diverse communities. The intervention's non-judgemental nature and the chatbot's ability to emulate sexual history-taking were critical in fostering an environment conducive to behavioural intention change. The study's high acceptability indicates the potential for broader application in digital health interventions. However, the limitation of not tracking actual post-intervention behaviour warrants further investigation into CASA's real-world efficacy.  © 2024 The Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - We study the problem of designing the optimal k-memory messaging scheme in a dynamic environment. Specifically, a sender, who can perfectly observe the state of a dynamic environment but cannot take actions, aims to persuade an uninformed, far-sighted receiver to take actions to maximize the long-term utility of the sender, by sending messages. We focus on k-memory messaging schemes, i.e., at each time step, the sender's messaging scheme depends on information from the previous k steps. After receiving a message, the self-interested receiver derives a posterior belief and takes action. The immediate reward of each player can be unaligned, thus the sender needs to ensure persuasiveness when designing the messaging scheme. We first formulate this problem as a bi-linear program. Then we show that there are infinitely many non-trivial persuasive messaging schemes for any problem instance. Moreover, we show that when the sender uses a k-memory messaging scheme, the optimal strategy for the receiver is also a kmemory strategy. We propose a fast heuristic algorithm for this problem and show that it can be extended to the setting where the sender has threat ability. We experimentally evaluate our algorithm, comparing it with the solution obtained by the Gurobi solver, in terms of performance and running time, in both settings. Extensive experimental results show that our algorithm outperforms the solution in running time, yet achieves comparable performance.

AB  - Proposals for strategies for dialogical argumentation often focus on situations where one of the agents wins the dialogue and the other agent loses. Yet in real-world argumentation, it is common for agents to not view a dialogue as a zero-sum game. Rather, the agents may enter into a dialogue with divergent but not diametrically opposing views on what is important (e.g. a doctor trying to persuade a patient to give up smoking when the patient would like to be healthy but gets some pleasure from smoking). Furthermore, there may be multiple persuasion goals (e.g. reduce smoking of cigarettes to 20 per day, or 10 per day, or 5 per day, or 1 per day, or 0 per day, where the doctor prefers 0 per day most, and 20 per day least, whereas the patient might prefer 5 per day most, and 20 per day and 0 per day least). In order to develop persuasive chatbots that support this kind of behaviour change application, this paper presents dialogue protocols, and a strategy for a chatbot, to optimize choice of moves. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - This paper examines academic institutions' heterogeneous initial responses to generative AI (GAI) tools like ChatGPT and factors influencing increased acceptance over time. GAI's disruptive nature coupled with uncertainty about impacts poses adoption challenges. However, external pressures from stakeholders seeking GAI integration contribute to changing attitudes. Actions of institutional change agents also drive growing acceptance by increasing awareness of GAI advantages. They challenge prevailing logics emphasizing assessments, proposing new values around employability and job performance. Additionally, academic institutions reevaluating GAI's value creation potential through applications and evolving business models contributes to favorable responses. The paper proposes an institutional theory framework explaining dynamics underpinning academic institutions' assimilation of GAI. It highlights how various mechanisms like external pressures, institutional entrepreneurs' theorization efforts justifying technology use, and internal sensemaking shape institutional norms and values, enabling academic systems' adaptation. The study informs policy and practice while directing future research toward validating propositions empirically and examining contextual dimensions including industry characteristics affecting GAI adoption. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Mental health disorders are a leading cause of disability worldwide, and there is a global shortage of mental health professionals. AI chatbots have emerged as a potential solution, offering accessible and scalable mental health interventions. This study aimed to conduct a scoping review to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of AI chatbots in treating mental health conditions. A literature search was conducted across multiple databases, including MEDLINE, Scopus, and PsycNet, as well as using AI-powered tools like Microsoft Copilot and Consensus. Relevant studies on AI chatbot interventions for mental health were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed independently by multiple reviewers. The search yielded 15 eligible studies covering various application areas, such as mental health support during COVID-19, interventions for specific conditions (e.g., depression, anxiety, substance use disorders), preventive care, health promotion, and usability assessments. AI chatbots demonstrated potential benefits in improving mental and emotional well-being, addressing specific mental health conditions, and facilitating behavior change. However, challenges related to usability, engagement, and integration with existing healthcare systems were identified. AI chatbots hold promise for mental health interventions, but widespread adoption hinges on improving usability, engagement, and integration with healthcare systems. Enhancing personalization and context-specific adaptation is key. Future research should focus on large-scale trials, optimal human–AI integration, and addressing ethical and social implications. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - While blood is crucial for many surgeries and patient treatments worldwide, it cannot be produced artificially. Fulfilling the demand for blood products on average days is already a major challenge in countries like South Africa and Ghana. In these countries, less than 1 % of the population donates blood and most of the donations come from first-time donors who do not return. Sufficient new, first-time and even lapsed donors must be motivated to donate regularly. This study argues that blood donation behavior change support systems (BDBCSS) can be beneficially applied to support blood donor management in African countries. In this study, the design science research (DSR) approach is applied in order to derive generic design principles for BDBCSS and instantiate the design knowledge in prototypes for a blood donation app and a chatbot. The design principles were evaluated in a field study in South Africa. The results demonstrate the positive effects of BDBCSS on users’ intentional and developmental blood donation behavior. This study contributes to research and practice by proposing a new conceptualization of blood donation information systems support and a nascent design theory for BDBCSS that builds on behavioral theories as well as related work on blood donation information systems. Thus, the study provides valuable implications for designing preventive health BCSS by stating three design principles for a concrete application context in healthcare. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - In the field of artificial intelligence-based fitness apps, the effective integration of behavior change techniques (BCTs) is critical for promoting physical activity and improving health outcomes. However, the specific BCTs employed by apps and their impact on user engagement and behavior change are not explored sufficiently. This study investigates the Freeletics fitness app through a mixed-methods approach to evaluate the use of BCTs. In the quantitative analysis, fifteen unique BCTs were identified based on the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy (V1). In the qualitative analysis, user reviews (n=400) were examined to understand perspectives on the app’s effectiveness in promoting behavior change. Goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring of behavior, and social support were among the most prevalent BCTs identified in the Freeletics app, and their effectiveness in enhancing user engagement and promoting behavior change was also highlighted by user reviews. Among the areas of improvement identified in the study were the need for simplifying personalization options and addressing user concerns regarding the specificity of feedback. The study underscores the importance of integrating BCTs effectively within AI-based fitness apps to drive user engagement and facilitate behavior change. It contributes valuable insights into the design and implementation of BCTs in fitness apps and offers recommendations for developers, emphasizing the significance of goal setting, feedback mechanisms, self-monitoring, and social support. By understanding the impact of specific BCTs on user behavior and addressing user concerns, developers can create more effective fitness apps, ultimately promoting healthier lifestyles and positive behavior change. © 2023 Society for Public Health Education.

AB  - Chatbots' role in fostering self-reflection is now widely recognized, especially in inducing users' behavior change. While the benefits of 24/7 availability, scalability, and consistent responses have been demonstrated in contexts such as healthcare and tutoring to help one form a new habit, their utilization in coaching necessitating deeper introspective dialogue to induce leadership growth remains unexplored. This paper explores the potential of such a chatbot powered by recent Large Language Models (LLMs) in collaboration with professional coaches in the field of executive coaching. Through a design workshop with them and two weeks of user study involving ten coach-client pairs, we explored the feasibility and nuances of integrating chatbots to complement human coaches. Our findings highlight the benefits of chatbots' ubiquity and reasoning capabilities enabled by LLMs while identifying their limitations and design necessities for effective collaboration between human coaches and chatbots. By doing so, this work contributes to the foundation for augmenting one's self-reflective process with prevalent conversational agents through the human-in-the-loop approach. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - To address the low accuracy and inefficiency of current lane-change trajectory prediction methods for human-driven vehicles, this study develops a neural network lane-change trajectory prediction model with hyperparametric optimization capability using Bayesian optimization and gated recurrent units to consider the effect of lane-change intention on vehicle lane-change behavior and to predict it. The proposed model was instantiated using trajectory data of 8,721 vehicles. The results show that the overall recognition accuracy of intention recognition under the optimal input is 93.54%, and the recognition accuracy of keeping straight, left lane-change and right lane-change is 95.59%, 91.72%, and 93.30%, respectively. The root mean square errors of the predicted and actual trajectories to the left and to the right under the optimal input are 0.2582 and 0.2957, respectively. This paper demonstrates that, for the intention recognition module, the low-dimensional input enables the model to obtain high prediction accuracy, while for the trajectory prediction module, the high-latitude input enables the model to obtain a low prediction error. The developed trajectory prediction model can be used to assist in driving decision-making, path planning, and so forth. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2023.

AB  - Lights out! With the escalating climate crisis, eco-feedback has gained prominence over the last decade. However, traditional approaches could be underperforming as they often use data-driven strategies and assume that people only need additional information about their consumption to change behavior. A proposed path to overcome this issue is to design eco-feedback to foster emotional connections with users. However, not much is known about the effectiveness of such designs. In this paper, we propose a novel care-based eco-feedback system. Central to the system is a Tamagotchi-inspired digital character named Infi who gets its life force from the user's energy savings. Additionally, we harness the latest advancements in generative artificial intelligence to enhance emotional attachment through conversational interactions that users can have with Infi. The results of a randomized controlled experiment (N=420) convey the fact that this design increases emotional attachment, which in turn increases energy-saving behavior. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have raised the prospect of scalable, automated, and fine-grained political microtargeting on a scale previously unseen; however, the persuasive influence of microtargeting with LLMs remains unclear. Here, we build a custom web application capable of integrating self-reported demographic and political data into GPT-4 prompts in real-time, facilitating the live creation of unique messages tailored to persuade individual users on four political issues. We then deploy this application in a preregistered randomized control experiment (n = 8,587) to investigate the extent to which access to individual-level data increases the persuasive influence of GPT-4. Our approach yields two key findings. First, messages generated by GPT-4 were broadly persuasive, in some cases increasing support for an issue stance by up to 12 percentage points. Second, in aggregate, the persuasive impact of microtargeted messages was not statistically different from that of non-microtargeted messages (4.83 vs. 6.20 percentage points, respectively, P = 0.226). These trends hold even when manipulating the type and number of attributes used to tailor the message. These findings suggest—contrary to widespread speculation—that the influence of current LLMs may reside not in their ability to tailor messages to individuals but rather in the persuasiveness of their generic, nontargeted messages. We release our experimental dataset, GPTarget2024, as an empirical baseline for future research. © 2024 the Author(s). Published by PNAS.

AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear etiology. Despite significant research efforts, developing disease-modifying treatments for PD remains a major unmet medical need. Notably, drug repositioning is becoming an increasingly attractive direction in drug discovery, and computational approaches offer a relatively quick and resource-saving method for identifying testable hypotheses that promote drug repositioning. We used an artificial intelligence (AI)-based drug repositioning strategy to screen an extensive compound library and identify potential therapeutic agents for PD. Our AI-driven analysis revealed that efavirenz and nevirapine, approved for treating human immunodeficiency virus infection, had distinct profiles, suggesting their potential effects on PD pathophysiology. Among these, efavirenz attenuated α-synuclein (α-syn) propagation and associated neuroinflammation in the brain of preformed α-syn fibrils-injected A53T α-syn Tg mice and α-syn propagation and associated behavioral changes in the C. elegans BiFC model. Through in-depth molecular investigations, we found that efavirenz can modulate cholesterol metabolism and mitigate α-syn propagation, a key pathological feature implicated in PD progression by regulating CYP46A1. This study opens new avenues for further investigation into the mechanisms underlying PD pathology and the exploration of additional drug candidates using advanced computational methodologies. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Introduction Asthma attacks are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality but are preventable in most if detected and treated promptly. However, the changes that occur physiologically and behaviourally in the days and weeks preceding an attack are not always recognised, highlighting a potential role for technology. The aim of this study 'DIGIPREDICT' is to identify early digital markers of asthma attacks using sensors embedded in smart devices including watches and inhalers, and leverage health and environmental datasets and artificial intelligence, to develop a risk prediction model to provide an early, personalised warning of asthma attacks. Methods and analysis A prospective sample of 300 people, 12 years or older, with a history of a moderate or severe asthma attack in the last 12 months will be recruited in New Zealand. Each participant will be given a smart watch (to assess physiological measures such as heart and respiratory rate), peak flow meter, smart inhaler (to assess adherence and inhalation) and a cough monitoring application to use regularly over 6 months with fortnightly questionnaires on asthma control and well-being. Data on sociodemographics, asthma control, lung function, dietary intake, medical history and technology acceptance will be collected at baseline and at 6 months. Asthma attacks will be measured by self-report and confirmed with clinical records. The collected data, along with environmental data on weather and air quality, will be analysed using machine learning to develop a risk prediction model for asthma attacks. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the New Zealand Health and Disability Ethics Committee (2023 FULL 13541). Enrolment began in August 2023. Results will be presented at local, national and international meetings, including dissemination via community groups, and submission for publication to peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - Amidst the increasingly prevalent smartphone addiction, we introduce StayFocused, a mobile app to help people focus on their tasks at hand by reducing compulsive smartphone use. Besides guiding people to set focus sessions for non-screen time, we incorporated reflective prompts probing individuals' phone-checking intentions whenever they check their phones and a chatbot to deliver these prompts. To examine the effects of the reflective prompts and the chatbot support, we designed three versions of StayFocused: baseline, reflection, and reflection-chatbot, and conducted a stage-based between-subjects study with 36 college students over five weeks. We found that participants who received the reflective prompts were able to focus longer and resist distractions, and those with chatbot support seemed to better maintain their smartphone use reduction. By highlighting how participants reflected on their focus session activities and their preferences for the chatbot, we discuss the implications of designing persuasive conversational interfaces to reduce unintended behaviors. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - This paper presents a novel approach to cognitive planning based on an NP-complete logic of explicit and implicit belief whose satisfiability checking problem is reduced to SAT. We illustrate the potential for application of our model by formalizing and then implementing a human–machine interaction scenario in which an artificial agent interacts with a human agent through dialogue and tries to motivate her to practice a sport. To make persuasion effective, the artificial agent needs a model of the human’s beliefs and desires which is built during interaction through a sequence of belief revision operations. We consider two cognitive planning algorithms and compare their performances, a brute force algorithm based on SAT and a QBF-based algorithm. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Interactive software agents, such as chatbots, are progressively being used in the area of health and well-being. In such applications, where agents engage with users in interpersonal conversations for, e.g., coaching, comfort or behavior-change interventions, there is an increased need for understanding agents’ empathic capabilities. In the current state-of-the-art, there are no tools to do that. In order to understand empathic capabilities in interactive software agents, we need a precise notion of empathy. The literature discusses a variety of definitions of empathy, but there is no consensus of a formal definition. Based on a systematic literature review and a qualitative analysis of recent approaches to empathy in interactive agents for health and well-being, a formal definition—an ontology—of empathy is developed. We present the potential of the formal definition in a controlled user-study by applying it as a tool for assessing empathy in two state-of-the-art health and well-being chatbots; Replika and Wysa. Our findings suggest that our definition captures necessary conditions for assessing empathy in interactive agents, and how it can uncover and explain trends in changing perceptions of empathy over time. The definition, implemented in Web Ontology Language (OWL), may serve as an automated tool, enabling systems to recognize empathy in interactions—be it an interactive agent evaluating its own empathic performance or an intelligent system assessing the empathic capability of its interlocutors. © 2023

AB  - [Purpose/significance] With the advancement of AI composition technology and the growing integration of human-AI collaboration, advanced General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) agents are endowed with the capability to emerge and establish social connections with users by exhibiting human-like features. This study endeavors to enhance the existing research concerning the mechanism of human-AI interaction from a socio-technical perspective and aims to offer insights for the design of GAIs within the framework of Human-Centered AI (HCAI) principles. [Method/process] In this study, we collected 1275 posts of user conversations with ChatGPT from the Douban community. Following the constructivist paradigm, we constructed a conceptual framework informed by the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm and mind perception theory, using a systematic thematic analysis approach. [Result/conclusion] This study presents a theoretical model portraying GAI as social actors, elucidating users’ mind perceptions and social responses during human-AI interactions. The perceptions of GAI encompass both agency and experience dimensions, mutually influencing each other. GAI agency perception comprises dimensions such as creativity, reliability, running rules, objectivity, and utility. Meanwhile, GAI experience perception includes empathy, communication responsibility, fun, friendliness, and cultural adaptability. Social responses involve cognitive, emotional, and behavioral dimensions. Cognitive processing encompasses knowledge acquisition and attitude change. Emotional arousal includes pleasure, resonance, and social connection. Behavioral reinforcement includes sustained paying behavior and para-social interaction. Notably, a bidirectional relationship exists between users’ social responses and their perceptions of GAI. © 2024 Information studies: Theory and Application. All rights reserved.

AB  - Health promoting university is a holistic approach to health that uses higher education settings to create a learning environment that improves the health and well-being of the campus community in a sustainable manner. The utilization of technology such as artificial intelligence (AI) could be one of the main success factors in the implementation of health-promoting universities to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of all stages of activities carried out in health promotion and prevention efforts. Integrated monitoring with the utilization of AI in this program is conducted to evaluate the health status of the students. The Syiah Kuala Integrated Medical Monitoring (SKIMM) has three components of continuous health status evaluation: vital signs, nutritional status, and burnout status. Health status monitoring was conducted continuously for three months among medical students at the Faculty of Medicine Universitas Syiah Kuala, Banda Aceh, Indonesia. This system uses the WhatsApp application as a platform to monitor health status. Student health monitoring in this program consists of two main activities: the health measurement phase and the health monitoring phase. The use of the SKIMM system to monitor students' vital signs, nutritional status and burnout status through the use of AI significantly raises students' awareness to conduct timely self-examination and enables sustainable healthy lifestyle behavior change. The adoption of AI technology allows for continuous health promotion to the entire academic community, including students in implementing the health promoting university. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Exposure to diverse perspectives is helpful for bursting the filter bubble in online public video platforms. The recent advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) illuminates the potential of creating a debate chatbot that prompts users to critically examine their stances on a topic formed by watching videos. However, whether the viewer is influenced by the chatbot may depend on its persona. In this paper, we investigated the effect of two relevant persona attributes - social identity and rhetorical styles - on critical thinking. In a mixed-methods study (n=36), we found that chatbots with outgroup (vs. ingroup) identity (t(33)=-2.33, p=0.03) and persuasive (vs. eristic) rhetoric (t(44)=1.98, p=0.05) induced critical thinking most effectively, making participants re-examine their arguments. However, participants' stances remain largely unaffected, likely due to the chatbot's lack of contextual knowledge and human touch. Our paper provides empirical groundwork for designing chatbot persona for remedying filter bubbles in online communities. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Objectives: To identify studies promoting the use of artificial intelligence (AI) or automation with HIV preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) care and explore ways for AI to be used in PrEP interventions. Design: Systematic review. Methods: We searched in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Research Synthesis database through November 2023; PROSPERO (CRD42023458870). We included studies published in English that reported using AI or automation in PrEP interventions. Two reviewers independently reviewed the full text and extracted data by using standard forms. Risk of bias was assessed using either the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials for randomized controlled trials or an adapted Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale for nonrandomized studies. Results: Our search identified 12 intervention studies (i.e., interventions that used AI/automation to improve PrEP care). Currently available intervention studies showed AI/automation interventions were acceptable and feasible in PrEP care while improving PrEP-related outcomes (i.e., knowledge, uptake, adherence, discussion with care providers). These interventions have used AI/automation to reduce workload (e.g., directly observed therapy) and helped non-HIV specialists prescribe PrEP with AI-generated clinical decision-support. Automated tools can also be developed with limited budget and staff experience. Conclusions: AI and automation have high potential to improve PrEP care. Despite limitations of included studies (e.g., the small sample sizes and lack of rigorous study design), our review suggests that by using aspects of AI and automation appropriately and wisely, these technologies may accelerate PrEP use and reduce HIV infection.

AB  - The mental-health app Woebot launched in 2017, back when 'chatbot' wasn't a familiar term and someone seeking a therapist could only imagine talking to a human being. Woebot was something exciting and new: a way for people to get on-demand mental-health support in the form of a responsive, empathic, AI-powered chatbot. Users found that the friendly robot avatar checked in on them every day, kept track of their progress, and was always available to talk something through. ¶ Today, the situation is vastly different. Demand for mental-health services has surged while the supply of clinicians has stagnated. There are thousands of apps that offer automated support for mental health and wellness. And ChatGPT has helped millions of people experiment with conversational AI. ¶ But even as the world has become fascinated with generative AI, people have also seen its downsides. As a company that relies on conversation, Woebot Health had to decide whether generative AI could make Woebot a better tool, or whether the technology was too dangerous to incorporate into our product. ¶ Woebot is designed to have structured conversations through which it delivers evidence-based tools inspired by cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a technique that aims to change behaviors and feelings. Throughout its history, Woebot Health has used technology from a subdiscipline of AI known as natural-language processing (NLP). The company has used AI artfully and by design-Woebot uses NLP only in the service of better understanding a user's written texts so it can respond in the most appropriate way, thus encouraging users to engage more deeply with the process.  © 1964-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Chatbots can effect large-scale behaviour change because they are accessible through social media, flexible, scalable, and gather data automatically. Yet research on the feasibility and effectiveness of chatbot-administered behaviour change interventions is sparse. The effectiveness of established behaviour change interventions when implemented in chatbots is not guaranteed, given the unique human–machine interaction dynamics. We pilot-tested chatbot-based behaviour change through information provision and embedded animations. We evaluated whether the chatbot could increase understanding and intentions to adopt protective behaviours during the pandemic. Fifty-nine culturally and linguistically diverse participants received a compassion intervention, an exponential growth intervention, or no intervention. We measured participants’ COVID-19 testing intentions and measured their staying-home attitudes before and after their chatbot interaction. We found reduced uncertainty about protective behaviours. The exponential growth intervention increased participants’ testing intentions. This study provides preliminary evidence that chatbots can spark behaviour change, with applications in diverse and underrepresented groups. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Patient outcomes in ophthalmology are greatly influenced by adherence and patient participation, which can be particularly challenging in diseases like glaucoma, where medication regimens can be complex. A well-studied and evidence-based intervention for behavioral change is motivational interviewing (MI), a collaborative and patient-centered counseling approach that has been shown to improve medication adherence in glaucoma patients. However, there are many barriers to clinicians being able to provide motivational interviewing in-office, including short visit durations within high-volume ophthalmology clinics and inadequate billing structures for counseling. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs), a type of artificial intelligence, have advanced such that they can follow instructions and carry coherent conversations, offering novel solutions to a wide range of clinical problems. In this paper, we discuss the potential of LLMs to provide chatbot-driven MI to improve adherence in glaucoma patients and provide an example conversation as a proof of concept. We discuss the advantages of AI-driven MI, such as demonstrated effectiveness, scalability, and accessibility. We also explore the risks and limitations, including issues of safety and privacy, as well as the factual inaccuracies and hallucinations to which LLMs are susceptible. Domain-specific training may be needed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of information provided in subspecialty areas such as glaucoma. Despite the current limitations, AI-driven motivational interviewing has the potential to offer significant improvements in adherence and should be further explored to maximally leverage the potential of artificial intelligence for our patients.  © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - The continuous development of the Internet and the continuous changes in digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain technology, and AIGC technology mean that digital technology is the direction of future urban development. With the development and progress of society, problems such as environmental damage, lax regulatory systems, and low enthusiasm of people to protect the environment frequently occur. The quality of the global environment and social development develop in inverse proportion. As one of the key technologies for the development of future digital cities, blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, openness, non-tamperability, traceability, and incentivization, which can meet the public's openness and incentives for ecological and environmental protection behaviors. change. Use the 'incentive mechanism' and 'distributed ledger' technologies in the blockchain to improve the public's behavioral enthusiasm for protecting the ecological environment and the standardization of resource utilization, and ensure the authenticity and real-name nature of the data obtained from participating in ecological protection activities. Fundamentally implement technology and ecological environmental protection measures to promote the construction of ecological civilization in the digital era. © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - While the use of machine learning for the detection of propaganda techniques in text has garnered considerable attention, most approaches focus on “black-box” solutions with opaque inner workings. Interpretable approaches provide a solution, however, they depend on careful feature engineering and costly expert annotated data. Additionally, language features specific to propagandistic text are generally the focus of rhetoricians or linguists, and there is no data set labeled with such features suitable for machine learning. This study codifies 22 rhetorical and linguistic features identified in literature related to the language of persuasion for the purpose of annotating an existing data set labeled with propaganda techniques. To help human experts annotate natural language sentences with these features, RhetAnn, a web application, was specifically designed to minimize an otherwise considerable mental effort. Finally, a small set of annotated data was used to fine-tune GPT-3.5, a generative large language model (LLM), to annotate the remaining data while optimizing for financial cost and classification accuracy. This study demonstrates how combining a small number of human annotated examples with GPT can be an effective strategy for scaling the annotation process at a fraction of the cost of traditional annotation relying solely on human experts. The results are on par with the best performing model at the time of writing, namely GPT-4, at 10x less the cost. Our contribution is a set of features, their properties, definitions, and examples in a machine-readable format, along with the code for RhetAnn and the GPT prompts and fine-tuning procedures for advancing state-of-the-art interpretable propaganda technique detection. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - This article examines the emerging marketing tactic of artificial intelligence (AI) ingratiation of humans and reveals that AI ingratiation leads to increased consumer acceptance of product recommendations. The positive effect of ingratiation is explained by consumers’ self-enhancing motivations to believe that AI’s ingratiating comments are particularly accurate and objective. Moreover, these ingratiation effects are moderated by the extent to which AI is anthropomorphized. Counter to the literature showing benefits of anthropomorphism and consistent with the persuasion knowledge model, consumers perceive ingratiation by humanlike (vs. machinelike) AI systems to be more driven by ulterior motives, thereby activating consumer defense mechanisms against ingratiation attempts. Our theory and findings elucidate how AI design features serve to strengthen or weaken consumer resistance to persuasion. We discuss the implications of our findings for the development and ethical utilization of the sophisticated conversational AI that are fast emerging in various marketing contexts. © 2024 Association for Consumer Research.

AB  - Purpose of reviewIn recent years, there has been a burgeoning interest in using machine learning methods. This has been accompanied by an expansion in the availability and ease of use of machine learning tools and an increase in the number of large, complex datasets which are suited to machine learning approaches. This review summarizes recent work in the field and sets expectations for its impact in the future.Recent findingsMuch work has focused on establishing good practices and ethical frameworks to guide the use of machine learning in research. Machine learning has an established role in identifying features in 'omics' research and is emerging as a tool to generate predictive models to identify people at risk of disease and patients at risk of complications. They have been used to identify risks for malnutrition and obesity. Machine learning techniques have also been used to develop smartphone apps to track behaviour and provide healthcare advice.SummaryMachine learning techniques are reaching maturity and their impact on observational data analysis and behaviour change will come to fruition in the next 5 years. A set of standards and best practices are emerging and should be implemented by researchers and publishers. Copyright © 2024 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - For artificial intelligence (AI) to support nutrition care, high quality and accuracy of its features within smartphone applications (apps) are essential. This study evaluated popular apps’ features, quality, behaviour change potential, and comparative validity of dietary assessment via manual logging and AI. The top 200 free and paid nutrition-related apps from Australia’s Apple App and Google Play stores were screened (n = 800). Apps were assessed using MARS (quality) and ABACUS (behaviour change potential). Nutritional outputs from manual food logging and AI-enabled food-image recognition apps were compared with food records for Western, Asian, and Recommended diets. Among 18 apps, Noom scored highest on MARS (mean = 4.44) and ABACUS (21/21). From 16 manual food-logging apps, energy was overestimated for Western (mean: 1040 kJ) but underestimated for Asian (mean: −1520 kJ) diets. MyFitnessPal and Fastic had the highest accuracy (97% and 92%, respectively) out of seven AI-enabled food image recognition apps. Apps with more AI integration demonstrated better functionality, but automatic energy estimations from AI-enabled food image recognition were inaccurate. To enhance the integration of apps into nutrition care, collaborating with dietitians is essential for improving their credibility and comparative validity by expanding food databases. Moreover, training AI models are needed to improve AI-enabled food recognition, especially for mixed dishes and culturally diverse foods. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Using chatbots to make recommendations is increasingly popular. The design of recommendation chatbots has mainly been taking an information-centric approach by focusing on the recommended content per se. Limited attention is on how social connection and relational strategies, such as self-disclosure from a chatbot, may influence users' perception and acceptance of the recommendation. In this work, we designed, implemented, and evaluated a social chatbot capable of performing three different levels of self-disclosure: factual information (low), cognitive opinions (medium), and emotions (high). In the evaluation, we recruited 372 participants to converse with the chatbot on two topics: movies and COVID-19 experiences. In each topic, the chatbot conducted small talks and made relevant recommendations to the topic. Participants were randomly assigned to four experimental conditions where the chatbot used factual, cognitive, emotional, and adaptive strategies to perform self-disclosures. By training a text classifier to identify users' level of self-disclosure in real-time, the adaptive chatbot can dynamically match its self-disclosure language to the level of disclosure exhibited by the users. Our results show that users reciprocate with higher-level self-disclosure when a recommendation chatbot displays emotions throughout the conversation. The utilization of emotional disclosure by the chatbot resulted in enhanced enjoyment during interactions and a more favorable perception of the bot. This, in turn, led to greater effectiveness in making recommendations, including a higher likelihood of accepting the recommendation. We discuss the understandings obtained and implications to future design. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Publication rights licensed to ACM.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe how people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) make decisions using the diffusion of innovation theory model. Decisions occur when individual decision makers engage in activities that guide choices to adopt or reject a particular innovation. METHODS: This is a descriptive analysis research using a survey method. Data collection was carried out using a decision making questionnaire. The subjects in this research were HIV/AIDS sufferers (PLWHA) who lived in Turen, Indonesia. The number of research subjects was 36 respondents obtained using the purposive sampling technique on January 2023. RESULTS: The research design used the correlation method with a cross sectional approach and the Spearman correlation coefficient statistical test. The research results show significance (2-tailed) of 0.934 (p>0.05). The correlation coefficient results are negative. Where the direction of the correlation produces showed a very weak relationship with a value of 0.014 and the results of the analysis between variables are not the same. This is because the persuasion stage was not tested in the analysis. Research shows that 8 (22.2%) patients rejected the decision making of PLWHA using the diffusion of innovation theory model at the Western Provident Association Turen Foundation, Turen, Indonesia, while 28 (77.7%) patients accepted it. It can be concluded that the majority of decisions made by HIV/AIDS patients at the ADIS Turen Peduli Warga Foundation are accepted. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of HIV/AIDS sufferers is at a good level, their decision making is mostly accepted and there is a meaningful relationship between knowledge and decision making in using a chatbot innovation. The suggestion from the research is that this chatbot innovation can be a source of further research and help provide education for PLWHA patients in everyday life.

AB  - Introduction: Evidence supporting the use of apps for lifestyle behavior change and diabetes prevention in people at high risk of diabetes is lacking. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the acceptability and effectiveness of smartphone applications (apps) for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. Methods: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and PsychInfo were searched from 2008 to 2023. Included studies involved adults at high risk of developing diabetes evaluating an app intervention with the aim of preventing type 2 diabetes. Random-effects meta-analyses were conducted for weight loss, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin, and waist circumference. Narrative synthesis was conducted for all studies, including qualitative studies exploring user perspectives. Results: Twenty-four studies (n=2,378) were included in this systematic review, including 9 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with an average duration of 6 months, 10 quasi-experimental and 7 qualitative studies. Socially disadvantaged groups were poorly represented. Six RCTs were combined in meta-analyses. Apps were effective at promoting weight loss [mean difference (MD) −1.85; 95% CI −2.90 to −0.80] and decreasing BMI [MD −0.90, 95% CI −1.53 to −0.27], with no effect on glycated hemoglobin and waist circumference. No studies reported on diabetes incidence. Qualitative studies highlighted the need for app personalization. Discussion: Smartphone apps have a promising effect on preventing type 2 diabetes by supporting weight loss. Future robust trials should include diverse populations in co-design and evaluation of apps and explore the role of artificial intelligence in further personalizing interventions for higher engagement and effectiveness. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - To assess the current real-world applications of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) as functionality of digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) that influence patient or consumer health behaviors. A scoping review was done across the EMBASE, PsycInfo, PsycNet, PubMed, and Web of Science databases using search terms related to ML/AI, behavioral science, and digital health to find live DBCIs using ML or AI to influence real-world health behaviors in patients or consumers. A total of 32 articles met inclusion criteria. Evidence regarding behavioral domains, target real-world behaviors, and type and purpose of ML and AI used were extracted. The types and quality of research evaluations done on the DBCIs and limitations of the research were also reviewed. Research occurred between October 9, 2023, and January 20, 2024. Twenty-three DBCIs used AI to influence real-world health behaviors. Most common domains were cardiometabolic health (n=5, 21.7%) and lifestyle interventions (n=4, 17.4%). The most common types of ML and AI used were classical ML algorithms (n=10, 43.5%), reinforcement learning (n=8, 34.8%), natural language understanding (n=8, 34.8%), and conversational AI (n=5, 21.7%). Evidence was generally positive, but had limitations such as inability to detect causation, low generalizability, or insufficient study duration to understand long-term outcomes. Despite evidence gaps related to the novelty of the technology, research supports the promise of using AI in DBCIs to manage complex input data and offer personalized, contextualized support for people changing real-world behaviors. Key opportunities are standardizing terminology and improving understanding of what ML and AI are. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Traditionally, users have perceived that only manual laborers or those in repetitive jobs would be subject to technological substitution. However, with the emergence of technologies like Midjourney, ChatGPT, and Notion AI, known as Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), we have come to realize that cognitive laborers, particularly creative designers, also face similar professional challenges. Yet, there has been relatively little research analyzing the acceptance and trust of artificial intelligence from the perspective of designers. This study integrates the TAM/TPB behavioral measurement model, incorporating intrinsic characteristics of designers, to delineate their perceived risks of AIGC into functional and emotional dimensions. It explores how these perceived characteristics, risks, and trust influence designers’ behavioral intentions, employing structural equation modeling for validation. The findings reveal the following: (1) designer trust is the primary factor influencing their behavioral choices; (2) different dimensions of perceived risks have varying degrees of impact on trust, with functional risks significantly positively affecting trust compared to emotional risks; (3) only by enhancing the transparency and credibility of Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC) can the perceived characteristics of designers be elevated; and (4) only by effectively safeguarding designers’ legitimate rights and interests can perceived risks be significantly reduced, thereby enhancing trust and subsequently prompting actual behavioral intentions. This study not only enhances the applicability and suitability of AIGC across various industries but also provides evidence for the feasibility of intelligent design in the creative design industry, facilitating the transition of AIGC to Artificial Intelligence-Generated Design (AIGD) for industrial upgrading. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Problematic smartphone use negatively affects physical and mental health. Despite the wide range of prior research, existing persuasive techniques are not flexible enough to provide dynamic persuasion content based on users' physical contexts and mental states. We first conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study (N=12) and an interview study (N=10) to summarize the mental states behind problematic smartphone use: boredom, stress, and inertia. This informs our design of four persuasion strategies: understanding, comforting, evoking, and scaffolding habits. We leveraged large language models (LLMs) to enable the automatic and dynamic generation of effective persuasion content. We developed MindShift, a novel LLM-powered problematic smartphone use intervention technique. MindShift takes users' in-the-moment app usage behaviors, physical contexts, mental states, goals & habits as input, and generates personalized and dynamic persuasive content with appropriate persuasion strategies. We conducted a 5-week field experiment (N=25) to compare MindShift with its simplified version (remove mental states) and baseline techniques (fixed reminder). The results show that MindShift improves intervention acceptance rates by 4.7-22.5% and reduces smartphone usage duration by 7.4-9.8%. Moreover, users have a significant drop in smartphone addiction scale scores and a rise in self-efficacy scale scores. Our study sheds light on the potential of leveraging LLMs for context-aware persuasion in other behavior change domains. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Interactive decision aids (IDAs) on websites often require users to disclose relevant information (e.g., preferences, contact information) to help users in making decisions (e.g., product choice). With technological advances in IDAs, websites increasingly switch from static, non-conversational IDAs (e.g., web forms) to conversational ones (e.g., chatbots) to boost user information disclosure that nurtures the websites' economic viability. While this novel form of IDAs is already widely employed in practice, information systems research has yet to examine the defining dialogue design features of conversational IDAs and their effects on eliciting user information. Drawing on persuasion theory and particularly on consistency and reciprocity as influence techniques, we develop a research model around two crucial dialogue design features of conversational IDAs. Specifically, we investigate the distinct and joint effects of conversational style (i.e., absence vs. presence of a conversational presentation of requests) and reciprocation triggers (i.e., absence vs. presence of reciprocity-inducing information) on user information disclosure (i.e., email addresses). By combining the complementary properties of a randomised field experiment (N = 386) and a follow-up online experiment (N = 182), we empirically provide evidence in support of the distinct and joint effects of conversational style and reciprocation triggers of IDAs on user information disclosure. Moreover, we demonstrate that these dialogue design features have indirect effects on information disclosure via perceptions of social presence and privacy concerns. Thus, our paper provides theoretical and practical insights into whether, how, and why critical IDA dialogue design features can better elicit user information for website services. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigates the effectiveness of Voice User Interfaces (VUIs) in supporting mindfulness techniques for smoking cessation. We conducted a month-long between-subject study involving nine participants, comparing a VUI on smart speakers against an augmented VUI (a blend of VUI and Graphical User Interface) on mobile devices. Specifically, we evaluated how these interfaces support individuals in quitting smoking through mindfulness practices. Our results include qualitative insights on participants' experiences with mindfulness, their smoking cessation motivation, and engagement with the VUI prototypes, alongside quantitative data on their usage patterns. Our findings offer insights into the potential application of VUIs in smoking cessation and suggest design guidelines for future health-oriented applications. The study underscores the importance of device context in designing effective health interventions and sets the direction for future work in HCI and mindfulness applications. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - News media framing can shape public perception and potentially polarize views. Emotional language can exacerbate these framing effects, as a user's emotional state can be an important contextual factor to use in news recommendation. Our research explores the relation between emotional framing techniques and the emotional states of readers, as well as readers' perceived trust in specific news articles. Users (N = 200) had to read three economic news articles from the Washington Post. We used ChatGPT-4 to reframe news articles with specific emotional languages (Anger, Fear, Hope), compared to a neutral baseline reframed by a human journalist. Our results revealed that negative framing (Anger, Fear) elicited stronger negative emotional states among users than the neutral baseline, while Hope led to little changes overall. In contrast, perceived trust levels varied little across the different conditions. We discuss the implications of our findings and how emotional framing could affect societal polarization issues. © 2024 Owner/Author.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare security. Informal agents in healthcare are used to promote and prevent health, as well as to interact |with other new technologies to give patients with in-home care. Because of the increased demand for health services and the expanding potential of AI, informal agents have been developed to assist a number of health-related tasks, such as behavior modification, treatment support and services, and health monitoring support. Chatbots powered by artificial intelligence may serve as conversational agents capable of improving health, delivering information, and possibly effecting behavior change. To foresee their acceptability, it is vital to analyze the motivation for employing health chatbots. The computerization of these activities might allow doctors to put a spotlight on extra tricky responsibilities even as mounting community admission to healthcare services. Assembling the facts, a full appraisal of the suitability, worth, and effectiveness of these causes in healthcare is necessary. Future research may then concentrate on areas for improvement and the prospect of long-term adoption. The reason of this research was to see whether people were willing to communicate with Al-powered health chatbots. Objective: The purpose of this thorough research is to assess the efficacy and usability of Al-powered conversational bots in healthcare security. © 2024 Scrivener Publishing LLC.

AB  - Recommendation systems are gaining popularity on Internet platforms such as Amazon, Netflix, Spotify or Booking. As more users are joining these online consumer and entertainment sectors, the profile-based data for providing accurate just-in-time recommendations is rising thanks to strategies based on collaborative filtering or content-based metrics. However, these systems merely focus on providing the right item for the users without taking into account what would be the best strategy to suggest the movie, the product or the song (i.e. the strategy to increase the success or impact of the recommendation). Taking this research gap into consideration, this paper proposes a profile-based recommendation system that outputs a set of potential persuasive strategies that can be used with users with similar characteristics. The case study presented provides tailored persuasive strategies to make office-based employees enhance the energy efficiency at work (the dataset used on this research is specific of this sector). Throughout the paper, shreds of evidence are reported assessing the validity of the proposed system. Specifically, two approaches are compared: a profile-based recommendation system (RS) vs. the same RS enriched by adding an ensemble with an active learning model. The results shed light on not only providing effective mechanisms to increase the success of the recommendations but also alleviating the cold start problem when newcomers arrive. © Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2020.

AB  - There has been a growing interest in Explainable Artificial Intelligence (henceforth XAI) models among researchers and AI programmers in recent years. Indeed, the development of highly interactive technologies that can collaborate closely with users has made explainability a necessity. This intends to reduce mistrust and the sense of unpredictability that AI can create, especially among non-experts. Moreover, the potential of XAI as a valuable resource has been recognized, considering that it can make intelligent systems more user-friendly and reduce the negative impact of black box systems. Building on such considerations, the paper discusses the potential dangers of large language models (LLMs) that generate explanations to support the outcomes produced. While these models may give users the illusion of control over the system’s responses, they actually have persuasive and non-explanatory effects. Therefore, it is argued here that XAI, appropriately regulated, should be a resource to empower users of AI systems. Any other apparent explanations should be reported to avoid misleading and circumventing effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This paper introduces an approach developed for multimodal meme analysis, specifically targeting the identification of persuasion techniques embedded within memes. Our methodology integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) and contrastive learning image encoders to discern the presence of persuasive elements in memes across diverse platforms. By capitalizing on the contextual understanding facilitated by LLMs and the discriminative power of contrastive learning for image encoding, our framework provides a robust solution for detecting and classifying memes with persuasion techniques. The system was used in Task 4 of Semeval 2024, precisely for Substask 2b (binary classification of presence of persuasion techniques). It showed promising results overall, achieving a Macro-F1 = 0.7986 on the English test data (i.e., the language the system was trained on) and Macro-F1 = 0.66777/0.47917/0.5554, respectively, on the other three “surprise” languages proposed by the task organizers, i.e., Bulgarian, North Macedonian and Arabic. The paper provides an overview of the system, along with a discussion of the results obtained and its main limitations. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - As the popularity of AI continues to grow, the techniques used to train AI systems have become increasingly intriguing. Reinforcement learning (RL) in simulation environments provides a safe and effective training approach for AI. However, the performance of the communication protocol between the reinforcement learning system and the simulation environment significantly impacts the overall system performance. This research aims to investigate the impact of communication protocols on algorithmic fairness by exploring public opinion and persuasion. The test software uses reinforcement learning data of floating-point numbers and images to assess communication methods, including Sockets, Socket.IO, gRPC, and ZeroMQ. Results indicate that Sockets and ZeroMQ exhibit similar performance in transferring floats, while ZeroMQ outperforms Sockets when it comes to transmitting images. Sockets are preferred when dealing with larger datasets. ZeroMQ stands out due to its speed and user-friendly simplicity, making it a suitable choice for reinforcement learning in simulation, employing Unreal Engine, AGX Dynamics, and Stable Baselines3. In the conducted experiments, reinforcement learning is found to be the most time-consuming component, followed by simulation, with communication constituting half of the total time. As the complexity of the system increases, the time spent on reinforcement learning and simulation is expected to grow faster than that of communication, emphasizing the need to optimize other components. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Bharati Vidyapeeth's Institute of Computer Applications and Management 2023.

AB  - Nowadays, the spread of misinformation is a prominent problem in society. Our research focuses on aiding the automatic identification of misinformation by analyzing the persuasive strategies employed in textual documents. We introduce a novel annotation scheme encompassing common persuasive writing tactics to achieve our objective. Additionally, we provide a dataset on health misinformation, thoroughly annotated by experts utilizing our proposed scheme. Our contribution includes proposing a new task of annotating pieces of text with their persuasive writing strategy types. We evaluate fine-tuning and prompt-engineering techniques with pre-trained language models of the BERT family and the generative large language models of the GPT family using persuasive strategies as an additional source of information. We evaluate the effects of employing persuasive strategies as intermediate labels in the context of misinformation detection. Our results show that those strategies enhance accuracy and improve the explainability of misinformation detection models. The persuasive strategies can serve as valuable insights and explanations, enabling other models or even humans to make more informed decisions regarding the trustworthiness of the information. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown exceptional results on current benchmarks when working individually. The advancement in their capabilities, along with a reduction in parameter size and inference times, has facilitated the use of these models as agents, enabling interactions among multiple models to execute complex tasks. Such collaborations offer several advantages, including the use of specialized models (e.g. coding), improved confidence through multiple computations, and enhanced divergent thinking, leading to more diverse outputs. Thus, the collaborative use of language models is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. In this work, we evaluate the behavior of a network of models collaborating through debate under the influence of an adversary. We introduce pertinent metrics to assess the adversary's effectiveness, focusing on system accuracy and model agreement. Our findings highlight the importance of a model's persuasive ability in influencing others. Additionally, we explore inference-time methods to generate more compelling arguments and evaluate the potential of prompt-based mitigation as a defensive strategy. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Persuasion plays a pivotal role in a wide range of applications from health intervention to the promotion of social good. Persuasive chatbots employed responsibly for social good can be an enabler of positive individual and social change. Existing methods rely on fine-tuning persuasive chatbots with task-specific training data which is costly, if not infeasible, to collect. Furthermore, they employ only a handful of pre-defined persuasion strategies. We propose PersuaBot, a zero-shot chatbot based on Large Language Models (LLMs) that is factual and more persuasive by leveraging many more nuanced strategies. PersuaBot uses an LLM to first generate natural responses, from which the strategies used are extracted. To combat hallucination of LLMs, Persuabot replace any unsubstantiated claims in the response with retrieved facts supporting the extracted strategies. We applied our chatbot, PersuaBot, to three significantly different domains needing persuasion skills: donation solicitation, recommendations, and health intervention. Our experiments on simulated and human conversations show that our zero-shot approach is more persuasive than prior work, while achieving factual accuracy surpassing state-of-the-art knowledge-oriented chatbots. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Data augmentation comprises a set of techniques that are used to improve the performance of machine learning models. In the Natural Language Processing (NLP) field, the discrete nature of language represents a challenge to data augmentation, as text can lose coherence or syntactic accuracy during the augmentation process. This challenge is particularly pronounced in persuasive dialog systems, where high-quality data is crucial and scarce due to privacy regulations. In this study, we investigate the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance persuasive arguments from an Automatic Persuasive System (APS). Using a limited COVID-19 dialogue dataset of user-machine persuasive interactions, our goal is to evaluate the efficacy of different augmentation techniques, combined with LLMs, in generating syntactically coherent and accurate dialogues, with a specific emphasis on dialogue quality and persuasiveness. The results show that integrating LLMs with augmentation generates realistic and diverse examples, aiding the overall quality and effectiveness of the persuasive dialogues produced by the system. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - The market-driven trajectory of current trends in AI combined with emerging technologies and thresholds of performance being crossed create a subset of new and novel risks relating to human bias and cognition at scale. Though the topic of AI Ethics and risk has been discussed increasingly over the past few years, popular talking points and buzzwords have been used adversarially to steer the conversation with increasing success. This has left a subset of risks in the blind spot of most discussions, risks which have now become both urgent and imminent. Automation is actively seeking to replace not only human cognitive bias, but higher human cognition, with a weaker, but fast and scalable version of cognitive bias using stochastic parrots like Large Language Models. These models are, in effect, adversarially trained against humans, generally with the goal of “persuasion”, or manipulation, and each is guided by a corporately curated set of poorly aligned biases. This paper discusses these dynamics and the predictable repercussions of allowing closed information ecosystems to form under the influence of corporately curated and adversarially trained cognitive bias. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Can large language models, a form of artificial intelligence (AI), generate persuasive propaganda? We conducted a preregistered survey experiment of US respondents to investigate the persuasiveness of news articles written by foreign propagandists compared to content generated by GPT-3 davinci (a large language model). We found that GPT-3 can create highly persuasive text as measured by participants’ agreement with propaganda theses. We further investigated whether a person fluent in English could improve propaganda persuasiveness. Editing the prompt fed to GPT-3 and/or curating GPT-3’s output made GPT-3 even more persuasive, and, under certain conditions, as persuasive as the original propaganda. Our findings suggest that propagandists could use AI to create convincing content with limited effort. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The current corpus of evidence-based information for chronic disease prevention and treatment is vast and growing rapidly. Behavior change theories are increasingly more powerful but difficult to operationalize in the current healthcare system. Millions of Canadians are unable to access personalized preventive and behavior change care because our in-person model of care is running at full capacity and is not set up for mass education and behavior change programs. We propose a framework to utilize data from electronic medical records to identify patients at risk of developing chronic disease and reach out to them using digital health tools that are overseen by the primary care team. The framework leverages emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, digital health tools, and patient-generated data to deliver evidence-based knowledge and behavior change to patients across Canada at scale. The framework is flexible to enable new technologies to be added without overwhelming providers, patients or implementers.  © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigates the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) in producing routine, negative, and persuasive business emails for educational purposes within the context of Business Writing. Specifically, it compares the outputs generated by four widely-used LLMs (ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 2, Bing Chat, and Bard) when presented with identical email scenarios. These generated emails are evaluated using an elaborate rubric, allowing for a systematic assessment of LLMs' performance across three distinct email types. The results of the study show that the output with the same prompt varies greatly despite the rather formulaic nature of business emails. For instance, some LLMs struggle with following the requested structure and maintaining consistency in tone, while others have issues with unity and conciseness. The findings of this research hold implications for teaching business writing (rubrics, task instructions, in-class implementation), as well as for the integration of AI in professional communication at large. © 2024 Sciedu Press.

AB  - Distorted science communication harms individuals and society as it can lead to unhealthy behavior changes and decrease trust in scientific institutions. Given the rapidly increasing volume of science communication in recent years, a fine-grained understanding of how findings from scientific publications are reported to the general public, and methods to detect distortions from the original work automatically, are crucial. Prior work focused on individual aspects of distortions or worked with unpaired data. In this work, we make three foundational contributions towards addressing this problem: (1) annotating 1,600 instances of scientific findings from academic papers paired with corresponding findings as reported in news articles and tweets with respect to four characteristics: causality, certainty, generality and sensationalism; (2) establishing baselines for automatically detecting these characteristics; and (3) analyzing the prevalence of changes in these characteristics in both human-annotated and large-scale unlabeled data. Our results show that scientific findings frequently undergo subtle distortions when reported. Tweets distort findings more often than science news reports. Detecting fine-grained distortions automatically poses a challenging task. In our experiments, fine-tuned task-specific models consistently outperform few-shot Large Language Model prompting.

AB  - Parents today have a particularly hard time empathising with their children' worries, and teenagers themselves are having trouble finding solutions. To become a better version of themselves, everyone needs counsel. The most important part of being human is having mental support, which is especially important during adolescence when a person starts to feel a variety of emotions and his or her parents are itself new to that and have to deal with it. So, we are talking about this issue in this paper to discover answers and give advice to both parents and children using a chatbot. The dataset is gathered by examining teen behavior changes, and the system is trained using NLP and cosine similarity.  © 2024 E3S Web of Conferences

AB  - This paper examines the use of text message (SMS) interventions for health-related behavioral support. It first outlines the historical progress in SMS intervention research publications and the variety of funds from US government agencies. A narrative review follows, highlighting the effectiveness of SMS interventions in key health areas, such as physical activity, diet and weight loss, mental health, and substance use, based on published meta-analyses. It then outlines advantages of text messaging compared to other digital modalities, including the real-time capability to collect information and deliver microdoses of intervention support. Crucial design elements are proposed to optimize effectiveness and longitudinal engagement across communication strategies, psychological foundations, and behavior change tactics. We then discuss advanced functionalities, such as the potential for generative artificial intelligence to improve user interaction. Finally, major challenges to implementation are highlighted, including the absence of a dedicated commercial platform, privacy and security concerns with SMS technology, difficulties integrating SMS interventions with medical informatics systems, and concerns about user engagement. Proposed solutions aim to facilitate the broader application and effectiveness of SMS interventions. Our hope is that these insights can assist researchers and practitioners in using SMS interventions to improve health outcomes and reducing disparities. ©Brian Suffoletto.

AB  - This paper presents our approach to classifying hierarchically structured persuasion techniques used in memes for Task 4 Subtask 1 of SemEval 2024. We developed a custom classification head designed to be applied atop of a Large Language Model, reconstructing hierarchical relationships through multiple fully connected layers. This approach incorporates the decisions of foundational layers in subsequent, more fine-grained layers. To improve performance, we conducted a small hyperparameter search across various models and explored strategies for addressing uneven label distributions including weighted loss and thresholding methods. Furthermore, we extended our pre-processing to compete in the multilingual setup of the task by translating all documents into English. Finally, our system achieved third place on the English dataset and first place on the Bulgarian, North Macedonian and Arabic test datasets. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - This article explores the significance of Natural Interaction (NI) in the context of conversational assistants (CAs), aiming to model user dialogues through written and/or spoken language. By NI notion, we consider it is a grammar-free communication language as close as possible to human interaction through written and spoken language, and serves as a highly intuitive means of interaction. It eliminates the need for users to learn new commands, making tasks more accessible. This research addresses the question of which elements and constraints can be employed in crafting NI dialogues for CAs. The emergence of large language models (as ChatGPT) has transformed dialogue specification, reducing the role of producers and enabling users to configure and qualify dialogues based on their needs. The response’s quality and user understanding now depend on how well dialogues are specified. This study introduces a framework, DINA, to assist dialogue specifiers, even those without technical or linguistic expertise in AI, CAs, or Human-Computer Interaction, in describing assistant guidelines, dialogue benefits, and other essential attributes for effective NI. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have the potential to dramatically change the landscape of influence operations. They can generate persuasive, tailored content at scale, making campaigns using falsified content, such as disinformation and fake accounts, easier to produce. Advances in self-hosted open-source models have meant that adversaries can evade content moderation and security checks built into large commercial models such as those commercialised by Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI. New multi-lingual models make it easier than ever for foreign adversaries to pose as local actors. This article examines the heightened threats posed by synthetic media, as well as the potential that these tools hold for creating effective countermeasures. It begins with assessing the challenges posed by a toxic combination of automated bots, human-controlled troll accounts, and more targeted social engineering operations. However, the second part of the article assesses the potential for these same tools to improve detection. Promising countermeasures include running internal generative models to bolster training data for internal classifiers, detecting statistical anomalies, identifying output from common prompts, and building specialised classifiers optimised for specific monitoring needs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Efforts to scale up fact-checking through technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI), are increasingly being suggested and tested. This study examines whether previously observed effects of reading fact-checks remain constant when readers are aware of AI’s involvement in the fact-checking process. We conducted three online experiments (N = 3,978), exposing participants to fact-checks identified as either human-generated or AI-assisted, simulating cases where AI fully generates the fact-check or automatically retrieves human fact-checks. Our findings indicate that the persuasive effect of fact-checking, specifically in increasing truth discernment, persists even among participants without a positive prior attitude toward AI. Additionally, in some cases, awareness of AI’s role reduced perceived political bias in fact-checks among Republicans. Finally, neither AI-generated nor human fact-checks significantly affected participants’ feelings toward or their perceptions of the competence of the targeted politicians. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Affective artificial intelligence and multimodal sentiment analysis play critical roles in designing safe and effective human-computer interactions and are in diverse applications ranging from social chatbots to eldercare robots. However emotionally intelligent artificial intelligence can also manipulate, persuade, and otherwise compromise human autonomy. We face a constant stream of ever more capable models that can better understand nuanced, complex, and interrelated sentiments across different modalities including text, vision, and speech. This paper introduces MultiSentimentArcs, combination of an open and extensible multimodal sentiment analysis framework, a challenging movie dataset, and a novel benchmark. This enables the quantitative and qualitative identification, comparison, and prioritization of conflicting sentiments commonly arising from different models and modalities. Diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis is especially challenging in film narratives where actors, directors, cinematographers and editors use dialog, characters, and other elements in contradiction with each other to accentuate dramatic tension. MultiSentimentArcs uses local open-source software models to democratize artificial intelligence. We demonstrate how a simple 2-step pipeline of specialized open-source software with a large multimodal model followed by a large language model can approximate video sentiment analysis of a commercial state-of-the-art Claude 3 Opus. To the best of our knowledge, MultiSentimentArcs is the first fully open-source diachronic multimodal sentiment analysis framework, dataset, and benchmark to enable automatic or human-in-the-loop exploration, analysis, and critique of multimodal sentiment analysis on long-form narratives. We demonstrate two novel coherence metrics and a methodology to identify, quantify, and explain real-world sentiment models and modalities. MultiSentimentArcs integrates artificial intelligence with traditional narrative studies and related fields like film, linguistic and cultural studies. It also contributes to eXplainable artificial intelligence and artificial intelligence safety by enhancing artificial intelligence transparency in surfacing emotional persuasion, manipulation, and deception techniques. Finally, it can filter noisy emotional input and prioritize information rich channels to build more performant real-world human computer interface applications in fields like e-learning and medicine. This research contributes to the field of Digital Humanities by giving non-artificial intelligence experts access to directly engage in analysis and critique of research around affective artificial intelligence and human-AI alignment.

AB  - In this paper, we present a novel adaptive system architecture for positive health behavior change. Leveraging an advanced large language model as a knowledgebase, the system automatically generates personalized behavior change plans based on individual needs. It utilizes established health behavior change theories to provide timely, context-specific interventions and nudges. We outline the system's key components and functionality, demonstrating its adaptability through a structured walkthrough of”Achieve healthy weight” and”Manage Job-Related Stress” scenarios. We demonstrate that system dynamically adapts its recommendations based on users' evolving behaviors, intentions, circumstances, and stage in the behavior change process, ensuring ongoing relevance and effectiveness. The paper highlights the potential of a large language model to serve as a knowledge base in health behavior change support systems. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Psychological inoculation, a strategy to build resistance against persuasive misinformation, has been shown to reduce its spread and adverse effects. Although these inoculations are effective, the design and optimization of them typically require substantial financial and human resources. To address these challenges, this work introduces Simulated Misinformation Susceptibility Test (SMIST), leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate participant responses in misinformation studies. SMIST employs a life experience-driven simulation methodology, which accounts for various aspects of participants' backgrounds, to mitigate common issues of caricatures and stereotypes in LLM simulations and enhance response diversity. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that SMIST, utilizing GPT-4 as the backend model, yields results that align closely with those obtained from human-subject studies in misinformation susceptibility. This alignment suggests that LLMs can effectively serve as proxies in evaluating the impact of psychological inoculations. Further, SMIST can be applied to emerging and anticipated misinformation scenarios without harming human participants, thereby expanding the scope of misinformation research. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly with large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, have significantly enhanced dialogue systems, enabling them to generate more natural and fluent conversations. Despite these improvements, challenges persist, such as managing continuous dialogues, memory retention, and minimizing hallucinations. The AIWolfDial2024 addresses these challenges by employing the Werewolf Game, an incomplete information game, to test the capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive environments. This paper introduces a LLM-based Werewolf Game AI, where each role is supported by situation analysis to aid response generation. Additionally, for the werewolf role, various persuasion strategies, including logical appeal, credibility appeal, and emotional appeal, are employed to effectively persuade other players to align with its actions. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - The increasing availability of microtargeted advertising and the accessibility of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have raised concerns about the potential misuse of large language models in scaling microtargeting efforts for political purposes. Recent technological advancements, involving generative AI and personality inference from consumed text, can potentially create a highly scalable “manipulation machine” that targets individuals based on their unique vulnerabilities without requiring human input. This paper presents four studies examining the effectiveness of this putative “manipulation machine.” The results demonstrate that personalized political ads tailored to individuals’ personalities are more effective than nonpersonalized ads (studies 1a and 1b). Additionally, we showcase the feasibility of automatically generating and validating these personalized ads on a large scale (studies 2a and 2b). These findings highlight the potential risks of utilizing AI and microtargeting to craft political messages that resonate with individuals based on their personality traits. This should be an area of concern to ethicists and policy makers. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The contemporary food system within the European Union is characterised by significant sustainability and health challenges. This paper presents an innovative approach to address these issues by leveraging Citizen Science (CS) and Artificial Intelligence (AI). The study involved thirteen participants from Spain, France, and the USA who shared pictures of their food receipts over a month through WhatsApp. The receipts were analysed using optical character recognition (OCR) technology, and the data obtained was used to generate tailored nutritional and sustainable living recommendations through a Large Language Model (ChatGPT v4.0). The key objectives were to foster healthier and more environmentally friendly shopping habits and to engage consumers in a scientific process by making them active participants in data collection. The findings indicate that the integration of AI-generated advice can positively influence consumer behaviour towards more sustainable and healthy food choices. The study also assessed participant satisfaction with the AI recommendations and their self-perception in assigned consumer clusters, such as Health-Focused and Sustainability-Conscious. The majority of participants reported a high level of satisfaction with the intervention and agreed with their cluster assignment, indicating the potential of AI tools in consumer health and environmental education. This paper provides open access to the collected data and the methodologies used, to benefit the public and facilitate further research.  © 2024 University of Split, FESB.

AB  - Recent capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have transformed many tasks in Natural Language Processing (NLP), including question answering. The state-of-the-art systems do an excellent job of responding in a relevant, persuasive way but cannot guarantee factuality. Knowledge graphs, representing facts as triplets, can be valuable for avoiding errors and inconsistencies with real-world facts. This work introduces a knowledge graph-based approach to Turkish question answering. The proposed approach aims to develop a methodology capable of drawing inferences from a knowledge graph to answer complex multihop questions. We construct the Beyazperde Movie Knowledge Graph (BPMovieKG) and the Turkish Movie Question Answering dataset (TRMQA) to answer questions in the movie domain. We evaluate our proposed question answering pipeline against a baseline study. Furthermore, we compare it with a question answering system built upon GPT-3.5 Turbo to answer the 1-hop questions from TRMQA. The experimental results confirm that link prediction on a knowledge graph is quite effective in answering questions that require reasoning paths. Finally, we provide insights into the pros and cons of the provided solution through a qualitative study. © TÜBİTAK.

AB  - Based on recent technological advances, campaigners and political actors can use psychographic-based political marketing. Yet, empirical evidence about its effectiveness is still very limited. Based on self-congruity theory, a pre-registered experiment (N = 280) investigated the persuasion effects of personality-congruent political microtargeting on the attitude toward the political party and voting intentions of citizens. More precisely, the focus was on the thinking vs feeling personality dimension (MBTI), and it was tested whether this personality “interacts” with exposure to a matching advertising appeal: rational vs. emotional political ad. To do so, two different methodological approaches were used: 1) a machine learning approach; 2) a self-report survey measure of personality. Results revealed significant “congruence effects” between personality and ad appeal, and showed that perceived ad relevance was serving as the underlying mechanism (mediator). However, these results were only found when the self-report measure of personality was used. When the algorithmic approach was used, no significant results were found. These findings feed into timely societal, methodological, and theoretical contributions. © Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To fight misinformation, it is important to verify it, but also to ensure that true information reaches all those spaces that are likely to continue spreading hoaxes. To do this, it is necessary to generate reasoned, persuasive explanations adapted to each space and context. This project is the first to propose fighting misinformation through the automatic generation of explanatory arguments. To achieve this objective, it is necessary to create a tool that is capable of detecting where already debunked hoaxes are being replicated, deciding which is the most appropriate argumentative form to counteract it and, finally, generating the argument that can explain and persuade the spreader of the hoax or the users. For all this, an exhaustive study of the theory of argumentation is necessary, as well as the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Although argumentation has been studied in various contexts, there is no work to date that focuses on the analysis of the argumentation necessary for news verification. Taking advantage of the fact that much of the misinformation that spreads the most is usually verified by humans, in this work, we propose (i) generating a corpus of verifications paired with the disseminating messages associated to these, (ii) using existing theoretical frameworks to analyze the argumentation necessary to fight against misinformation, (iii) using cutting-edge techniques of language generation to explore this application, and finally (iv) exploring the impact that argumentative explanations can have in mitigating misinformation. In addition, we also want to study the use of NLP techniques as pre-bunking tools, which teach users how to detect misinformation. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Generating free-text rationales is among the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). These rationales have been found to enhance LLM performance across various NLP tasks. Recently, there has been growing interest in using these rationales to provide insights for various important downstream tasks. In this paper, we analyze generated free-text rationales in tasks with subjective answers, emphasizing the importance of rationalization in such scenarios. We focus on pairwise argument ranking, a highly subjective task with significant potential for real-world applications, such as debate assistance. We evaluate the persuasiveness of rationales generated by nine LLMs to support their subjective choices. Our findings suggest that open-source LLMs, particularly Llama2-70B-chat, are capable of providing highly persuasive rationalizations, surpassing even GPT models. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the persuasiveness of the generated rationales can be enhanced by guiding their persuasive elements through prompting or self-refinement techniques. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Social media platforms enable largely unrestricted many-to-many communication. In times of crisis, they offer a space for collective sense-making and give rise to new social phenomena (e.g., open-source investigations). However, they also serve as a tool for threat actors to conduct Cyber-enabled Social Influence Operations (CeSIOs) to shape public opinion and interfere in decision-making processes. CeSIOs employ sock puppet accounts to engage authentic users in online communication, exert influence, and subvert online discourse. Large Language Models (LLMs) may further enhance the deceptive properties of sock puppet accounts. Recent LLMs can generate targeted and persuasive text, which is, for the most part, indistinguishable from human-written content—ideal features for covert influence. This article reviews recent developments at the intersection of LLMs and influence operations, summarizes LLMs’ salience, and explores the potential impact of LLM-instrumented sock puppet accounts for CeSIOs. Finally, mitigation measures for the near future are highlighted. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The proposed expert opinion was prepared by a panel of obesity and law specialists from Turkey to review the utility of telemedicine in obesity care and to provide a guidance document with recommendations on a hybrid multidisciplinary integrated care follow-up algorithm and the legislation governing telemedicine practice to assist obesity specialists in practicing the telemedicine. Recent Findings: The efficacy and feasibility of telemedicine interventions in supporting obesity management programs even during pandemics confirm that obesity is a particularly well-suited field for telemedicine, emphasizing the strong likelihood of continued utilization of telemedicine in obesity management, beyond the pandemic period. Summary: Telemedicine has great potential to address several barriers to ongoing weight-management care, such as challenges of access to specialized care, cost, and time limitations as well as patient adherence to treatment. However, telemedicine practice should complement rather than replace the in-person visits which are unique in building rapport and offering social support. Accordingly, the participating experts recommend the use of a hybrid integrated care model in the management of obesity, with the use of telemedicine, as an adjunct to in-person visits, to enable the provision of suggested intensive obesity management via frequent visits by a multidisciplinary team of obesity specialists. Further research addressing the utility of telemedicine in terms of optimal modality and duration for successful long-term obesity management outcomes is necessary to develop specific guidelines on telemedicine practice. In addition, the legislation governing the norms and protocols on confidentiality, privacy, access, and liability needs to be improved. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) encapsulate vast amounts of knowledge but still remain vulnerable to external misinformation. Existing research mainly studied this susceptibility behavior in a single-turn setting. However, belief can change during a multi-turn conversation, especially a persuasive one. Therefore, in this study, we delve into LLMs' susceptibility to persuasive conversations, particularly on factual questions that they can answer correctly. We first curate the Farm (i.e., Fact to Misinform) dataset, which contains factual questions paired with systematically generated persuasive misinformation. Then, we develop a testing framework to track LLMs' belief changes in a persuasive dialogue. Through extensive experiments, we find that LLMs' correct beliefs on factual knowledge can be easily manipulated by various persuasive strategies. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - This project proposal explores the concept of human-machine symbiosis within conversational recommender systems (CRSs), aiming to develop CRSs that are more transparent, and persuasive and can better support users in decision-making tasks. One way to equip CRSs with these capabilities is by making use of the potential of large language models (LLMs). The research focuses on three main research directions: (1) integrating knowledge into LLMs to optimize their recommendation capabilities in CRSs; (2) exploring new ways to fine-tune a pre-trained model for conversational recommendations, without forgetting the knowledge it has already learned; (3) evaluating the impact of an LLM-based CRS on users in terms of transparency, engagement, and persuasion. Through this research, the aim is to overcome limitations in current CRS approaches and develop a more collaborative and user-centric recommendation system. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its author.

AB  - Argumentative essay generation (AEG) aims to generate complete texts on specific controversial topics or debates.Although current AEG methods can generate individual opinions, they often overlook the high-level connections between these opinions.This often leads to the generated results being mired in logical confusion, unable to proof their own arguments effectively.The generated essay may present evidence that contradicts the claims or they may fail to assemble the claims into logical flow.In this paper, we present a unified two-stage framework: Proof-Enhancement and Self-Annotation (PESA) for AEG with a focus on logical enhancement.Specifically, we first construct pseudo-labels for logical information,claims and grounds, using a large language model.We then propose a tree planning approach that introduces proof principles and ensures logical consistency.Extensive experimental results show that, benefiting from proof principle guidance, PESA generates argumentative essays with better logical validity and persuasiveness than strong baseline models. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - We study how differences in persuasive language across Wikipedia articles, written in either English and Russian, can uncover each culture’s distinct perspective on different subjects. We develop a large language model (LLM) powered system to identify instances of persuasive language in multilingual texts. Instead of directly prompting LLMs to detect persuasion, which is subjective and difficult, we propose to reframe the task to instead ask high-level questions (HLQs) which capture different persuasive aspects. Importantly, these HLQs are authored by LLMs themselves. LLMs over-generate a large set of HLQs, which are subsequently filtered to a small set aligned with human labels for the original task. We then apply our approach to a large-scale, bilingual dataset of Wikipedia articles (88K total), using a two-stage identify-then-extract prompting strategy to find instances of persuasion. We quantify the amount of persuasion per article, and explore the differences in persuasion through several experiments on the paired articles. Notably, we generate rankings of articles by persuasion in both languages. These rankings match our intuitions on the culturally-salient subjects; Russian Wikipedia highlights subjects on Ukraine, while English Wikipedia highlights the Middle East. Grouping subjects into larger topics, we find politically-related events contain more persuasion than others. We further demonstrate that HLQs obtain similar performance when posed in either English or Russian. Our methodology enables cross-lingual, cross-cultural understanding at scale, and we release our code, prompts, and data. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - The advent of generative Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has catalyzed transformative advancements across multiple domains. However, alongside these advancements, they have also introduced potential threats. One critical concern is the misuse of LLMs by disinformation spreaders, leveraging these models to generate highly persuasive yet misleading content that challenges the disinformation detection system. This work aims to address this issue by answering three research questions: (1) To what extent can the current disinformation detection technique reliably detect LLM-generated disinformation? (2) If traditional techniques prove less effective, can LLMs themself be exploited to serve as a robust defense against advanced disinformation? and, (3) Should both these strategies falter, what novel approaches can be proposed to counter this burgeoning threat effectively? A holistic exploration for the formation and detection of disinformation is conducted to foster this line of research. Copyright © 2024 by SIAM.

AB  - Background: Brief message interventions have demonstrated immense promise in health care, yet the development of these messages has suffered from a dearth of transparency and a scarcity of publicly accessible data sets. Moreover, the researcher-driven content creation process has raised resource allocation issues, necessitating a more efficient and transparent approach to content development. Objective: This research sets out to address the challenges of content development for SMS interventions by showcasing the use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for content creation, transparently explaining the prompt design and content generation process, and providing the largest publicly available data set of brief messages and source code for future replication of our process. Methods: Leveraging the pretrained large language model GPT-3.5 (OpenAI), we generate a collection of messages in the context of medication adherence for individuals with type 2 diabetes using evidence-derived behavior change techniques identified in a prior systematic review. We create an attributed prompt designed to adhere to content (readability and tone) and SMS (character count and encoder type) standards while encouraging message variability to reflect differences in behavior change techniques. Results: We deliver the most extensive repository of brief messages for a singular health care intervention and the first library of messages crafted with generative AI. In total, our method yields a data set comprising 1150 messages, with 89.91% (n=1034) meeting character length requirements and 80.7% (n=928) meeting readability requirements. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that all messages exhibit diversity comparable to an existing publicly available data set created under the same theoretical framework for a similar setting. Conclusions: This research provides a novel approach to content creation for health care interventions using state-of-the-art generative AI tools. Future research is needed to assess the generated content for ethical, safety, and research standards, as well as to determine whether the intervention is successful in improving the target behaviors. © Rachel M Harrison, Ekaterina Lapteva, Anton Bibin.

AB  - Introduction: Public health messaging is crucial for promoting beneficial health outcomes, and the latest advancements in artificial intelligence offer new opportunities in this field. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of ChatGPT-4 in generating pro-vaccine messages on different topics for Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. Methods: In this study (N = 60), we examined the persuasive effect of pro-vaccine messages generated by GPT-4 and humans, which were constructed based on 17 factors impacting HPV vaccination. Paired-samples t-tests were used to compare the persuasiveness of these messages. Results: GPT-generated messages were reported as more persuasive than human-generated messages on some influencing factors (e.g., untoward effect, stigmatized perception). Human-generated messages performed better on the message regarding convenience of vaccination. Discussion: This study provides evidence for the viability of ChatGPT, in generating persuasive pro-vaccine messages to influence people’s vaccine attitudes. It is indicated that the feasibility and efficiency of using AI for public health communication. Copyright © 2025 Xia, Song and Zhu.

AB  - This paper describes our system used in the SemEval-2024 Task 4 Multilingual Detection of Persuasion Techniques in Memes. Our team proposes a detection system that employs a Teacher Student Fusion framework. Initially, a Large Language Model serves as the teacher, engaging in abductive reasoning on multimodal inputs to generate background knowledge on persuasion techniques, assisting in the training of a smaller downstream model. The student model adopts CLIP as an encoder for text and image features, and we incorporate an attention mechanism for modality alignment. Ultimately, our proposed system achieves a Macro-F1 score of 0.8103, ranking 1st out of 20 on the leaderboard of Subtask 2b in English. In Bulgarian, Macedonian and Arabic, our detection capabilities are ranked 1/15, 3/15 and 14/15. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - In today's world, the development of social network services (SNS) like Facebook and Instagram has enabled consumers to acquire information about products through various channels. The acquisition of diverse information has led to a diversification in consumer preferences and requirements. As consumer preferences diversify and online channels expand, there is an increasing need for companies to provide personalized marketing. Among the means of personalized marketing, personalized marketing messages are a key tool that can enhance customer engagement. However, a limitation of personalized marketing message services is the cost issue associated with manually writing individual marketing messages for personalization. To solve this problem, when developing automated technology for personalized marketing messages, there were concerns about the complexity of model development and the quality of messages generated automatically. In this study, we propose the Persuasive Message Intelligence (PMI) service, which utilizes the recently prominent Large Language Model for automated individual personalized marketing messages. PMI generates marketing messages through prompt engineering based on the theory of persuasion in marketing and prior research on AI-generated messages, and validates the elements of prompts through surveys. The trial and error of researchers presented in this study, along with the know-how and rules of prompt engineering, will serve as guidelines for those who wish to develop services through prompts in the future.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Textual data from social platforms captures various aspects of mental health through discussions around and across issues, while users reach out for help and others sympathize and offer support. We propose a comprehensive framework that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Generative AI techniques to identify and assess mental health disorders, detect their severity, and create recommendations for behavior change and therapeutic interventions based on users' posts on Reddit. To classify the disorders, we use rule-based labeling methods as well as advanced pre-trained NLP models to extract nuanced semantic features from the data. We fine-tune domain-adapted and generic pre-trained NLP models based on predictions from specialized Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve classification accuracy. Our hybrid approach combines the generalization capabilities of pre-trained models with the domain-specific in-sights captured by LLMs, providing an improved understanding of mental health discourse. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of each model, offering valuable insights into their practical applicability. This research potentially facilitates early detection and personalized care to aid practitioners and aims to facilitate timely interventions and improve overall well-being, thereby contributing to the broader field of mental health surveillance and digital health analytics. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Common methods for aligning large language models (LLMs) with desired behaviour heavily rely on human-labelled data. However, as models grow increasingly sophisticated, they will surpass human expertise, and the role of human evaluation will evolve into non-experts overseeing experts. In anticipation of this, we ask: can weaker models assess the correctness of stronger models? We investigate this question in an analogous setting, where stronger models (experts) possess the necessary information to answer questions and weaker models (non-experts) lack this information but are otherwise as capable. The method we evaluate is debate, where two LLM experts each argue for a different answer, and a non-expert selects the answer. On the QuALITY comprehension task, we find that debate consistently helps both non-expert models and humans answer questions, achieving 76% and 88% accuracy respectively (naive baselines obtain 48% and 60%). Furthermore, optimising expert debaters for persuasiveness in an unsupervised manner improves non-expert ability to identify the truth in debates. Our results provide encouraging empirical evidence for the viability of aligning models with debate in the absence of ground truth. Copyright 2024 by the author(s)

AB  - In this study, we proposed a novel chatbot interaction strategy based on the suggestive ending of answers. This strategy is inspired by the cliffhanger ending narrative technique, which ends a story without specifying conclusions to spark readers' curiosity as to what will happen next and is often used in television series. Common chatbots provide relevant and comprehensive answers to users' questions. In contrast, chatbots with our proposed strategy end their answers with hints potentially interest-triggering users. The suggestive ending strategy aims to stimulate users' inquisition for critical decision-making, relating to a psychological phenomenon where humans are often urged to finish the uncompleted tasks they have initiated. We demonstrated the implication of our strategy by conducting an online user study involving 300 participants, where they used chatbots to perform three decision-making tasks. We adopted a between-subjects factorial experimental design and compared between the following UIs: (1) plain chatbot—it provides a generated answer when participants issue a question; (2) expositive chatbot—it provides a generated answer for a question, adding short summaries of a positive and negative person's opinion for the answer; (3) suggestive chatbot—it provides a generated answer for a question, which ends with a suggestion of a positive and negative person for the answer. We found that users of the suggestive chatbot were inclined to ask more questions to the bot, engage in prolonged decision-making and information-seeking actions, and formulate their opinions from various perspectives. These findings vary with the users' experience with plain and expositive chatbots. Copyright © 2024 Yamamoto.

AB  - Mobile applications have seen a growing prevalence in the healthcare sector, yet the absence of comprehensive regulations and preliminary assessments can lead to significant frustration and time loss for users. To address this, Persuasive System Design (PSD) principles and the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) have emerged as popular tools for gauging application quality and user engagement. However, their manual assessment requirements hinder scalability, especially given the high volume of mobile health applications in the market. This study introduces a novel automatic evaluation approach designed to enhance the assessment of mobile health applications, leveraging PSD and MARS. The proposed method mainly relies on large language models to filter user reviews and generate sentence embeddings for classifying the PSD principles implemented in these applications. The results, calculated using performance metrics that compare the model’s predictions with expert evaluations, demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the application’s implementation of PSD principles based on user reviews while also highlighting the limitations of using application descriptions alone for successful prediction. Furthermore, the study augments the predicted classification probabilities of PSD principles with supplementary descriptive data, such as installation counts and user ratings, to predict MARS scores. Regression models, trained using these techniques, consistently outperform basic models, with feature importance scores showing the significant contribution of predicted classification probabilities of PSD principles to the models. In summary, this study suggests that automatic evaluation techniques can effectively assess the quality and user engagement of mobile health applications, offering a viable alternative to manual assessments. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - We investigate intention detection in persuasive multi-turn dialogues employing the largest available Large Language Models (LLMs). Much of the prior research measures the intention detection capability of machine learning models without considering the conversational history. To evaluate LLMs' intention detection capability in conversation, we modified the existing datasets of persuasive conversation and created datasets using a multiple-choice paradigm. It is crucial to consider others' perspectives through their utterances when engaging in a persuasive conversation, especially when making a request or reply that is inconvenient for others. This feature makes the persuasive dialogue suitable for the dataset of measuring intention detection capability. We incorporate the concept of face acts, which categorize how utterances affect mental states. This approach enables us to measure intention detection capability by focusing on crucial intentions and to conduct comprehensible analysis according to intention types. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - A new era in Generative Artificial Intelligence has begun with the release of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have shown significant potential in marketing. Essentially, they have been redefining sales practices and changing sales funnel steps. Despite their promise and persuasive capabilities, there remains a dearth of comprehensive understanding regarding the capabilities of LLMs in generating sales arguments, which is a task traditionally characterized by high costs, time consumption, subjective biases, and the need for considerable expertise and skills. In this study, we take the first step towards exploring the ability of LLMs to generate sales arguments. To this end, we evaluated GPT-4 as one of the most capable LLMs to date in performing zero-shot sales argument creation from product features. We created a dataset containing textual descriptions of features extracted from brochures, catalogs, and technical data sheets of various products of a global company specializing in the manufacturing and retailing of furniture, appliances, and home accessories. We conducted a human evaluation with five experts, covering three main criteria of argument quality, namely coherence, persuasiveness, and relevance. The experimental results revealed the remarkable ability of GPT-4 to generate high-quality and well-structured sales arguments according to the Feature-Advantage-Benefit method. Over 98% of the evaluated arguments were coherent and persuasive. Regarding relevance, the model exhibited an accuracy of 91.53% to align the generated arguments to customers’ purchase motives, namely security, vanity, novelty, comfort, money, and likability. These findings could lead to significant time and cost reductions, allowing the sales force to focus on higher-value tasks. We posit that this study heralds a novel avenue for exploring LLMs’ capabilities in other steps of the sales funnel process. © (2024), (Intelligent Network and Systems Society). All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhetorical figures play an important role in influencing readers and listeners. Some of these word constructs that deviate from the usual language structure are known to be persuasive - antithesis is one of them. This figure combines parallel phrases with opposite ideas or words to highlight a contradiction. By identifying this figure, persuasive actors can be better identified. For this task, we create an annotated German dataset for antithesis detection. The dataset consists of posts from a Telegram channel criticizing the COVID-19 politics in Germany. Furthermore, we propose a three-block pipeline approach to detect the figure antithesis using large language models. Our pipeline splits the text into phrases, identifies phrases with a syntactically parallel structure, and detects if these parallel phrase pairs present opposing ideas by fine-tuning the German ELECTRA model, a state-of-the-art deep learning model for the German language. Furthermore, we compare the results with multilingual BERT and German BERT. Our novel approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods (F1-score of 50.43 %) for antithesis detection by achieving an F1-score of 65.11 %. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - Introduction Diabetes and hypertension are prevalent and costly to the health system. We have developed a mobile app (EMPOWER app) which enables remote monitoring and education through personalised nudges. We aim to study the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention comprising the EMPOWER mobile app with health coaching and shared decision-making for diabetes and hypertension. Methods We will conduct a two-arm, open-label, pragmatic randomised controlled trial (RCT). Participants with comorbid diabetes and hypertension enrolled from public primary care clinics will be randomised to either intervention or control in a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group participants will have access to health coaching with shared decision-making interventions in addition to the EMPOWER app and their usual primary care. The control group participants will continue to receive usual primary care and will neither receive the EMPOWER app nor health coaching and shared decision-making interventions. Our primary outcome is change in HbA1c level over 9 months. Secondary outcomes include change in systolic blood pressure, quality of life, patient activation, medication adherence, physical activity level, diet, and healthcare cost (direct and indirect) over 9 months. Discussion Our trial will provide key insights into clinical- and cost-effectiveness of a multi-component intervention comprising EMPOWER mobile app, health coaching and shared decision-making in diabetes and hypertension management. This trial will also offer evidence on cost-effective and sustainable methods for promoting behavioural changes among patients with comorbid diabetes and hypertension.

AB  - Diabetes technology continues to evolve, advancing with our understanding of human biology and improving our ability to treat people with diabetes. Diabetes devices are broadly classified into the following categories: glucose sensors, insulin delivery devices, and digital health care technology (i.e., software and mobile applications). When supported by education and individually tailored, technology can play a key role in optimizing outcomes. Digital devices assist in diabetes management by tracking meals, exercise, sleep, and glycemic measurements in real time, all of which can guide physicians and other clinicians in their decision-making. Here, as people with diabetes and patient advocates, as well as diabetes specialists, primary care providers, and diabetes care and education specialists, we present our perspectives on the advances, benefits, and challenges of diabetes technology in primary care practices. © 2024 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - As several studies demonstrate, good sleep quality is essential for individuals’ well-being, as a lack of restoring sleep may disrupt different physical, mental, and social dimensions of health. For this reason, there is increasing interest in tools for the monitoring of sleep based on personal sensors. However, there are currently few context-aware methods to help individuals to improve their sleep quality through behavior change tips. In order to tackle this challenge, in this paper, we propose a system that couples machine learning algorithms and large language models to forecast the next night’s sleep quality, and to provide context-aware behavior change tips to improve sleep. In order to encourage adherence and to increase trust, our system includes the use of large language models to describe the conditions that the machine learning algorithm finds harmful to sleep health, and to explain why the behavior change tips are generated as a consequence. We develop a prototype of our system, including a smartphone application, and perform experiments with a set of users. Results show that our system’s forecast is correlated to the actual sleep quality. Moreover, a preliminary user study suggests that the use of large language models in our system is useful in increasing trust and engagement. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - While human values play a crucial role in making arguments persuasive, we currently lack the necessary extensive datasets to develop methods for analyzing the values underlying these arguments on a large scale. To address this gap, we present the Touché23-ValueEval dataset, an expansion of the Webis-ArgValues-22 dataset. We collected and annotated an additional 4 780 new arguments, doubling the dataset's size to 9 324 arguments. These arguments were sourced from six diverse sources, covering religious texts, community discussions, free-text arguments, newspaper editorials, and political debates. Each argument is annotated by three crowdworkers for 54 human values, following the methodology established in the original dataset. The Touché23-ValueEval dataset was utilized in the SemEval 2023 Task 4. ValueEval: Identification of Human Values behind Arguments, where an ensemble of transformer models demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, our experiments show that a fine-tuned large language model, Llama-2-7B, achieves comparable results. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - The present study attempts to use the large language model (LLM) to create a model that identifies Aristotle's rhetorical principles-ethos (source credibility), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logic)-in response to COVID-19 information on a question-And-Answer community (social Q&A platform). The model differentiates between the most upvoted and random answers to analyze the presence of subdimensions of these rhetorical principles. The research utilized answers to COVID-19 questions on Naver Knowledge-iN, the most popular social Q&A platform in South Korea. A set of 193 answer pairs was randomly selected for training (135 pairs) and testing (58 pairs). These answers were coded for the three rhetorical principles and their subdimensions by researchers, which were used to refine models based on GPT 3.5 technology. The F1 scores were improved to. 88 (ethos),. 81 (pathos), and. 69 (logos). The fine-Tuned models were employed to analyze 128 newly drawn answer pairs of the most upvoted answers and random answers. The paired sample t-Tests indicated that rhetorical elements of logos such as factual information and logical reasoning were positively associated with health consumers' preference of information (answers) while the other rhetorical principles of ethos and pathos were not associated with consumer preference of health information. By utilizing the LLM for the analysis of persuasive content, which has been typically conducted manually with much labor and time, this study not only demonstrates feasibility of using the LLM in studies of the humanities and social sciences, but also contributes to expanding the horizon in the field of AI text extraction. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - In previous experiments we have conducted on the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), we have focused on the ability of biased search results to shift voting preferences. In three new experiments with a total of 1, 137 US residents (mean age = 33.2), we sought to determine whether biased search rankings could shift people’s opinions on topics that do not involve candidates or elections. Each of the new experiments looked at a different topic, and participants were pre-screened to make sure they didn’t have strong opinions about these topics. The topics were: Is artificial intelligence useful or dangerous? Is fracking helpful or dangerous? And: Are people born gay or do they choose to be gay? All participants were first asked various demographic questions, then shown brief summaries of the “pro” and “anti” views on each topic, and then asked their opinions about each topic. Next, participants were allowed to conduct an online search using our mock search engine (Kadoodle) lasting up to 15 minutes. In each experiment, one-third of the participants saw biased search results favoring one perspective; one-third saw biased search results favoring the opposing perspective; and one-third (the control group) saw mixed search results. After completing their search, participants were again asked for their opinions about the topic. Our primary dependent variable was Manipulation Power (MP), the percentage increase in the number of participants favoring one viewpoint after having viewed search rankings favoring that viewpoint. The MPs in the three experiments were 25.0%, 30.9%, and 17.8%, respectively. Corresponding shifts were also found for how persuasive participants found each viewpoint to be and for how much they trusted each viewpoint. We conclude that search rankings favoring one viewpoint on a wide range of topics might be able to cause people who have not yet formulated a strong opinion on such topics to adopt the favored perspective. If our findings prove to be robust, we are exposing what might be considered an unforeseen consequence of the creation of search engines, namely that even without human interference, search algorithms will inevitably alter the thinking and behavior of billions of people worldwide on perhaps any topic for which they have not yet formed strong opinions. © 2024 Epstein, Li.

AB  - Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI–human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion, which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion, involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees’ creativity in answering customers’ questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees’ interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skill-biased by favoring experts with greater job skills. © 2024 Academy of Management.

AB  - One of the greatest challenges of computational argumentation research consists of creating persuasive strategies that can effectively influence the behaviour of a human user. From the human perspective, argumentation represents one of the most effective ways to reason and to persuade other parties. Furthermore, it is very common that humans adapt their discourse depending on the audience in order to be more persuasive. Thus, it is of utmost importance to take into account user modelling features for personalising the interactions with human users. Through computational argumentation, we can not only devise the optimal solution, but also provide the rationale for it. However, synergies between computational argumentative reasoning and computational persuasion have not been researched in depth. In this paper, we propose a new formal framework aimed at improving the persuasiveness of arguments resulting from the computational argumentative reasoning process. For that purpose, our approach relies on an underlying abstract argumentation framework to implement this reasoning and extends it with persuasive features. Thus, we combine a set of user modelling and linguistic features through the use of a persuasive function in order to instantiate abstract arguments following a user-specific persuasive policy. From the results observed in our experiments, we can conclude that the framework proposed in this work improves the persuasiveness of argument-based computational systems. Furthermore, we have also been able to determine that human users place a high level of trust in decision support systems when they are persuaded using arguments and when the reasons behind the suggestion to modify their behaviour are provided. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - In this work we consider the impact of information spread in time-varying social networks, where agents request to follow other agents with aligned opinions while dropping ties to neighbors whose posts are too dissimilar to their own views. Opinion control and rhetorical influence has a very long history, employing various methods including education, persuasion, propaganda, marketing, and manipulation through mis-, dis-, and mal-information. The automation of opinion controllers, however, has only recently become easily deployable at a wide scale, with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and generative AI that can translate the quantified commands from opinion controllers into actual content with the appropriate nuance. Automated agents in social networks can be deployed for various purposes, such as breaking up echo chambers, bridging valuable new connections between agents, or shaping the opinions of a target population-and all of these raise important ethical concerns that deserve serious attention and thoughtful discussion and debate. This paper attempts to contribute to this discussion by considering three archetypal influencing styles observed by human drivers in these settings, comparing and contrasting the impact of these different control methods on the opinions of agents in the network. We will demonstrate the efficacy of current generative AI for generating nuanced content consistent with the command signal from automatic opinion controllers like these, and we will report on frameworks for approaching the relevant ethical considerations. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Forty-four percent of Canadians over the age of 20 have a non-communicable disease (NCD). Millions of Canadians are at risk of developing the complications of NCDs; millions have already experienced those complications. Fortunately, the evidence base for NCD prevention and behavior change is large and growing and digital technologies can deliver them at scale and with high fidelity. However, the current model of in-person primary care is not designed nor capable of operationalizing that evidence. New developments in artificial intelligence that can predict who will develop NCD or the complications of NCD are increasingly available, making the challenge of delivering disease prevention even more urgent. This paper presents findings from stakeholder engagement on a design architecture to address three initial barriers to large-scale deployment of health management and behavior change evidence: 1) the challenges of regulating mobile health apps, 2) the challenge of creating a value-based rationale for payers to invest in deploying mobile health apps at scale, and 3) the high cost of customer acquisition for delivering mobile health apps to those at risk.  © 2024 The Authors.

AB  - Argumentative Essay Generation (AEG) is a challenging task in computational argumentation, where detailed logical reasoning and effective rhetorical skills are essential. Previous methods on argument generation typically involve planning prior to generation. However, the planning strategies in these methods overlook the exploration of the logical reasoning process. Inspired by argument structure-related theories, we propose an argumentative planning strategy for prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate high-quality essays. This strategy comprises two stages: (1) Sketch planning, which creates a rough outline of the essay, and (2) Dialectical planning, which refines the outline through critical self-reflection. Such a planning strategy enables LLMs to write argumentative essays that are more logical, diverse, and persuasive. Furthermore, due to the scarcity of existing AEG datasets, we construct three new datasets. These datasets are from two domains: exam essays and news editorials, covering both Chinese and English. Automatic and manual evaluation on four datasets show that our method can generate more dialectical and persuasive essays with higher diversity compared to several strong baselines. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - We introduce BUST, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate detectors of texts generated by instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs). Unlike previous benchmarks, our focus lies on evaluating the performance of detector systems, acknowledging the inevitable influence of the underlying tasks and different LLM generators. Our benchmark dataset consists of 25K texts from humans and 7 LLMs responding to instructions across 10 tasks from 3 diverse sources. Using the benchmark, we evaluated 5 detectors and found substantial performance variance across tasks. A meta-analysis of the dataset characteristics was conducted to guide the examination of detector performance. The dataset was analyzed using diverse metrics assessing linguistic features like fluency and coherence, readability scores, and writer attitudes, such as emotions, convincingness, and persuasiveness. Features impacting detector performance were investigated with surrogate models, revealing emotional content in texts enhanced some detectors, yet the most effective detector demonstrated consistent performance, irrespective of writer’s attitudes and text styles. Our approach focused on investigating relationships between the detectors’ performance and two key factors: text characteristics and LLM generators. We believe BUST will provide valuable insights into selecting detectors tailored to specific text styles and tasks and facilitate a more practical and in-depth investigation of detection systems for LLM-generated text. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - With the aid of large language models, current conversational recommender system (CRS) has gaining strong abilities to persuade users to accept recommended items. While these CRSs are highly persuasive, they can mislead users by incorporating incredible information in their explanations, ultimately damaging the long-term trust between users and the CRS. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective method, called PC-CRS, to enhance the credibility of CRS's explanations during persuasion. It guides the explanation generation through our proposed credibility-aware persuasive strategies and then gradually refines explanations via post-hoc self-reflection. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of PC-CRS in promoting persuasive and credible explanations. Further analysis reveals the reason behind current methods producing incredible explanations and the potential of credible explanations to improve recommendation accuracy. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the need for continued development of symptom monitoring (SM) implementation, utilization, and data usage at the macro-, meso-, and micro-levels. Methods: Discussions from a patient-reported SM workshop at the MASCC/ISSO 2022 annual meeting were analyzed using a macro-meso-micro analytical framework of cancer care delivery. The workshop categories “initiation and implementation, barriers to adoption and utilization, and data usage” were integrated for each level. Results: At the macro-level, policy development could encourage data sharing and international collaboration, including the exchange of SM methods, supportive care models, and self-management modules. At the meso-level, institutions should adjust clinical workflow and service delivery and promote a thorough technical and clinical integration of SM. At the micro-level, SM should be individualized, with timely feedback for patients, and should foster trust and understanding of AI decision support tools amongst clinicians to improve supportive care. Conclusions: The workshop reached a consensus among international experts on providing guidance on SM implementation, utilization, and (big) data usage pathways in cancer survivors across the cancer continuum and on macro-meso-micro levels. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Connecting neural activity to function is a common aim in neuroscience. How to define and conceptualize function, however, can vary. Here I focus on grounding this goal in the specific question of how a given change in behavior is produced by a change in neural circuits or activity. Artificial neural network models offer a particularly fruitful format for tackling such questions because they use neural mechanisms to perform complex transformations and produce appropriate behavior. Therefore, they can be a means of causally testing the extent to which a neural change can be responsible for an experimentally observed behavioral change. Furthermore, because the field of interpretability in artificial intelligence has similar aims, neuroscientists can look to interpretability methods for new ways of identifying neural features that drive performance and behaviors. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-Of-Context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image- text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which are essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual rea- soning and explanation generation, they still lack sophisti- cation in understanding and discovering the subtle cross- modal differences. In this paper, we introduce Sniffer,a novel multimodal large language model specifically engi- neered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. Snifferemploys two-stage instruction tuning on Instruct- BLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the sec- ond stage leverages OOC-specific instruction data gener- ated by language-only GPT-4 to fine-tune the model's dis- criminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and re- trieval, Sniffernot only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for con- textual verification. Our experiments show that Sniffersurpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. Snifferalso provides accurate and persuasive explanations as val- idated by quantitative and human evaluations. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Powered by artificial intelligence (AI), chatbots are increasingly capable of simulating human-like conversations. But, is this desirable for strategic communications? Will chatbots be more persuasive if they are more human-like, not only in their appearance but also in their interaction and delivery of advertising content? We explored these questions with a 2 (chatbot profile: human-like vs. machine-like) x 2 (message interactivity: high vs. low) x 2 (ad type: narrative vs. factual) experiment (N = 414). Data reveal that high message interactivity fosters positive attitudes toward the chatbot and the ad by mitigating violated expectancy. Narrative ads promote chatbot advertising through perceived transportation. A three-way interaction revealed that when a chatbot is machine-like in appearance, higher interactivity and adoption of a narrative style of delivery serve to increase ad persuasiveness by heightening social presence. Theoretical and practical implications for chatbot advertising are discussed. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Labor shortages and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI) technology have accelerated the application of AI chatbot agents in fundraising agencies. This study examines the applicability of the legitimization of the paltry favors (LPF) technique and chatbot image representation in raising the persuasive power of fundraising chatbots. In this study, 609 participants were recruited via a crowdsourcing website to participate in an online survey. Participants were assigned to one of six chatbot conditions (text only vs. robot image vs. human image × standard message vs. LPF message). The results revealed that the LPF message increases the willingness to donate and that self-image concern, requestor need, and guilt significantly mediate the direct effect. The results also suggest the moderating role of perceived anthropomorphism in the association between LPF messages and the willingness to donate via requester needs. The results provide theoretical implications for compliance-gaining studies and practical implications for fundraising organizations and chatbot developers. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2023.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a common, serious and costly chronic disease. Current clinical practice guidelines recommend that providers augment the longitudinal care of people living with obesity with consistent support for the development of self-efficacy and motivation to modify their lifestyle behaviors. Lifestyle behavior change aligns with the goals of motivational interviewing (MI), a client-centered yet directive counseling modality. However, training health care providers to be proficient in MI is expensive and time-consuming, resulting in a lack of trained counselors and limiting the widespread adoption of MI in clinical practice. Artificial intelligence (AI) counselors accessible via the internet can help circumvent these barriers. Objective: The primary objective is to explore the feasibility of conducting unscripted MI-consistent counseling using Neural Agent for Obesity Motivational Interviewing (NAOMI), a large language model (LLM)–based web app for weight loss counseling. The secondary objectives are to test the acceptability and usability of NAOMI’s counseling and examine its ability to shift motivational precursors in a sample of patients with overweight and obesity recruited from primary care clinics. Methods: NAOMI will be developed based on recent advances in deep learning in four stages. In stages 1 and 2, NAOMI will be implemented using an open-source foundation LLM and (1) few-shot learning based on a prompt with task-specific instructions and (2) domain adaptation strategy based on fine-tuning LLM using a large corpus of general psychotherapy and MI treatment transcripts. In stages 3 and 4, we will refine the best of these 2 approaches. Each NAOMI version will be evaluated using a mixed methods approach in which 10 adults (18-65 years) meeting the criteria for overweight or obesity (25.0≥BMI≤39.9) interact with NAOMI and provide feedback. NAOMI’s fidelity to the MI framework will be assessed using the Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity scale. Participants’ general perceptions of AI conversational agents and NAOMI specifically will be assessed via Pre- and Post-Interaction Questionnaires. Motivational precursors, such as participants’ confidence, importance, and readiness for changing lifestyle behaviors (eg, diet and activity), will be measured before and after the interaction, and 1 week later. A qualitative analysis of changes in the measures of perceptions of AI agents and counselors and motivational precursors will be performed. Participants will rate NAOMI’s usability and empathic skills post interaction via questionnaire-based assessments along with providing feedback about their experience with NAOMI via a qualitative interview. Results: NAOMI (version 1.0) has been developed. Participant recruitment will commence in September 2024. Data collection activities are expected to conclude in May 2025. Conclusions: If proven effective, LLM-based counseling agents can become a cost-effective approach for addressing the obesity epidemic at a public health level. They can also have a broad, transformative impact on the delivery of MI and other psychotherapeutic treatment modalities extending their reach and broadening access. ©Alexander Kotov, April Idalski Carcone, Elizabeth Towner.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) technology has brought convenience to human lives, but its pervasive impact extends beyond individuals, affecting society as a whole. Consequently, the necessity for an AI ethics education program has become increasingly apparent. This study aims to investigate the influence of an experimental research study that developed and implemented an AI ethics education program for learners’ ethical awareness and attitude towards AI. The research methodology involved validating a model of the AI ethics education program by applying it to a group of 10 domain experts. Additionally, pre-test and post-test designs were employed with 17 middle school students as the experimental group. The same assessment was administered before and after the implementation of the AI ethics education program, and the data were analyzed using paired-sample t-tests. The findings of this study are as follows: Firstly, an AI ethics education program model was developed, incorporating key competencies such as AI literacy, critical thinking skills in AI, and AI problem-solving skills, all within the context of AI ethics. The implementation of this model was effective in the educational setting. Secondly, significant improvements were observed in the ethical awareness of middle school students across all domains after participating in the program. Thirdly, the attitudes of middle school students towards AI exhibited significant enhancements across all domains. These findings contribute to the broader field of AI ethics education by highlighting the importance of ethical awareness in AI and fostering favorable attitudes towards AI. The implications of this study are significant for the field of AI education. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This Work-in-Progress research paper evaluates the validity of Large Language Models (LLMs) as conversational AI tutors for computer science learning. While current engineering education literature has predominantly emphasized the rapid evolution of LLMs as conversational AI tutors for programming languages, the exploration into their effectiveness within general STEM topics remains comparatively scarce. This WIP study thus centers on evaluating the potential of LLMs to facilitate understanding of core hardware design concepts critical to computer science and engineering (CSE) education. By cross-checking the responses from generative AI chatbots to an openended CSE-based question, we aimed to uncover how LLMs, such as ChatGPT-3.5, Claude, Gemini, and Meta AI, can contribute to teaching and learning of general CSE courses instead of a specifically coding-based one. Our method involved simulating a student query on the popular debate between CISC vs. RISC related to computer architecture and analyzing the chatbots' responses. This initial collection of data served as the foundation for a continual comparative analysis aimed at determining the inherent instructional value of each LLM and its validity and reliability. To systematically assess the responses, we introduced an evaluation framework focusing on metrics, such as response accuracy, persuasiveness, and depth of explanation. The current work anticipates not only enriching our understanding of how these advanced LLMs can support general CSE education but also identifying areas where further development is needed for a more holistic integration of LLM-based chatbots in assisting student comprehension in the overarching engineering education. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - With the recent advances of large language models (LLMs), it is no longer infeasible to build an automated debate system that helps people to synthesise persuasive arguments. Previous work attempted this task by integrating multiple components. In our work, we introduce an argument mining dataset that captures the end-to-end process of preparing an argumentative essay for a debate, which covers the tasks of claim and evidence identification (Task 1 ED), evidence convincingness ranking (Task 2 ECR), argumentative essay summarisation and human preference ranking (Task 3 ASR) and metric learning for automated evaluation of resulting essays, based on human feedback along argument quality dimensions (Task 4 SQE). Our dataset contains 14k examples of claims that are fully annotated with the various properties supporting the aforementioned tasks. We evaluate multiple generative baselines for each of these tasks, including representative LLMs. We find, that while they show promising results on individual tasks in our benchmark, their end-to-end performance on all four tasks in succession deteriorates significantly, both in automated measures as well as in human-centred evaluation. This challenge presented by our proposed dataset motivates future research on end-to-end argument mining and summarisation.

AB  - The rapid spread of misinformation on social media, particularly during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, underscores the urgent need for effective detection systems. Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for combating misinformation due to their extensive world knowledge and strong reasoning abilities. However, LLMs also present challenges to misinformation detection systems, as they can be misused to generate highly persuasive disinformation. This study investigates the dual role of LLMs as both generators and evaluators of fake news, focusing on four models: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. We evaluate their ability to detect fake news within mixed datasets of real and fake news, generated by LLMs. Our findings highlight the strengths and limitations of modern LLMs in identifying misinformation in short-form contexts, offering valuable insights into mitigating the spread of fake news. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces DebateBrawl, an innovative AI-powered debate platform that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs), Genetic Algorithms (GA), and Adversarial Search (AS) to create an adaptive and engaging debating experience. DebateBrawl addresses the limitations of traditional LLMs in strategic planning by incorporating evolutionary optimization and game-theoretic techniques. The system demonstrates remarkable performance in generating coherent, contextually relevant arguments while adapting its strategy in real-time. Experimental results involving 23 debates show balanced outcomes between AI and human participants, with the AI system achieving an average score of 2.72 compared to the human average of 2.67 out of 10. User feedback indicates significant improvements in debating skills and a highly satisfactory learning experience, with 85% of users reporting improved debating abilities and 78% finding the AI opponent appropriately challenging. The system's ability to maintain high factual accuracy (92% compared to 78% in human-only debates) while generating diverse arguments addresses critical concerns in AI-assisted discourse. DebateBrawl not only serves as an effective educational tool but also contributes to the broader goal of improving public discourse through AI-assisted argumentation. The paper discusses the ethical implications of AI in persuasive contexts and outlines the measures implemented to ensure responsible development and deployment of the system, including robust fact-checking mechanisms and transparency in decision-making processes. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about their potential to create and propagate convincing narratives.Here, we study their performance in detecting convincing arguments to gain insights into LLMs' persuasive capabilities without directly engaging in experimentation with humans.We extend a dataset by Durmus and Cardie (2018) with debates, votes, and user traits and propose tasks measuring LLMs' ability to (1) distinguish between strong and weak arguments, (2) predict stances based on beliefs and demographic characteristics, and (3) determine the appeal of an argument to an individual based on their traits.We show that LLMs perform on par with humans in these tasks and that combining predictions from different LLMs yields significant performance gains, surpassing human performance.The data and code released with this paper contribute to the crucial effort of continuously evaluating and monitoring LLMs' capabilities and potential impact.(https://go.epfl.ch/persuasion-llm). © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - The proliferation of online misinformation presents a significant challenge, requiring scalable strategies for effective mitigation. While detection methods exist, current reactive approaches, like content flagging and banning, are short-term and insufficient. Additionally, advancements like large language models (LLMs) exacerbate the issue by enabling large-scale creation and dissemination of misinformation. Thus, sustainable, scalable solutions that encourage behavior change and broaden perspectives by persuading misinformants against their viewpoints or broadening their perspectives are needed. To this end, we propose persuasive LLM-based dialogue systems to tackle misinformation. However, challenges arise due to the lack of suitable datasets and formal frameworks for generating persuasive responses. Inspired by existing methods for countering online hate speech, we explore adapting counter-hate response strategies for misinformation. Since misinformation and hate speech often coexist despite differing intentions, we develop classifiers to identify and annotate response strategies from hate-speech counter-responses for use in misinformation scenarios. Human evaluations show a 91% agreement on the applicability of these strategies to misinformation. Next, as a scalable counter-misinformation solution, we create an LLM-based argument graph framework that generates persuasive responses, using the strategies as control codes to adjust the style and content. Human evaluations and case studies demonstrate that our framework generates expert-like responses and is 14% more engaging, 21% more natural, and 18% more factual than the best available alternatives. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - This study introduces online advertising platforms as digital composing tools where persuasive rhetoric encourages users to follow links and take action on landing pages. It frames these platforms as digital spaces where human actors work alongside non-human AI agents (Duin & Pedersen, 2021 & 2023) and where rhetorical agency emerges through the activity of machine learning and artificial intelligence. It theorizes a (human) user-centered approach to composing digital ads in digital advertising platforms built around Walton, Moore & Jones’ (2019) framework of positionality, position, and power. It provides guidance for technical and professional writers in placing human users at the center of an abstracted, algorithm-driven partnership where generative AI appears poised to wrest power from both composers and users. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) answering questions with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can face conflicting evidence in the retrieved documents. While prior works study how textual features like perplexity and readability influence the persuasiveness of evidence, humans consider more than textual content when evaluating conflicting information on the web. In this paper, we focus on the following question: When two webpages contain conflicting information to answer a question, does non-textual information affect the LLM’s reasoning and answer? We consider three types of non-textual information: (1) the webpage’s publication time, (2) the source where the webpage is from, and (3) the appearance of the webpage. We give the LLM a Yes/No question and two conflicting webpages that support yes and no, respectively. We exchange the non-textual information in the two webpages to see if the LLMs tend to use the information from a newer, more reliable, and more visually appealing webpage. We find that changing the publication time of the webpage can change the answer for most LLMs, but changing the webpage’s source merely changes the LLM’s answer. We also reveal that the webpage’s appearance has a strong causal effect on Claude-3’s answers.

AB  - The paper describes the ways in which artificial intelligence (AI) is being used by political parties and candidates during electoral campaigns, under democratic systems, with the aim of winning the largest number of votes and thus gaining access to elected office. Therefore, the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in electoral campaigns within democratic political systems is examined. Using a descriptive methodology, it was possible to identify and systematize the different ways and actions that are carried out during electoral campaigns, which are supported or performed by computers or automated cybernetic systems. It is concluded that AI is modifying the way electoral campaigns are conducted, which calls for a new normative or regulatory framework for these political processes and, above all, codes of ethical conduct to avoid the violation of democratic systems. © 2024, Universidad del Zulia.

AB  - Digital interventions often suffer from low usage, which may reflect insufficient attention to user experience. Moreover, the existing evaluation methods have limited applicability in the remote study of user experience of complex interventions that have expansive content and that are used over an extensive period of time. To alleviate these challenges, we describe here a novel qualitative Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) method: the CORTO method (Contextual, One-item, Repeated, Timely, Open-ended). We used it to gather digital intervention user experience data from Finnish adults (n = 184) who lived with interview-confirmed major depressive disorder (MDD) and took part in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) that studied the efficacy of a novel 12-week game-based digital intervention for depression. A second dataset on user experience was gathered with retrospective interviews (n = 22). We inductively coded the CORTO method and retrospective interview data, which led to four user experience categories: (1) contextual use, (2) interaction-elicited emotional experience, (3) usability, and (4) technical issues. Then, we used the created user experience categories and Template Analysis to analyze both datasets together, and reported the results qualitatively. Finally, we compared the two datasets with each other. We found that the data generated with the CORTO method offered more insights into usability and technical categories than the interview data that particularly illustrated the contextual use. The emotional valence of the interview data was more positive compared with the CORTO data. Both the CORTO and interview data detected 55 % of the micro-level categories; 20 % of micro-level categories were only detected by the CORTO data and 25 % only by the interview data. We found that the during-intervention user experience measurement with the CORTO method can provide intervention-specific insights, and thereby further the iterative user-centered intervention development. Overall, these findings highlight the impact of evaluation methods on the categories and qualities of insights acquired in intervention research. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Modern software systems must adapt to dynamic artificial intelligence (AI) environments and evolving requirements. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) effectively isolates crosscutting concerns (CCs) into single modules called aspects, enhancing quality metrics, and simplifying testing. However, AOP implementation can lead to unexpected program outputs and behavior changes. This paper proposes an AI-enhanced, adaptive monitoring framework for validating program behaviors during aspect weaving that integrates AOP interfaces (AOPIs) with large language models (LLMs), i.e. GPT-Codex AI, to dynamically generate and optimize monitoring aspects and statistical models in realtime. This enables intelligent run-time analysis, adaptive model checking, and natural language (NL) interaction. We tested the framework on ten diverse Java classes from JHotdraw 7.6 by extracting context and numerical data and building a dataset for analysis. By dynamically refining aspects and models based on observed behavior, its results showed that the framework maintained the integrity of the Java OOP class while providing predictive insights into potential conflicts and optimizations. Results demonstrate the framework’s efficacy in detecting subtle behavioral changes induced by aspect weaving, with a 94% accuracy in identifying potential conflicts and a 37% reduction in false positives compared to traditional static analysis techniques. Furthermore, the integration of explainable AI provides developers with clear, actionable explanations for flagged behaviors through NL interfaces, enhancing interpretability and trust in the system. © (2024), (Science and Information Organization).

AB  - Adopting and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors such as regular exercise and balanced nutrition remain challenging despite their well-documented benefits for preventing chronic diseases and promoting overall well-being. Motivational Interviewing (MI) has emerged as a promising technique to address ambivalence and facilitate behavior change. However, traditional face-to-face delivery of MI interventions is limited by scalability and accessibility issues. Leveraging recent advancements in LLMs, this paper proposes an innovative approach to deliver MI-based coaching for lifestyle behavior change digitally. Following a problem-centered DSR approach, we created an initial prototype based on MI theory and qualitative user interviews using ChatGPT (GPT-3.5). We evaluated our prototype in a qualitative study. Our research outcomes include five design principles and thirteen system requirements. This research enhances the design knowledge base in LLM-based health coaching. It marks an essential first step towards designing LLM-based MI interventions, contributing valuable insights for future research in this emerging field. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Persuasive dialogue is a type of dialogue commonly used in human daily life in scenarios such as promotion and sales. Its purpose is to influence the decision, attitude or behavior of another person through the dialogue process. Persuasive automated dialogue systems can be applied in a variety of fields such as charity, business, education, and healthcare. Regardless of their amazing abilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT still have limitations in persuasion. There is few research dedicated to persuasive dialogue in the current research of automated dialogue systems. In this paper, we introduce a persuasive automated dialogue system. In the system, a context-aware persuasion strategy selection module makes dialogue system flexibly use different persuasion strategies to persuade users; Then a natural language generation module is used to output a response. We also propose a persuasiveness prediction model to automatically evaluate the persuasiveness of generated text. Experimental results show that our dialogue system can achieve better performance on several automated evaluation metrics than baseline models. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - Cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs) are the major types of non-communicable diseases, contributing to huge disease burdens in the Western Pacific region (WPR). The use of digital health (dHealth) technologies, such as wearable gadgets, mobile apps, and artificial intelligence (AI), facilitates interventions for CMDs prevention and treatment. Currently, most studies on dHealth and CMDs in WPR were conducted in a few high- and middle-income countries like Australia, China, Japan, the Republic of Korea, and New Zealand. Evidence indicated that dHealth services promoted early prevention by behavior interventions, and AI-based innovation brought automated diagnosis and clinical decision-support. dHealth brought facilitators for the doctor-patient interplay in the effectiveness, experience, and communication skills during healthcare services, with rapidly development during the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019. In the future, the improvement of dHealth services in WPR needs to gain more policy support, enhance technology innovation and privacy protection, and perform cost-effectiveness research. © 2023

AB  - In this manuscript we describe the UMUTeam's participation in SemEval-2024 Task 4, a shared task to identify different persuasion techniques in memes. The task is divided into three subtasks. One is a multimodal subtask of identifying whether a meme contains persuasion or not. The others are hierarchical multi-label classifications that consider textual content alone or a multimodal setting of text and visual content. This is a multilingual task, and we participated in all three subtasks but we focus only on the English dataset. Our approach is based on a fine-tuning approach with the pre-trained RoBERTa-large model. In addition, for multimodal cases with both textual and visual content, we used the LMM called LlaVa to extract image descriptions and combine them with the meme text. Our system performed well in three subtasks, achieving the tenth best result with an Hierarchical F1 of 64.774%, the fourth best in Subtask 2a with an Hierarchical F1 of 69.003%, and the eighth best in Subtask 2b with a Macro F1 of 78.660%. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Background: Obesity is considered to be a risk factor for various diseases, and its incidence has tripled worldwide since 1975. In addition to potentially being at risk for adverse health outcomes, people with overweight or obesity are often stigmatised. Behaviour change interventions are increasingly delivered as mobile health (m-health) interventions, using smartphone apps and wearables. They are believed to support healthy behaviours at the individual level in a low-threshold manner. Objectives: To assess the effects of integrated smartphone applications for adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and LILACS, as well as the trials registers ClinicalTrials.gov and World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform on 2 October 2023 (date of last search for all databases). We placed no restrictions on the language of publication. Selection criteria: Participants were adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity. Eligible interventions were integrated smartphone apps using at least two behaviour change techniques. The intervention could target physical activity, cardiorespiratory fitness, weight loss, healthy diet, or self-efficacy. Comparators included no or minimal intervention (NMI), a different smartphone app, personal coaching, or usual care. Eligible studies were randomised controlled trials of any duration with a follow-up of at least three months. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodology and the RoB 2 tool. Important outcomes were physical activity, body mass index (BMI) and weight, health-related quality of life, self-efficacy, well-being, change in dietary behaviour, and adverse events. We focused on presenting studies with medium- (6 to < 12 months) and long-term (≥ 12 months) outcomes in our summary of findings table, following recommendations in the core outcome set for behavioural weight management interventions. Main results: We included 18 studies with 2703 participants. Interventions lasted from 2 to 24 months. The mean BMI in adults ranged from 27 to 50, and the median BMI z-score in adolescents ranged from 2.2 to 2.5. Smartphone app versus no or minimal intervention. Thirteen studies compared a smartphone app versus NMI in adults; no studies were available for adolescents. The comparator comprised minimal health advice, handouts, food diaries, smartphone apps unrelated to weight loss, and waiting list. Measures of physical activity: at 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app compared to NMI probably reduces moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) slightly (mean difference (MD) −28.9 min/week (95% confidence interval (CI) −85.9 to 28; 1 study, 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence)). We are very uncertain about the results of estimated energy expenditure and cardiorespiratory fitness at eight months' follow-up. A smartphone app compared with NMI probably results in little to no difference in changes in total activity time at 12 months' follow-up and leisure time physical activity at 24 months' follow-up. Anthropometric measures: a smartphone app compared with NMI may reduce BMI (MD of BMI change −2.6 kg/m2, 95% CI −6 to 0.8; 2 studies, 146 participants; very low-certainty evidence) at six to eight months' follow-up, but the evidence is very uncertain. At 12 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in BMI change (MD −0.1 kg/m2, 95% CI −0.4 to 0.3; 1 study; 650 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in body weight change (MD −2.5 kg, 95% CI −6.8 to 1.7; 3 studies, 1044 participants; low-certainty evidence) at 12 months' follow-up. At 24 months' follow-up, a smartphone app probably resulted in little to no difference in body weight change (MD 0.7 kg, 95% CI −1.2 to 2.6; 1 study, 245 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). A smartphone app compared with NMI may result in little to no difference in self-efficacy for a physical activity score at eight months' follow-up, but the results are very uncertain. A smartphone app probably results in little to no difference in quality of life and well-being at 12 months (moderate-certainty evidence) and in little to no difference in various measures used to inform dietary behaviour at 12 and 24 months' follow-up. We are very uncertain about adverse events, which were only reported narratively in two studies (very low-certainty evidence). Smartphone app versus another smartphone app. Two studies compared different versions of the same app in adults, showing no or minimal differences in outcomes. One study in adults compared two different apps (calorie counting versus ketogenic diet) and suggested a slight reduction in body weight at six months in favour of the ketogenic diet app. No studies were available for adolescents. Smartphone app versus personal coaching. Only one study compared a smartphone app with personal coaching in adults, presenting data at three months. Two studies compared these interventions in adolescents. A smartphone app resulted in little to no difference in BMI z-score compared to personal coaching at six months' follow-up (MD 0, 95% CI −0.2 to 0.2; 1 study; 107 participants). Smartphone app versus usual care. Only one study compared an app with usual care in adults but only reported data at three months on participant satisfaction. No studies were available for adolescents. We identified 34 ongoing studies. Authors' conclusions: The available evidence is limited and does not demonstrate a clear benefit of smartphone applications as interventions for adolescents or adults with overweight or obesity. While the number of studies is growing, the evidence remains incomplete due to the high variability of the apps' features, content and components, which complicates direct comparisons and assessment of their effectiveness. Comparisons with either no or minimal intervention or personal coaching show minor effects, which are mostly not clinically significant. Minimal data for adolescents also warrants further research. Evidence is also scarce for low- and middle-income countries as well as for people with different socio-economic and cultural backgrounds. The 34 ongoing studies suggest sustained interest in the topic, with new evidence expected to emerge within the next two years. In practice, clinicians and healthcare practitioners should carefully consider the potential benefits, limitations, and evolving research when recommending smartphone apps to adolescents and adults with overweight or obesity.

AB  - Within Motivational Interviewing (MI), client utterances are coded as for or against a certain behaviour change, along with commitment strength; this is essential to ensure therapists soften rather than persisting goal-related actions in the face of resistance. Prior works in MI agents have been scripted or semi-scripted, limiting users’ natural language expressions. With the aim of automating the MI interactions, we propose and explore the task of automated identification of client motivational language. Employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we compare in-context learning (ICL) and instruction fine-tuning (IFT) with varying training sizes for this identification task. Our experiments show that both approaches can learn under low-resourced settings. Our results demonstrate that IFT, though cheaper, is more stable to prompt choice, and yields better performance with more data. Given the detected motivation, we further present an approach to the analysis of therapists’ strategies for balancing building rapport with clients with advancing the treatment plan. A framework of MI agents is developed using insights from the data and the psychotherapy literature. ©2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Persuasive dialogue requires multi-turn following and planning abilities to achieve the goal of persuading users, which is still challenging even for state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs). Previous works focus on retrieval-based models or generative models in a specific domain due to a lack of data across multiple domains. In this paper, we leverage GPT-4 to create the first multi-domain persuasive dialogue dataset DailyPersuasion. Then we propose a general method named PersuGPT to learn a persuasion model based on LLMs through intent-to-strategy reasoning, which summarizes the intent of user's utterance and reasons next strategy to respond. Moreover, we design a simulation-based preference optimization, which utilizes a learned user model and our model to simulate next turns and estimate their rewards more accurately. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that our proposed method outperforms all baselines in terms of automatic evaluation metric Win-Rate and human evaluation.

AB  - Most traditional AI safety research views models as machines and centers on algorithm-focused attacks developed by security experts. As large language models (LLMs) become increasingly common and competent, non-expert users can also impose risks during daily interactions. Observing this, we shift the perspective, by treating LLMs as human-like communicators to examine the interplay between everyday language interaction and AI safety. Specifically, we study how to persuade LLMs to jailbreak them. First, we propose a persuasion taxonomy derived from decades of social science research. Then, we apply the taxonomy to automatically generate persuasive adversarial prompts (PAP) to jailbreak LLMs. Results show that persuasion significantly increases the jailbreak risk across all risk categories: PAP consistently achieves an attack success rate of over 92% on Llama-2-7b-Chat, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 in 10 trials, surpassing recent algorithm-focused attacks. On the defense side, we explore various mechanisms against PAP, find a significant gap in existing defenses, and advocate for more fundamental solutions for AI safety. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize industries and transform societal operations, yet public apprehension concerning its risks poses a significant barrier to its adoption. This research leverages behavior change theories to develop strategies that mitigate perceived risks and address ethical concerns surrounding AI. By investigating the psychological underpinnings of AI-related fears and implementing intervention scenarios, this study aims to enhance informed decision-making and promote informed acceptance and ethical judgment of AI. Through a comparative analysis involving participants from the United Kingdom (UK) and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the research seeks to uncover demographic and cultural factors influencing perceptions of AI risks and ethics. The findings are expected to provide actionable recommendations for AI developers, policymakers, and stakeholders, focusing on transparency, ethical practices, and public trust in AI technologies. This study contributes to the broader discourse on responsible AI adoption, offering insights that could influence both academic research and practical applications in the field. As a potential approach, Inoculation Theory can be utilized within this framework to further understand and address AI-related concerns.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The persuasiveness of a virtual agent refers to its ability to influence, persuade, or motivate users to take specific actions or adopt certain attitudes or beliefs. Virtual agents can use its multimodal capabilities, including non-verbal cues to enhance their persuasiveness. In this paper, we present a new tool called THRUST (from neuTral Human face to peRsUaSive virTual face) to automatically generate the head movements and facial expressions of a persuasive virtual character. This tool is based on a machine learning approach from a human videos corpus to identify the non-verbal persuasive cues. A convolution-based model then transforms neutral non-verbal behavior to a persuasive non-verbal behavior simulated on a virtual face. Videos generated by the tool have been evaluated through a subjective perceptive study with about 90 participants. The results show that the virtual agent’s head and facial behaviors generated by the THRUST tool are perceived as persuasive, thus validating the proposed approach. © 2024, Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Since the early studies exploring the use of SMS text messaging for health intervention, text messaging has played a pivotal role in the advancement of mobile health. As an intervention modality, text messaging has provided vital learnings for the design and delivery of interventions, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite the advances in technology over the last 25 years, text messaging is still being used in largely the same way to deliver health information, behavior change interventions, and support. The strong, consistent evidence for the benefits of this type of intervention has made text messaging a routine part of health interventions around the world. Key to its success is its simplicity, alongside the benefit of being arguably the most accessible form of consumer digital health intervention. Text message interventions are well suited for public health interventions due to their low cost, vast reach, frequent use, high read rates, and ability to be tailored and personalized. Furthermore, the nature of text messaging interventions makes them ideal for the delivery of multilingual, culturally tailored interventions, which is important in the context of increasing cultural diversity in many countries internationally. Indeed, studies assessing text message–based health interventions have shown them to be effective across sociodemographic and ethnic groups and have led to their adoption into national-level health promotion programs. With a growing focus on artificial intelligence, robotics, sensors, and other advances in digital health, there is an opportunity to integrate these technologies into text messaging programs. Simultaneously, it is essential that equity remains at the forefront for digital health researchers, developers, and implementers. Ensuring digital health solutions address inequities in health experienced across the world while taking action to maximize digital inclusion will ensure the true potential of digital health is realized. Text messaging has the potential to continue to play a pivotal role in the delivery of equitable digital health tools to communities around the world for many years to come. Further new technologies can build on the humble text message, leveraging its success to advance the field of digital health. This Viewpoint presents a retrospective of text messaging in health, drawing on the example of text message–based interventions for smoking cessation, and presents evidence for the continued relevance of this mobile health modality in 2025 and beyond. ©Rosie Dobson, Robyn Whittaker, Lorien C Abroms, Dale Bramley, Caroline Free, Hayden McRobbie, Melanie Stowell, Anthony Rodgers.

AB  - Evidence shows that physical inactivity is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. A growing variety of behavioural change interventions have been developed to promote physical activity behaviour, and have shown success. However, most of these apps apply a one-size-fits-all approach focusing on individualistic cultures and neglecting collectivist cultures. We investigate the possible cultural differences between individualism and collectivism on how the behavioral determinants influence people’s physical activity behaviour. We conducted a large-scale study of 430 participants from collectivist and individualist cultures using the extended Health Belief Model (HBM). We also assess the moderating effect of age and gender. We map these determinants to their corresponding persuasive strategies that can be used in operationalizing them in behaviour change applications for promoting physical activity. Our findings show that Social influence and Cue to action are the strongest determinants of physical activity for collectivists. Whereas in individualists, Cue to action, and Self-efficacy are the strongest determinants of physical activity. Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings and offer design guidelines for persuasive interventions that both appeal to a broad audience and are tailored to a particular group depending on their gender and age group. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: OpenAI's ChatGPT is a source of advanced online health information (OHI) that may be integrated into individuals' health information-seeking routines. However, concerns have been raised about its factual accuracy and impact on health outcomes. To forecast implications for medical practice and public health, more information is needed on who uses the tool, how often, and for what. Objective: This study aims to characterize the reasons for and types of ChatGPT OHI use and describe the users most likely to engage with the platform. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, patients received invitations to participate via the ResearchMatch platform, a nonprofit affiliate of the National Institutes of Health. A web-based survey measured demographic characteristics, use of ChatGPT and other sources of OHI, experience characterization, and resultant health behaviors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Both 2-tailed t tests and Pearson chi-square tests were used to compare users of ChatGPT OHI to nonusers. Results: Of 2406 respondents, 21.5% (n=517) respondents reported using ChatGPT for OHI. ChatGPT users were younger than nonusers (32.8 vs 39.1 years, P< .001) with lower advanced degree attainment (BA or higher; 49.9% vs 67%, P< .001) and greater use of transient health care (ED and urgent care; P< .001). ChatGPT users were more avid consumers of general non-ChatGPT OHI (percentage of weekly or greater OHI seeking frequency in past 6 months, 28.2% vs 22.8%, P< .001). Around 39.3% (n=206) respondents endorsed using the platform for OHI 2-3 times weekly or more, and most sought the tool to determine if a consultation was required (47.4%, n=245) or to explore alternative treatment (46.2%, n=239). Use characterization was favorable as many believed ChatGPT to be just as or more useful than other OHIs (87.7%, n=429) and their doctor (81%, n=407). About one-third of respondents requested a referral (35.6%, n=184) or changed medications (31%, n=160) based on the information received from ChatGPT. As many users reported skepticism regarding the ChatGPT output (67.9%, n=336), most turned to their physicians (67.5%, n=349). Conclusions: This study underscores the significant role of AI-generated OHI in shaping health-seeking behaviors and the potential evolution of patient-provider interactions. Given the proclivity of these users to enact health behavior changes based on AI-generated content, there is an opportunity for physicians to guide ChatGPT OHI users on an informed and examined use of the technology. © Oluwatobiloba Ayo-Ajibola, Ryan J Davis, Matthew E Lin, Jeffrey Riddell, Richard L Kravitz.

AB  - As global populations continue to age and chronic health conditions rise, the demand for scalable, effective rehabilitation interventions is increasing. Digital interventions offer a cost-effective solution for promoting healthy behavior change and self-management. However, traditional methods of handcrafting structured intervention content are time-inefficient, and not scalable. We propose a new approach to content structuring by modeling it as an automated planning problem. This work introduces the Automated Planning of LEvel Systems (APLES) tool, which leverages automated planning to generate structured intervention content within predefined constraints, balancing automation and designer control. APLES addresses the limitations of existing solutions such as Procedural Content Generation (PCG) systems, which often limit creative input. APLES allows designers to set rules that guide the automated processes. In this work-in-progress paper, we describe the technical progress of the APLES tool, including its planning framework and practical application in digital health interventions. Preliminary results demonstrate the tool’s potential to improve efficiency and scalability in content structuring while maintaining alignment with creative goals. In future work, we will evaluate APLES across multiple digital interventions to assess its impact on user engagement compared to structures handcrafted by campaign managers, and its perceived usefulness by healthcare providers. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - This study investigates how the level of physical anthropomorphism in conversational agents affects their persuasiveness. The experiment compared robots with low and high levels of anthropomorphism, akin to human appearance. Results indicated that while sophisticated physical embodiment did not universally enhance persuasiveness, it did have an interaction effect based on issue involvement. For low involvement issues, persuasiveness increased with higher anthropomorphism. In contrast, for high involvement issues, persuasiveness remained constant across different levels of anthropomorphism but dropped when robots closely resembled humans, possibly due to trust in high-tech robots. The findings highlight the importance of digital agent's persuasive power and ethics in employing and designing robots.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Chatbots, or conversational agents, have emerged as significant tools in health care, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and digital technology. These programs are designed to simulate human conversations, addressing various health care needs. However, no comprehensive synthesis of health care chatbots' roles, users, benefits, and limitations is available to inform future research and application in the field. Objective: This review aims to describe health care chatbots' characteristics, focusing on their diverse roles in the health care pathway, user groups, benefits, and limitations. Methods: A rapid review of published literature from 2017 to 2023 was performed with a search strategy developed in collaboration with a health sciences librarian and implemented in the MEDLINE and Embase databases. Primary research studies reporting on chatbot roles or benefits in health care were included. Two reviewers dual-screened the search results. Extracted data on chatbot roles, users, benefits, and limitations were subjected to content analysis. Results: The review categorized chatbot roles into 2 themes: delivery of remote health services, including patient support, care management, education, skills building, and health behavior promotion, and provision of administrative assistance to health care providers. User groups spanned across patients with chronic conditions as well as patients with cancer; individuals focused on lifestyle improvements; and various demographic groups such as women, families, and older adults. Professionals and students in health care also emerged as significant users, alongside groups seeking mental health support, behavioral change, and educational enhancement. The benefits of health care chatbots were also classified into 2 themes: improvement of health care quality and efficiency and cost-effectiveness in health care delivery. The identified limitations encompassed ethical challenges, medicolegal and safety concerns, technical difficulties, user experience issues, and societal and economic impacts. Conclusions: Health care chatbots offer a wide spectrum of applications, potentially impacting various aspects of health care. While they are promising tools for improving health care efficiency and quality, their integration into the health care system must be approached with consideration of their limitations to ensure optimal, safe, and equitable use.  ©Moustafa Laymouna, Yuanchao Ma, David Lessard, Tibor Schuster, Kim Engler, Bertrand Lebouché.

AB  - Objective: This pilot study aimed to evaluate the usability and effectiveness of a behavior change technique (BCT)-based chatbot developed to promote healthier beverage consumption among adolescents. Methods: The Read and Manage your health roBot (“R-Ma Bot”), designed with 13 BCTs, was tested with 42 adolescents (13 men, 29 women, mean age 15.0 ± 0.7) for 2 weeks. Usability was assessed after the 2-week intervention using a chatbot usability questionnaire, recruitment, retention, participation, and engagement. Scores above 70 out of 100 were considered high usability. Qualitative data from open-ended questions were collected for evaluation. Effectiveness was measured by changes in knowledge, use and impact of nutrition labels, and weekly consumption of sugar, sodium, and caffeine from carbonated and/or energy drinks before and after the 2-week intervention. Results: The score of R-Ma Bot's usability averaged 74.7, with participants addressing it useful, friendly, and easy to use, though they suggested improving unnatural conversation flow. All participants engaged with the chatbot for at least 13 out of 14 days, with over half using it daily for the entire period. After intervention, awareness of nutrition labels increased from 64.3% to 92.9%, and nonreaders decreased from 42.9% to 16.7%. Weekly sugar intake from beverages significantly decreased by 60%, from 13.1 ± 20.1 mg to 7.9 ± 12.8 mg. Conclusions: R-Ma Bot's high usability contributed to high retention and behavioral changes, significantly reduced sugar consumption from beverages and improved awareness of nutrition labels. We suggest integrating strategies that enhance knowledge, motivation, and opportunities through BCTs with youth-friendly design elements in the development of interventions for adolescents. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The authors introduce a Skills Awareness Framework for Learning Design (SAFLD) to provide guiding principles for learning. Corporate learning is in a state of flux due to disruptive influences such as COVID-19 and the digitalization of the world of work, even into the home office. In the age of generative AI where knowledge is seemingly available at the touch of a button, corporate learning is more than ever challenged to re-focus on teaching critical and relevant skills. Therefore, in the sense of self-reflection, it will be discussed that learning in the moment will still need to be complemented by experiences that change behaviors. These include both cognitive and motor skills and are based on inter- and intra-action of learners and trainers both individually and as a team. When it comes to re-focusing experiential learning towards skills that matter most, learning factories, e.g., the Innovation and Learning Centers or Model-Factories-in-a-Box, play an even more important role than ever before. This hypothesis is supported by Bloom’s taxonomy which classifies learning objectives and illustrates that some skills or higher proficiency levels of skills might be acquired by digital, self-paced e-learning or by virtual, instructor-led learning sessions, whereas other skills or higher proficiency levels of skills and deep learning that change behavior might be better acquired by experiential learning. Finally, learning factories can also play a role in bringing the emerging GenAI to life in an application-oriented environment such as a shop floor. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Background: Singapore, like the rest of Asia, faces persistent challenges to mental health promotion, including stigma around unwellness and seeking treatment and a lack of trained mental health personnel. The COVID-19 pandemic, which created a surge in mental health care needs and simultaneously accelerated the adoption of digital health solutions, revealed a new opportunity to quickly scale innovative solutions in the region. Objective: In June 2020, the Singaporean government launched mindline.sg, an anonymous digital mental health resource website that has grown to include >500 curated local mental health resources, a clinically validated self-assessment tool for depression and anxiety, an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot from Wysa designed to deliver digital therapeutic exercises, and a tailored version of the website for working adults called mindline at work. The goal of the platform is to empower Singapore residents to take charge of their own mental health and to be able to offer basic support to those around them through the ease and convenience of a barrier-free digital solution. Methods: Website use is measured through click-level data analytics captured via Google Analytics and custom application programming interfaces, which in turn drive a customized analytics infrastructure based on the open-source platforms Titanium Database and Metabase. Unique, nonbounced (users that do not immediately navigate away from the site), engaged, and return users are reported. Results: In the 2 years following launch (July 1, 2020, through June 30, 2022), the website received >447,000 visitors (approximately 15% of the target population of 3 million), 62.02% (277,727/447,783) of whom explored the site or engaged with resources (referred to as nonbounced visitors); 10.54% (29,271/277,727) of those nonbounced visitors returned. The most popular features on the platform were the dialogue-based therapeutic exercises delivered by the chatbot and the self-assessment tool, which were used by 25.54% (67,626/264,758) and 11.69% (32,469/277,727) of nonbounced visitors. On mindline at work, the rates of nonbounced visitors who engaged extensively (ie, spent ≥40 seconds exploring resources) and who returned were 51.56% (22,474/43,588) and 13.43% (5,853/43,588) over a year, respectively, compared to 30.9% (42,829/138,626) and 9.97% (13,822/138,626), respectively, on the generic mindline.sg site in the same year. Conclusions: The site has achieved desired reach and has seen a strong growth rate in the number of visitors, which required substantial and sustained digital marketing campaigns and strategic outreach partnerships. The site was careful to preserve anonymity, limiting the detail of analytics. The good levels of overall adoption encourage us to believe that mild to moderate mental health conditions and the social factors that underly them are amenable to digital interventions. While mindline.sg was primarily used in Singapore, we believe that similar solutions with local customization are widely and globally applicable. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - AI conversational agents are increasingly prevalent in marketing practices. A recent effort to make AI conversational agents humanlike is the use of conversational fillers, such as uh, um, and hmm. While computer science research has shown that conversational fillers used by AI agents generally improve users’ interactional experiences, their effects in marketing remain unexplored. This research examines AI conversational fillers in a sales and promotion context and shows that they trigger consumers’ suspicion of ulterior motives, thereby decreasing their purchase intentions, an effect moderated by organization type (for-profit vs. nonprofit). We conducted one field experiment and four online experiments with different modalities, products, and languages to provide empirical support for the hypotheses. In so doing, this research contributes to the research on chatbot natural language and AI persuasion by showing that the persuasion knowledge model can come into work in consumers’ interaction with AI agents. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: The growing importance of sustainability has led to the current literature being saturated with studies on the necessity of, and suggested topics for, education for sustainable health care (ESH). Even so, ESH implementation has been hindered by educator unpreparedness and resource scarcity. A potential resolution lies in virtual education. However, research on the strategies needed for successfully implementing virtual education in the context of sustainable health care and medical education is sparse; this study aims to fill the gap. Methods: Topic modelling, a computational text-mining method for analysing recurring patterns of co-occurring word clusters to reveal key topics prevalent across the texts, was used to examine how sustainability was addressed in research in medicine, medical education, and virtual education. A total of 17 631 studies, retrieved from Web of Science, Scopus and PubMed, were analysed. Results: Sustainability-related topics within health care, medical education and virtual education provided systematic implications for Sustainable Virtual Medical Education (SVME)–ESH via virtual platforms in a sustainable way. Analyses of keywords, phrases, topics and their associated networks indicate that SVME should address the three pillars of environmental, social and economic sustainability and medical practices to uphold them; employ different technologies and methods including simulations, virtual reality (VR), artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, distance learning; and implement strategies for collaborative development, persuasive diffusion and quality assurance. Conclusions: This research suggests that sustainable strategies in virtual education for ESH require a systems approach, encompassing components such as learning content and objectives, evaluation, targeted learners, media, methods and strategies. The advancement of SVME necessitates that medical educators and researchers play a central and bridging role, guiding both the fields of sustainable health care and medical education in the development and implementation of SVME. In this way, they can prepare future physicians to address sustainability issues that impact patient care. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Recent evolutions in the accessibility and uptake of generative AI tools have already affected the way design and engineering are taught at university level. The exploration of AI related tools and technologies is increasingly part of formal design study and informal and peer learning. It is however important to place recent evolutions in a longer temporal context. Design activity and education have seen a progressive move away from “thing-based” methods and towards capability, service, experience, and systemic approaches; considering the wider context and impact of design interventions. These evolutions in design and design education create a learning environment where the abstract, virtual and experiential are, in some cases, more present than the material and tangible. This paper proposes a discussion on the importance of addressing materiality and tangible everyday material experience in this evolving context. This paper presents two different “families” of teaching modules that have evolved over a period of five years with a focus on materiality, material relations and touch. While these two modules represent different ways of exploring materials and material relations, they together permit reflection around forms of tangible/material learning activities that may be relevant in future design curricula, and the criteria and qualities these forms of teaching may need to incorporate. © 2024 Proceedings of the 26th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Rise of the Machines: Design Education in the Generative AI Era, E and PDE 2024.

AB  - The traditional broadcast TV viewing experience has barely evolved since its inception, remaining mostly static despite many technical advances. Smart TVs show attempts of filling this gap, but present challenges, such as limiting functionalities to specific models and lack of standardization. Privacy concerns arise as smart TVs connect to advertising and monitoring services. In the spectrum of interactivity, an option that stands out is affective computing, an interdisciplinary field that seeks to develop systems capable of recognizing, expressing and responding to human emotions. This work proposes the incorporation of affective computing techniques and concepts to improve the experience and interactivity with digital TV, naming it “Affective TV”. The work presents a modular architecture, recognition modules developed for multiple modes of interaction and a fully operational implementation of the architecture, developed for the standard digital TV middleware in Brazil, Ginga. Affective TV uses audio and video capturing devices and allows users to set up their environments. Recognition modules capture and classify data, communicating directly to the TV middleware. Proof-of-concept applications, incorporating voice and hand pose interactions with facial expression recognition, were evaluated using the GQM. UEQ-S and TAM questionnaires were employed. Very positive results were obtained, including an excellent UEQ rating, showcasing technical feasibility, attractiveness, user experience, perceived usefulness, and ease of use. The proposal enriches the digital TV experience, providing a novel, interactive model with user-centric customization and emotion-driven responses. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The XMM-Newton X-ray space observatory, ESA's second cornerstone of the Horizon 2000 Science Programme, launched in 1999, has been pivotal in unveiling cosmic mysteries. Despite surpassing its intended 10-year lifespan, XMM-Newton continues to excel, with a 6.4 oversubscription factor in 2023. While ground operations have modernized, certain flight dynamics processes remain manual. Weekly procedures for generating and validating mission scheduling files still rely on significant human intervention. Recognizing the need for automation, ESOC's Artificial Intelligence for Automation (A2I) Roadmap identified this use case for further automation through AI. In collaboration with the XMM-Newton flight dynamics team, we developed a solution combining software automation and optimization techniques. This solution transforms engineers' roles from task performers to overseers, optimizing attitude change maneuvers planning and ensuring mission safety. Already operational, this solution positions XMM-Newton as a pioneer in integrating AI into mission operations. We outline the solution's features and capabilities, describe the development and deployment process, and discuss the achieved impact and benefits, highlighting AI's potential to enhance both heritage and future missions.

AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are increasingly being included in digital health and wellbeing programs. Whilst initial evaluations of ECAs in this field have been promising, there has been a lack of detail as to how stakeholders and end users have been included in the design process. Stakeholder inclusion has been acknowledged as essential to ensure that ECAs meet expectations, maximize engagement and facilitate behavior change. This study describes an iterative coproduction process used to develop an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) to support people following injury. The coproduction process followed an accelerated creation approach with 13 qualitative interviews being conducted with people who had a lived experience of recovering from injury/adversity. Interviews were completed with the goal to understand barriers and facilitators to engagement, user experience and to identify opportunities for program improvement. Four broad themes emerged from the data: visual look, voice, content and experience. A key finding from this study was a high level of stakeholder apprehension of generative AI and the need for ECA designers to make explicit the specific technology and functions being used within programs. Findings highlight the value of timely stakeholder inclusion in digital intervention design, particularly when knowledge and expectations of generative technology is rapidly changing. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Although persuasive games are effective at promoting behaviour change, their effectiveness may be influenced by many factors, which include gamer personality type and game framing. This paper explores the relationship between game framing, gamer type and persuasive strategies, focusing on a persuasive game for Healthy Eating. In a between-study of 371 participants, our research revealed that, although the three game-framing versions (gain-framed, loss-framed, and gain-loss-framed) and four persuasive strategies implemented (reward, competition, praise, and suggestion) were perceived as effective, the effectiveness of the reward strategy was significantly different across the game-framing versions. It was more effective in the gain-loss framed version when compared to the other two versions. We also found that the reward strategy had the highest number of significant relationships with the gamer types across all the game framings, while the suggestion strategy showed no significant relationships with the gamer types across all framings. We conclude by discussing the insights from these results and how they affect persuasive game design for game framings and game types. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - The central pressure of power is definitely what drives modern society. Its central role in our lives is plain to see since the smooth operation of electrical infrastructure is fundamental to the functioning of the modern world. These buildings comprise an electrical community that integrates electrical additives in a complex web that allows for green technology, transmission, and power distribution to end users. To synthesize and renovate these strength gadget components, many factors must be carefully considered. Correcting for human error becomes a critical concern in the fabrication of components and the protection of electronic devices in the very precise field of electrical engineering. Innovative solutions to improve efficiency and ensure the reliability of certain equipment are required due to the complicated nature of these duties.

AB  - School textbooks have a profound influence on shaping the thoughts of young individuals. Reducing sex, gender, and race bias in these educational materials is then an imperative social goal. Despite efforts to address bias, historical and contemporary textbooks have been found to perpetuate stereotyped associations: efficient techniques like word embeddings can be used to analyze a wide range of school textbooks to assess the presence of stereotyped biases. In this paper, we use Artificial Intelligence to test what happens if people are exposed to some textbooks or others. Our procedure can be used for in-silico testing of the persuasive power of textbooks. For this purpose, we introduce ChildDM, a model constructed from a corpus of children's free-produced language, and its domain-adapted version, ChildDM-School, trained on a collection of school textbooks. Leveraging the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) framework, we investigate how biases evolve in the language of children after exposition to historical textbooks. While historical textbooks tend to avoid explicit gender-based stereotypes in the scientific and artistic domains, they still conceal biases. Specifically, women are associated with caregiving and family-related activities.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The widespread use of smartphones in the United States has led to a surge in mHealth apps designed to support people with various health issues. Yet the effectiveness and long-term impacts of these apps still need to be determined. This article presents a case study of the development of MyT1DHero, an mHealth app for people with type 1 diabetes, to identify best practices for app development. We propose four essential best practices based on the insights gained from this case study: incorporating theoretical frameworks, prioritizing user feedback, engaging key stakeholders, and establishing a robust data-collection foundation. These findings have practical implications for researchers and developers seeking to create effective mHealth interventions. Furthermore, we suggest future research directions to advance the development and implementation of innovative health technologies. © 2023 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Forensic Perspectives on Cybercrime is the first book to combine the disciplines of cyberpsychology and forensic psychology, helping to define this emergent area. It explores the psychological factors that influence the behaviour of all those involved in cybersecurity, drawing upon the research literatures in relevant areas including forensic, social, and cyberpsychology. Written by leading figures in the field, the book provides an introduction to the cybercrime ecosystem, before discussing the psychological manipulation of targets through social engineering techniques and highlighting the unique threats that this type of attack presents. The reasons why people become involved in hacking are explored, and the authors review research literature on risk factors of being a victim of cybercrime, along with the concept of resilience. Behaviour change and prevention strategies are also evaluated, as well as the role of emergent technologies such as artificial intelligence and what this may mean for the role of humans in cybersecurity. Case studies and real-world examples are woven throughout to illustrate key issues, opportunities, and challenges. This unique text is a must-read for students undertaking any degree that relates to behaviour and cybersecurity, including psychology, computing, law, and business management. It is also highly relevant to researchers, practitioners, and policymakers who work in cybersecurity and/or have an interest in empowering people to be safe online. © 2024 John McAlaney, Peter J.

AB  - If dedicate a lane to connected autonomous vehicle (CAV) on a multilane road, the traffic congestion and safety risks remain a major problem but in a different style. Random and disorderly mandatory lane-changing behaviour before approaching the next ramp or intersection would have a disturbing effect on the following vehicles of the traffic flow. This paper mainly establishes the optimal mandatory lane-changing location matching model for each target vehicle in the dedicated CAV lane environment. The aim is to minimizing the total travel time, which could take the disturbing effect into account. This model nests the cell transmission model (CTM) to describe vehicle running. The constraints include the relation between target CAV lane-changing cell and the corresponding behaviour start time, the updating of the flow, and occupancy for varied cells. We use the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to solve the problem. Through the case study of a basic two-lane road scenario in Ningbo, we acquire the convergence results based on the ACO algorithm. Our optimal lane-changing location matching scheme can save 5.9% total travel time when compared to the near-end location lane-changing scheme. We test our model by increasing the total number of upstream input vehicles with 4%, 11%, 15%, and the mandatory lane-changing vehicles with 60%, 200%, respectively. The testing results prove that out optimization method could deal with varied road traffic flow situations. Specifically, when the traffics and mandatory lane-changing vehicles increase, our method could perform better.  © 2024 Gao Gao et al.

AB  - Background: As global populations age and become susceptible to neurodegenerative illnesses, new therapies for Alzheimer disease (AD) are urgently needed. Existing data resources for drug discovery and repurposing fail to capture relationships central to the disease’s etiology and response to drugs. Objective: We designed the Alzheimer’s Knowledge Base (AlzKB) to alleviate this need by providing a comprehensive knowledge representation of AD etiology and candidate therapeutics. Methods: We designed the AlzKB as a large, heterogeneous graph knowledge base assembled using 22 diverse external data sources describing biological and pharmaceutical entities at different levels of organization (eg, chemicals, genes, anatomy, and diseases). AlzKB uses a Web Ontology Language 2 ontology to enforce semantic consistency and allow for ontological inference. We provide a public version of AlzKB and allow users to run and modify local versions of the knowledge base. Results: AlzKB is freely available on the web and currently contains 118,902 entities with 1,309,527 relationships between those entities. To demonstrate its value, we used graph data science and machine learning to (1) propose new therapeutic targets based on similarities of AD to Parkinson disease and (2) repurpose existing drugs that may treat AD. For each use case, AlzKB recovers known therapeutic associations while proposing biologically plausible new ones. Conclusions: AlzKB is a new, publicly available knowledge resource that enables researchers to discover complex translational associations for AD drug discovery. Through 2 use cases, we show that it is a valuable tool for proposing novel therapeutic hypotheses based on public biomedical knowledge. ©Joseph D Romano, Van Truong, Rachit Kumar, Mythreye Venkatesan, Britney E Graham, Yun Hao, Nick Matsumoto, Xi Li, Zhiping Wang, Marylyn D Ritchie, Li Shen, Jason H Moore.

AB  - Background: The importance of computational psychotherapy is increasing due to the record high prevalence of mental health issues worldwide. Despite advancements, current computational psychotherapy systems lack advanced prediction and behavior change mechanisms using conversational agents. Purpose: This work presents a computational psychotherapy system for mental health prediction and behavior change using a conversational agent. It makes two major contributions. First, we introduce a novel, golden standard dataset, comprising panel data with 1495 instances of quantitative stress, anxiety, and depression (SAD) symptom scores from diagnostic-level questionnaires and qualitative daily diary entries. Second, we present the computational psychotherapy system itself. Hypothesis: We hypothesize that simulating a theory of mind-the human cognitive ability to understand others – in a conversational agent enhances its effectiveness in relieving mental health issues. Methods: The system simulates theory of mind with a cognitive architecture comprising an ensemble of computational models, using cognitive modelling and machine learning models trained on the novel dataset, and novel ontologies. The system was evaluated through a computational experiment on mental health phenomena prediction from text, and an empirical interventional study on relieving mental health issues in 42 participants. Results: The system outperformed state-of-the-art systems in terms of the number of detected categories and detection accuracy (highest accuracy: 91.41% using k-nearest neighbors (kNN); highest accuracy of other systems: 84% using long-short term memory network (LSTM)). The highest accuracy for 7-day forecasting was 87.68%, whereas the other systems were not able to forecast trends. In the study, the system outperformed Woebot, the current state-of-the-art, in reducing stress (p = 0.004) and anxiety (p = 0.008) levels. Conclusion: The confirmation of our hypothesis indicates that incorporating theory of mind simulation in conversational agents significantly enhances their efficacy in computational psychotherapy, offering a promising advancement for mental health interventions and support compared to current state-of-the-art systems. © 2024 Kolenik et al.

AB  - Climate change is undeniable. The drastic consequences it may have on our lives make a collective effort crucial. Our research explores how Conversational Agents (CAs) can persuade people into environmentally sustainable behaviors, particularly in domestic spaces where these technologies are becoming increasingly popular. In this research work, we conducted an empirical evaluation (N=29) exploring the effectiveness and stance towards the adoption of different persuasive strategies compared to a CA delivering messages referring to just one persuasion strategy. Furthermore, this contribution reports on a custom dialogue manager's implementation, designed to enable the execution of the experiment. Although study results suggested no significant difference in persuasion effectiveness and usability of the conversational agents, participants reported a significant difference in the perceptions of parasocial interactions and dialogue with the CA, preferring the one delivering multiple persuasive strategies. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - Goal-setting is commonly used in behavior change applications for physical activity. However, for goals to be effective, they need to be tailored to a user’s situation (e.g., motivation, progress). One way to obtain such goals is a collaborative process in which a healthcare professional and client set a goal together, thus making use of the professional’s expertise and the client’s knowledge about their own situation. As healthcare professionals are not always available, we created a dialog with the virtual coach Steph to collaboratively set daily step goals. Since judgments in human decision-making processes are adjusted based on the starting point or anchor, the first step goal proposal Steph makes is likely to influence the user’s final goal and self-efficacy. Situational factors impacting physical activity (e.g., motivation, self-efficacy, available time) or how users process information (e.g., mood) may determine which initial proposals are most effective in getting users to reach their underlying previous activity-based recommended step goals. Using data from 117 people interacting with Steph for up to five days, we designed a reinforcement learning algorithm that considers users’ current and future situations when choosing an initial step goal proposal. Our simulations show that initial step goal proposals matter: choosing optimal ones based on this algorithm could make it more likely that people move to a situation with high motivation, high self-efficacy, and a favorable daily context. Then, they are more likely to achieve, but also to overachieve, their underlying recommended step goals. Our dataset is publicly available. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Mobile health apps are becoming popular and capable of addressing a wide range of health-related issues including stress. In this study, we designed, developed, and evaluated an mHealth application called SmileApp to promote positive mood as a means of reducing stress. The design of SmileApp is grounded in psychological theories and integrates artificial intelligence (AI) and persuasive technology (PT). To evaluate SmileApp, we conducted a two-week in-the-wild study involving 72 participants. This was followed by an optional semi-structured interview with 23 participants. Quantitative results suggest that SmileApp is usable, and the use of the features can convince users to smile more frequently, as well as feel a sense of companionship and connectedness. Furthermore, qualitative results suggest that SmileApp was a unique design to help users alleviate stress. These results offer valuable insights into innovative approaches for designing mHealth applications that promote positive mood. Moreover, the findings underscore the importance of utilizing technology to support emotional wellbeing. We present a novel approach to promote desired behaviors by motivating users to read supportive messages and play mobile games by smiling. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Health care is under pressure due to an aging population with an increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease. Smoking and physical inactivity are 2 key preventable risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Yet, as with most health behaviors, they are difficult to change. In the interdisciplinary Perfect Fit project, scientists from different fields join forces to develop an evidence-based virtual coach (VC) that supports smokers in quitting smoking and increasing their physical activity. In this Viewpoint paper, intervention content, design, and implementation, as well as lessons learned, are presented to support other research groups working on similar projects. A total of 6 different approaches were used and combined to support the development of the Perfect Fit VC. The approaches used are (1) literature reviews, (2) empirical studies, (3) collaboration with end users, (4) content and technical development sprints, (5) interdisciplinary collaboration, and (6) iterative proof-of-concept implementation. The Perfect Fit intervention integrates evidence-based behavior change techniques with new techniques focused on identity change, big data science, sensor technology, and personalized real-time coaching. Intervention content of the virtual coaching matches the individual needs of the end users. Lessons learned include ways to optimally implement and tailor interactions with the VC (eg, clearly explain why the user is asked for input and tailor the timing and frequency of the intervention components). Concerning the development process, lessons learned include strategies for effective interdisciplinary collaboration and technical development (eg, finding a good balance between end users’ wishes and legal possibilities). The Perfect Fit development process was collaborative, iterative, and challenging at times. Our experiences and lessons learned can inspire and benefit others. Advanced, evidence-based digital interventions, such as Perfect Fit, can contribute to a healthy society while alleviating health care burden. ©Anke Versluis, Kristell M Penfornis, Sven A van der Burg, Bouke L Scheltinga, Milon H M van Vliet, Nele Albers, Eline Meijer.

AB  - Given proper facilitation, pro-environmental behaviour in tourist destinations may spill over to the daily lives of tourists. Recent advancements in conversational artificial intelligence (AI) may lead to the emergence of more effective technology that will encourage people to become more environmentally friendly. However, limited research has been devoted to understanding the complexity of using such technologies for pro-social nudging. This study applies rigorous scale development procedures to test how advanced conversational AI, like chatbots, can be effective in encouraging pro-environmental behaviour spillover. The conceptual model introduces seven factors that predict people’s intention to use the chatbot and three factors that predict their intention to embrace the target behaviour. Performance expectancy and timing were the most significant in predicting the intention of individuals to adopt the technology. Efficiency and government support were the chief drivers of the intention to adopt pro-environmental behaviour. The findings suggest that although introducing a technology-mediated nudging mechanism can trigger people’s intention to behave pro-environmentally, other factors must be fulfilled in order to ensure sustained behaviour change in society. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Stress in the workplace and the resulting disorders present a significant challenge for the employee, employer, and national economy. According to the transactional model of stress, a possible reduction in stress can be achieved by reevaluating the situation. According to the social response theory, conversational agents should be very suitable for this task, as their increased persuasiveness leads to increased confidence of the user in their abilities. However, the perception of a social agent could also present an additional source of social evaluation stress, i.e., feeling observed and judged by another person. We propose a NeuroIS experiment utilizing EEG, ECG, and eye-tracking to resolve those opposing predictions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Online health misinformation carries serious social and public health implications. A growing prevalence of sophisticated online health misinformation employs advanced persuasive tactics, making misinformation discernment progressively more challenging. Enhancing media literacy is a key approach to improving the ability to discern misinformation. The objective of the current study was to examine the feasibility of using generative AI to dissect persuasive tactics as a media literacy scaffolding tool to facilitate online health misinformation discernment. In a mixed 3 (media literacy tool: control vs. National Library of Medicine [NLM] checklist vs. ChatGPT tool) × 2 (information type: true information vs. misinformation) × 2 (information evaluation difficulty: hard vs. easy) online experiment, we found that using dissecting persuasive strategies of ChatGPT can be equally effective when compared with the NLM checklist, and that information type was a significant moderator such that the ChatGPT tool was more effective in helping people identify true information than misinformation. However, the ChatGPT tool performed worse than control in terms of helping people discern misinformation. No difference was found in terms of perceived usefulness and future use intention of the ChatGPT tool and the NLM checklist. The results suggest that more interactive or conversational features might enhance usefulness of ChatGPT as a media literacy tool. Copyright © 2024 Peng, Meng and Ling.

AB  - Transformation is inevitable, as it drives innovation, compels adaptation, and fosters resilience in changing circumstances. Embracing transformation allows individuals and organizations to remain competitive. Recent technological advancements and artificial intelligence (AI) accelerate the transformation efforts, thus giving a significant boost to performance. Such conditions require corporations and social leadership to master transformation. To become the drivers of change instead of remaining desperate followers. Therefore, this paper provides a science-driven methodology and practical tools for achieving hyper-performance. The Transformation Design Framework (TDF) empowers organizations and societies to create technology-driven innovations that make behavioral and attitudinal changes last. Managers can now integrate the hyper-performance methodology to transform corporations. The most significant gains are possible in areas with larger behavioral components. Inside organizations, those typically relate to human resources and managerial decision-making. Externally, it can be related to digital marketing, customer relations, consumer behavior, and user experience. This paper outlines the hyper-performance methodology, the TDF containing eight applicable tools, an application example, and three case studies deploying this methodology. It demonstrates how transformation is practical and achievable instead of mystical and complicated. Scholars and professionals are encouraged to expand this understanding by deploying the methodology and attaining hyper-performance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Dementia and cognitive impairment remain a major unsolved neuroscience mystery around the global healthcare systems. They are often diagnosed only after the disease has progressed to an advanced stage and starts hampering the daily activities of the individuals. The diagnosis is time-consuming and a series of invasive and non-invasive medical investigations need to be conducted on the patient to arrive at a diagnosis. These examinations and cognitive tests sometimes may fail to give a definitive diagnosis and determine if the dementia is Alzheimer’s disease-related or not. Behavior changes in such aged patients include anxiety, sleep disturbances, irritability, delusions, psychosis, and many similar manifestations of cognitive impairment. Aged care workers are difficult to recruit and retain owing to the difficulties and long-term stress associated with care services for people with dementia. Moreover, diversity in culture and language also weakens the understanding and relationship between care recipients and care workers. The continuing research on artificial intelligence (AI) applications in medical diagnosis and treatment planning is revolutionizing the approach to disease management. Hence for a chronic and intangible disease like dementia, which could be physically and emotionally taxing for both the patients and their caretakers, various AI algorithms and machine learning models could prove promising in early detection, therapy, and care. This article discusses the applications of artificial intelligence and its future scope in the management of neurocognitive impairment and disability. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Digital platforms can improve patient care, including continuity of care across service providers, and improve outcomes. Electronic health records are widely used within clinical services to document clinical care, and specific applications in mental health care include prompts to develop a suicide safety plan, referrals from general practice for specialist consultations, and standardized risk assessment templates. Digital platforms can also enable communication and engagement with service users across their care. Existing technologies such as text messaging have improved outcomes, with new opportunities emerging from novel platforms such as conversational agents. Beyond the use of these platforms for enhancing communication, advances in smartphone sensors are opening the possibility of digital phenotyping as a method of deriving objective measures of behavior. Such techniques can be used for the early detection of behavior changes, but also for measuring treatment response and the identification of novel cohorts with similar behaviors. Regardless of the mode or functionality of a digital platform, consideration of the human factors and user experience are critical to ensure safety and usage uptake. This can be supported by applying existing quality frameworks and end-user and stakeholder engagement, including co-design processes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Short messaging service (SMS) messages or text messages have the potential for high reach at low cost. Using SMS presents an opportunity to deliver health-related information, reminders, and support that provides self-management directly to individuals in a way other mediums cannot. SMS messages are already successfully used as appointment and medication refill reminders. Further research utilizing extant behavioral science knowledge to develop message content could present an opportunity to use SMS to improve broader self-management of diabetes. Machine learning and artificial intelligence could be used to tailor content and identify which populations would derive the most benefit in which contexts. © 2024 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) in chatbots, especially for chronic diseases, has become increasingly prevalent. These AI-powered chatbots serve as crucial tools for enhancing patient communication, addressing the rising prevalence of chronic conditions, and meeting the growing demand for supportive healthcare applications. However, there is a notable gap in comprehensive reviews evaluating the impact of AI-powered chatbot interventions in healthcare within academic literature. This study aimed to assess user satisfaction, intervention efficacy, and the specific characteristics and AI architectures of chatbot systems designed for chronic diseases. Method: A thorough exploration of the existing literature was undertaken by employing diverse databases such as PubMed MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, ACM Digital Library and Scopus. The studies incorporated in this analysis encompassed primary research that employed chatbots or other forms of AI architecture in the context of preventing, treating or rehabilitating chronic diseases. The assessment of bias risk was conducted using Risk of 2.0 Tools. Results: Seven hundred and eighty-four results were obtained, and subsequently, eight studies were found to align with the inclusion criteria. The intervention methods encompassed health education (n = 3), behaviour change theory (n = 1), stress and coping (n = 1), cognitive behavioural therapy (n = 2) and self-care behaviour (n = 1). The research provided valuable insights into the effectiveness and user-friendliness of AI-powered chatbots in handling various chronic conditions. Overall, users showed favourable acceptance of these chatbots for self-managing chronic illnesses. Conclusions: The reviewed studies suggest promising acceptance of AI-powered chatbots for self-managing chronic conditions. However, limited evidence on their efficacy due to insufficient technical documentation calls for future studies to provide detailed descriptions and prioritize patient safety. These chatbots employ natural language processing and multimodal interaction. Subsequent research should focus on evidence-based evaluations, facilitating comparisons across diverse chronic health conditions. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Automatic classification of behaviour change language can enhance conversational agents’ capabilities to adjust their behaviour based on users’ current situations and to encourage individuals to make positive changes. However, the lack of annotated language data of change-seekers hampers the performance of existing classifiers. In this study, we investigate the use of semi-supervised learning (SSL) to classify highly imbalanced texts around behaviour change. We assess the impact of including pseudo-labelled data from various sources and examine the balance between the amount of added pseudo-labelled data and the strictness of the inclusion criteria. Our findings indicate that while adding pseudo-labelled samples to the training data has limited classification impact, it does not significantly reduce performance regardless of the source of these new samples. This reinforces previous findings on the feasibility of applying classifiers trained on behaviour change language to diverse contexts. © 2024 ELRA Language Resource Association: CC BY-NC 4.0.

AB  - The purpose of the study is to understand how message fluency and users’ epistemic justification shift perspectives on AI-driven recruitment. Using the S-O-R as the theoretical foundation, a two-group quasi-experimental design with pretest and posttest measures was carried out among 211 participants to measure their willingness to engage and attitude change. Two major results are gleaned from this study. First, message fluency impacted attitude change. In the fluent condition, participants showed a positive attitude towards the presented information on AI-driven recruitment whereas in the disfluent condition, there was no significant change. Two, users’ epistemic justification determined their willingness to engage with information on AI-driven recruitment and had a positive effect on attitude. This research recommends organizations to maximize message fluency with clear typography, structured layouts, and simplified language for better metacognitive experience. Additionally, organizational leaders can integrate epistemic justification in their processes by including testimony of experts and consensus from multiple sources to ground the information with well-supported evidence. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sensor technologies employed in interventions to enhance patient adherence to inhalation therapy for chronic respiratory diseases, with a particular emphasis on human factors. Sensor-based interventions offer opportunities to improve adherence through monitoring and feedback; however, a deeper understanding of how these technologies interact with patients is essential. Patients and Methods: We conducted a systematic review by searching online databases, including PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Science Direct, and ACM Digital Library, spanning the timeframe from January 2014 to December 2023. Our inclusion criteria focused on studies that employed sensor-based technologies to enhance patient adherence to inhalation therapy. Results: The initial search yielded 1563 results. After a thorough screening process, we selected 37 relevant studies. These sensor-based interventions were organized within a comprehensive HFE framework, including data collection, data processing, system feedback, and system feasibility. The data collection phase comprised person-related, task-related, and physical environment-related data. Various approaches to data processing were employed, encompassing applications for assessing intervention effectiveness, monitoring patient behaviour, and identifying disease risks, while system feedback included reminders and alerts, data visualization, and persuasive features. System feasibility was evaluated based on patient acceptance, usability, and device cost considerations. Conclusion: Sensor-based interventions hold significant promise for improving adherence to inhalation therapy. This review high-lights the necessity of an integrated “person-task-physical environment” system to advance future sensor technologies. By capturing comprehensive data on patient health, device usage patterns, and environmental conditions, this approach enables more personalized and effective adherence support. Key recommendations include standardizing data integration protocols, employing advanced algorithms for insights generation, enhancing interactive visual features for accessibility, integrating persuasive design elements to boost engagement, exploring the advantages of conversational agents, and optimizing experience to increase patient acceptance. © 2024 Ma et al.

AB  - Background: Many people want to build good habits to become healthier, live longer, or become happier but struggle to change their behavior. Gamification can make behavior change easier by awarding points for the desired behavior and deducting points for its omission. Objective: In this study, we introduced a principled mathematical method for determining how many points should be awarded or deducted for the enactment or omission of the desired behavior, depending on when and how often the person has succeeded versus failed to enact it in the past. We called this approach optimized gamification of behavior change. Methods: As a proof of concept, we designed a chatbot that applies our optimized gamification method to help people build healthy water-drinking habits. We evaluated the effectiveness of this gamified intervention in a 40-day field experiment with 1 experimental group (n=43) that used the chatbot with optimized gamification and 2 active control groups for which the chatbot's optimized gamification feature was disabled. For the first control group (n=48), all other features were available, including verbal feedback. The second control group (n=51) received no feedback or reminders. We measured the strength of all participants' water-drinking habits before, during, and after the intervention using the Self-Report Habit Index and by asking participants on how many days of the previous week they enacted the desired habit. In addition, all participants provided daily reports on whether they enacted their water-drinking intention that day. Results: A Poisson regression analysis revealed that, during the intervention, users who received feedback based on optimized gamification enacted the desired behavior more often (mean 14.71, SD 6.57 times) than the active (mean 11.64, SD 6.38 times; P< .001; incidence rate ratio=0.80, 95% CI 0.71-0.91) or passive (mean 11.64, SD 5.43 times; P= .001; incidence rate ratio=0.78, 95% CI 0.69-0.89) control groups. The Self-Report Habit Index score significantly increased in all conditions (P< .001 in all cases) but did not differ between the experimental and control conditions (P > .11 in all cases). After the intervention, the experimental group performed the desired behavior as often as the 2 control groups (P≥.17 in all cases). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that optimized gamification can be used to make digital behavior change interventions more effective.

AB  - Background: Our prototype smoking cessation chatbot, Quin, provides evidence-based, personalized support delivered via a smartphone app to help people quit smoking. We developed Quin using a multiphase program of co-design research, part of which included focus group evaluation of Quin among stakeholders prior to clinical testing. Objective: This study aimed to gather and compare feedback on the user experience of the Quin prototype from end users and smoking cessation professionals (SCPs) via a beta testing process to inform ongoing chatbot iterations and refinements. Methods: Following active and passive recruitment, we conducted web-based focus groups with SCPs and end users from Queensland, Australia. Participants tested the app for 1-2 weeks prior to focus group discussion and could also log conversation feedback within the app. Focus groups of SCPs were completed first to review the breadth and accuracy of information, and feedback was prioritized and implemented as major updates using Agile processes prior to end user focus groups. We categorized logged in-app feedback using content analysis and thematically analyzed focus group transcripts. Results: In total, 6 focus groups were completed between August 2022 and June 2023; 3 for SCPs (n=9 participants) and 3 for end users (n=7 participants). Four SCPs had previously smoked, and most end users currently smoked cigarettes (n=5), and 2 had quit smoking. The mean duration of focus groups was 58 (SD 10.9; range 46-74) minutes. We identified four major themes from focus group feedback: (1) conversation design, (2) functionality, (3) relationality and anthropomorphism, and (4) role as a smoking cessation support tool. In response to SCPs’ feedback, we made two major updates to Quin between cohorts: (1) improvements to conversation flow and (2) addition of the “Moments of Crisis” conversation tree. Participant feedback also informed 17 recommendations for future smoking cessation chatbot developments. Conclusions: Feedback from end users and SCPs highlighted the importance of chatbot functionality, as this underpinned Quin’s conversation design and relationality. The ready accessibility of accurate cessation information and impartial support that Quin provided was recognized as a key benefit for end users, the latter of which contributed to a feeling of accountability to the chatbot. Findings will inform the ongoing development of a mature prototype for clinical testing. ©Hollie Bendotti, Sheleigh Lawler, David Ireland, Coral Gartner, Henry M Marshall.

AB  - Visual misinformation poses unique challenges to public health due to its potential for persuasiveness and rapid spread on social media. In this article, librarians at the University of Pittsburgh Health Sciences Library System identify four types of visual health misinformation: misleading graphs and charts, out of context visuals, image manipulation in scientific publications, and AI-generated images and videos. To educate our campus’s health sciences audience and wider community on these topics, we have developed a range of instruction about visual health misinformation. We describe our strategies and provide suggestions for implementing visual misinformation programming for a variety of audiences. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper presents the iterative development of Habit Coach, a GPT-based chatbot designed to support users in habit change through personalized interaction. Employing a user-centered design approach, we developed the chatbot using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, which enables behavior personalization without retraining the underlying language model (GPT-4). The system leverages document retrieval and specialized prompts to tailor interactions, drawing from Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and narrative therapy techniques. A key challenge in the development process was the difficulty of translating declarative knowledge into effective interaction behaviors. In the initial phase, the chatbot was provided with declarative knowledge about CBT via reference textbooks and high-level conversational goals. However, this approach resulted in imprecise and inefficient behavior, as the GPT model struggled to convert static information into dynamic and contextually appropriate interactions. This highlighted the limitations of relying solely on declarative knowledge to guide chatbot behavior, particularly in nuanced, therapeutic conversations. Over four iterations, we addressed this issue by gradually transitioning towards procedural knowledge, refining the chatbot's interaction strategies and improving its overall effectiveness. In the final evaluation, 5 participants engaged with the chatbot over five consecutive days, receiving individualized CBT interventions. The Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI) was used to measure habit strength before and after the intervention, revealing a reduction in habit strength post-intervention. These results underscore the importance of procedural knowledge in driving effective, personalized behavior change support in RAG-based systems. © 2024 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Research suggests participant engagement is a key mediator of mHealth alcohol interventions’ effectiveness in reducing alcohol consumption among users. Understanding the features that promote engagement is critical to maximizing the effectiveness of mHealth-delivered alcohol interventions. The purpose of this study was to identify facilitators and barriers to mHealth alcohol intervention utilization among hazardous-drinking participants who were randomized to use either an app (Step Away) or Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbot-based intervention for reducing drinking (the Step Away chatbot). We conducted semi-structured interviews from December 2019 to January 2020 with 20 participants who used the app or chatbot for three months, identifying common facilitators and barriers to use. Participants of both interventions reported that tracking their drinking, receiving feedback about their drinking, feeling held accountable, notifications about high-risk drinking times, and reminders to track their drinking promoted continued engagement. Positivity, personalization, gaining insight into their drinking, and daily tips were stronger facilitator themes among bot users, indicating these may be strengths of the AI chatbot-based intervention when compared to a user-directed app. While tracking drinking was a theme among both groups, it was more salient among app users, potentially due to the option to quickly track drinks in the app that was not present with the conversational chatbot. Notification glitches, technology glitches, and difficulty with tracking drinking data were usage barriers for both groups. Lengthy setup processes were a stronger barrier for app users. Repetitiveness of the bot conversation, receipt of non-tailored daily tips, and inability to self-navigate to desired content were reported as barriers by bot users. To maximize engagement with AI interventions, future developers should include tracking to reinforce behavior change self-monitoring and be mindful of repetitive conversations, lengthy setup, and pathways that limit self-directed navigation. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This study focuses on the employment of persuasive technology with artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance student’s emotions and engagement in educational environments. By integrating persuasive elements such as praise, personalization, reminders, and emojis into AI-driven feedback, we aim to bridge the gap in understanding their effects on students’ emotions and engagement levels. Anchored in the control and value theory of achievement emotions, our mixed-methods research will assess these impacts using the Achievement Emotions Questionnaire-Short (AEQ-S) and engagement data from the RiPPLE platform. We hypothesize that such AI feedback strategies will significantly improve students’ emotional experiences and engagement with learning tasks. This inquiry contributes to educational technology by offering insights into designing emotionally intelligent AI feedback systems, potentially enriching the learning experience for university students. Expected outcomes include practical guidance for leveraging AI in creating more engaging and supportive educational settings. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - In 1950, Alan Turing proposed his iconic imitation game, calling it a ‘test’, an ‘experiment’, and the ‘the only really satisfactory support’ for his view that machines can think. Following Turing’s rhetoric, the ‘Turing test’ has been widely received as a kind of crucial experiment to determine machine intelligence. In later sources, however, Turing showed a milder attitude towards what he called his ‘imitation tests’. In 1948, Turing referred to the persuasive power of ‘the actual production of machines’ rather than that of a controlled experiment. Observing this, I propose to distinguish the logical structure from the rhetoric of Turing’s argument. I argue that Turing’s proposal of a crucial experiment may have been a concession to meet the standards of his interlocutors more than his own, while his construction of machine intelligence rather reveals a method of successive idealizations and exploratory experiments. I will draw a parallel with Galileo’s construction of idealized fall in a void and the historiographical controversies over the role of experiment in Galilean science. I suggest that Turing, like Galileo, relied on certain kinds of experiment, but also on rhetoric and propaganda to inspire further research that could lead to convincing scientific and technological progress. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) models can issue smart, context-sensitive recommendations to help patients self-manage their illnesses, including medication regimens, dietary habits, physical activity, and avoiding flare-ups. Instead of merely positing an “edict,” the AI model can also explain why the recommendation was issued: why one should stay indoors (e.g., increased risk of flare-ups), why further calorie intake should be avoided (e.g., met the daily limit), or why the care provider should be contacted (e.g., prescription change). The goal of these explanations is to achieve understanding and persuasion effects, which, in turn, targets education and long-term behavior change. Symbolic AI models facilitate explanations as they are able to offer logical proofs of inferences (or recommendations) from which explanations can be generated. We implemented a modular framework called XAIN (eXplanations for AI in Notation3) to explain symbolic reasoning inferences in a trace-based, contrastive, and counterfactual way. We applied this framework to explain recommendations for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) patients to avoid flare-ups. For evaluation, we propose a questionnaire that captures understanding, persuasion, education, and behavior change, together with traditional XAI metrics including fidelity (soundness, completeness) and interpretability (parsimony, clarity). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Advanced artificial intelligence (AI)-driven futuristic support technologies have transformed a number of industries and changed how people engage with technology. OpenAI’s ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art artificial intelligence model for language processing, is one such innovative creation. The Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) architecture serves as the foundation for ChatGPT. Online, ChatGPT has been growing rapidly. Through the use of commands, people can have conversations with the AI through this chatbot, which is based on OpenAI’s language model. ChatGPT has limitations even if it’s great and yields amazing outcomes when creating stories, poems, songs, essays, and other types of writing. The bot is available for users to ask inquiries, and it will respond with relevant and persuasive topics and answers. These days, ChatGPT is at the top of many academic agendas. In response to the tools, administrators form task forces and call institution-wide meetings; the general consensus is to embrace this technology. This study examines ChatGPT’s prospects, difficulties, most recent developments, and future directions as well as its effects in a variety of industries, including customer service, healthcare, education, and more. We explore ChatGPT’s potential, assessing the state of the field and speculating on how it can affect society. We also consider any potential drawbacks, including issues with data privacy, trouble understanding complex concepts, potentially misleading information, and accessibility issues. Lastly, we outline possible applications for ChatGPT in educational institutions and future research directions, emphasizing its usefulness as a support for instruction, a tool for teachers’ professional development, and a way to boost administrative efficiency. Our examination shows that ChatGPT has a lot of potential to change the advanced education area, despite a few shortcomings that still need to be handled. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - In today's era of digital world and evolving cyber threats, this research paper presents a unified exploration of innovative techniques harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and blockchain to combat deepfake attacks and identity theft. These intertwined challenges demand holistic solutions that transcend traditional boundaries. As the digital landscape is increasingly infiltrated by deepfake technology, concerns surrounding the authenticity of digital content are reaching a critical juncture. Deepfake attacks, capable of generating persuasive yet false imagery and videos, pose a grave societal threat. They undermine trust in media, perpetuate misinformation, and raise the specter of identity theft. Image processing techniques for deepfake detection aim to distinguish real from manipulated content by leveraging advances in AI. Meanwhile, the application of AI and machine learning in deepfake detection has yielded promising results, enhancing our capacity to discern authentic media from forgeries. The research converges on a proactive approach, introducing a pioneering framework that integrates AI and blockchain technology. This paper proposes an Artificial Intelligence-based protection framework, leveraging unsupervised pre-training techniques and Dense Neural Networks (DNN), to combat identity impersonation attacks, particularly the Clone ID attack directed at the Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The research investigates the potential of blockchain, including Smart Contracts to combat the deepfake problem by verifying digital media's history and provenance. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Many important behavior changes are frictionful; they require individuals to expend effort over a long period with little immediate gratification. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent can provide personalized interventions to help individuals stick to their goals. In these settings, the AI agent must personalize rapidly (before the individual disengages) and interpretably, to help us understand the behavioral interventions. In this paper, we introduce Behavior Model Reinforcement Learning (BMRL), a framework in which an AI agent intervenes on the parameters of a Markov Decision Process (MDP) belonging to a boundedly rational human agent. Our formulation of the human decision-maker as a planning agent allows us to attribute undesirable human policies (ones that do not lead to the goal) to their maladapted MDP parameters, such as an extremely low discount factor. Furthermore, we propose a class of tractable human models that captures fundamental behaviors in frictionful tasks. Introducing a notion of MDP equivalence specific to BMRL, we theoretically and empirically show that AI planning with our human models can lead to helpful policies on a wide range of more complex, ground-truth humans. © 2024 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.

AB  - CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing Test to Tell Computers and Humans Apart) has long been employed to combat automated bots. It accomplishes this by utilizing distortion techniques and cognitive characteristics. When it comes to countering security attacks, cognitive CAPTCHA methods have proven to be more effective than other approaches. The advancement of eye-tracking technology has greatly improved human-computer interaction (HCI), enabling users to engage with computers without physical contact. This technology is widely used for studying attention, cognitive processes, and performance. In this specific research, we conducted eye-tracking experiments on participants to investigate how their visual behavior changes as the complexity of cognitive CAPTCHAs varies. By analyzing the distribution of eye gaze on each level of CAPTCHA, we can assess users' visual behavior based on eye movement performance and process metrics. The data collected is then employed in Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to categorize and examine the relative importance of these factors in predicting performance. This study highlights the potential to enhance any cognitive CAPTCHA model by gaining insights into the underlying cognitive processes.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Risky health behaviors place an enormous toll on public health systems. While relapse prevention support is integrated with most behavior modification programs, the results are suboptimal. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) applications provide us with unique opportunities to develop just-in-time adaptive behavior change solutions. Methods: In this study, we present an innovative framework, grounded in behavioral theory, and enhanced with social media sequencing and communications scenario builder to architect a conversational agent (CA) specialized in the prevention of relapses in the context of tobacco cessation. We modeled peer interaction data (n = 1000) using the taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) and speech act (SA) theory to uncover the socio-behavioral and linguistic context embedded within the online social discourse. Further, we uncovered the sequential patterns of BCTs and SAs from social conversations (n = 339,067). We utilized grounded theory-based techniques for extracting the scenarios that best describe individuals’ needs and mapped them into the architecture of the virtual CA. Results: The frequently occurring sequential patterns for BCTs were comparison of behavior and feedback and monitoring; for SAs were directive and assertion. Five cravings-related scenarios describing users’ needs as they deal with nicotine cravings were identified along with the kinds of behavior change constructs that are being elicited within those scenarios. Conclusions: AI-led virtual CAs focusing on behavior change need to employ data-driven and theory-linked approaches to address issues related to engagement, sustainability, and acceptance. The sequential patterns of theory and intent manifestations need to be considered when developing effective behavior change CAs. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - As is common knowledge, there is a long history of harassment of women all throughout the world, beginning with stalking and continuing to more serious types of abuse such as acid attacks, rape, obscenity, pornography, and other forms of abuse. In light of these worries, it has been proposed that the application of machine learning on tweets be utilized in order to do an analysis of the safety of women in urban areas of India. The Sentimental Analysis is employed as the primary idea, and it is carried out by machine learning using input from tweets. This is done to ensure that safety is taken into consideration. Increasing people's awareness can be accomplished by the use of sentiment analysis to tweets. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram, which are well-known for their capacity to distribute information on a worldwide scale, provide women with the opportunity to communicate their feelings to the rest of the world. Because Twitter enables users to effortlessly connect with one another through text, audio, and video, we have listed it as a resource that is of great value. This enables our study to be more persuasive than the opinions of those who are in our immediate vicinity. In this study, a novel model that is referred to as the Artificial Intelligence based Safety Prediction Strategy (AISPS) is presented in order to provide a clear evaluation of the effectiveness of the system that has been recommended. The standard method known as Support Vector Machine (SVM) is utilized in order to do cross-validation on it. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can act as persuaders when implemented in workplace tools and infrastructure. How users process and react to interacting with features of such AI technologies in the workplace remains ill-understood. Literature in human-AI interaction suggests that cues in the user interface can dictate how users process information communicated by an AI and how receptive they are to being persuaded to change or reinforce their behaviors. Literature from human-AI interaction and an existing systematic framework of the study and design of persuasive technology from human-computer interaction can be applied to examining how users interact with persuasive AI in workplace tools and infrastructure. This paper aims to illustrate the application of such a systematic framework for persuasive technology to the study of persuasive AI technologies in the workplace context. Adapted from the persuasive technology framework, an illustrative vignette of a widely used workplace AI-powered tool is offered to further demonstrate features and principles of systems that include a persuasive AI component. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is being utilized in the construction industry to address optimization challenges and to promote the industrial sector’s development and commercialization. The Adaptive Selection Slime Mold Algorithm (ASSMA) was developed in recent years to tackle the problem of optimizing the three aspects of time, cost, and quality in construction projects by combining the slime mold algorithm (SMA) with Tournament Selection (TS). With ASSMA’s help, the transition from random selection to selecting the greatest candidate to decide the best outcome will be hastened. Furthermore, to improve its superiority and efficiency, the ASSMA model will be compared to other common algorithms such as Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), Oppositionbased Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (OMODE), Multi-Objective Differential Evolution (MODE), and non-dominant sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGAII). According to the overall findings, the ASSMA model displays diversity and gives a powerful and persuasive optimum solution enabling readers to see the future potential of the proposed approach. © The Author(s).

AB  - We begin with the premise that empathy adds value as a strategic marketing skill. Getting into the heads and hearts of consumers enables tailored offerings and tactics that meet the unique, richly contextualized needs of a given target audience segment. The advent of marketing automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to make human-centered skills even more critical to develop, as AI’s capabilities stop short of emotional connection and interpretation. As a result, we ask how empathy can be cultivated and applied, and if so, will empathy toward a given market segment result in attitude or behavior change? This paper details a three-stage project that gives students the opportunity to practice using empathy toward a specific market segment–transgender consumers. Students leverage empathy to ultimately develop concrete innovations across a broad range of marketing tactics. We also discuss the impact of the project on students. Results indicate that students completing the project embraced empathy as a strategic skill, and in the process, many also expressed intended support behaviors for the transgender community, although attitudes toward the transgender community did not change. © 2023 Society for Marketing Advances.

AB  - Educational materials that utilize generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT) have been developed, thus, allowing students to learn through conversations with robots or agents. However, if these artificial entities provide incorrect information (hallucinating), it could lead to confusion among students. To investigate whether students can detect lies from these artificial entities, we conducted an experiment using the social robot Furhat and we make it engage in various types of deceptive interactions. Twenty-two Japanese middle school students participated in ten teaching sessions with Furhat using a human and an anime facial appearances while employing different types of deception: Lying, Paltering, Pandering, and Bullshit. The results revealed that the majority of students were deceived by those lies. Additionally, the robot's facial appearance (i.e., social agency) affected both the learning effectiveness and the likelihood of being deceived. We conclude that an anime robot face is recommended to be used as it excelled in learning effectiveness as it attracts students attention. An anime face also provided protection against deceptive techniques due to its low social agency which leads to ineffectiveness in persuasion and deception. This study underscores the importance of preparing AI-based educational tools and scripts carefully to prevent the dissemination of false information produced through generative AI hallucinations to students.

AB  - Increasing shares of intermittent renewable energy sources and targets for greenhouse gas emissions reduction challenge the reliable and economic operation of energy systems. An effective energy transition requires urgent actions to empower consumers, enable demand-side flexibility, and promote new roles such as prosumers, aggregators, and energy communities. Currently, citizens’ engagement in new energy services and products is hindered by energy market regulation and lack of information, two-way communication, and trust with utilities. We envision learning communities as vital in enabling citizens to participate in socio-technical imaginaries of user-centered, sustainable, and affordable energy systems. We will develop and demonstrate integrated tools for citizens’ long-term engagement and empowerment in energy applications through research on persuasive and inclusive serious game design, coupled with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, energy models, and smart meter data input, to provide informed and reliable feedback to citizens about optimal home energy management. While we are eager to complete the development and proceed with experimentation, the steps taken so far and the lessons learned during this preparatory stage are useful to document and share with practitioners and the academic community. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Internet Service Providers (ISPs) exponentially incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms and Machine Learning techniques to achieve commercial objectives of extensive data harvesting and manipulation to drive customer traffic, decrease costs, and exploit the virtual public sphere through innovative Advertisement Technology (Ad-Tech). Increasing incorporation of Generative AI to aggregate and classify collected data to generate persuasive content tailored to the behavioral patterns of users questions their information security and informational self-determinism. Significant risks arise with inappropriate information processing and analysis of big data, including personal and special data protected by influential data protection and privacy regulation worldwide. This paper bridges the inter-disciplinary gap between developers of AI applications and their socio-legal impact on democratic societies. Accordingly, the work asks how AI Behavioural Marketing poses inadequately addressed data and privacy protection risks, followed by an approach to mitigate them. The approach is developed through doctrinal research of regulatory frameworks and court decisions to establish the current legislative landscape for AI-driven Ad-Tech. The work exposes the pertinent risks triggered by algorithms by analyzing the discourse of academics, developers, and social groups. It argues that understanding the risks associated with Information Processing and Invasion is seminal to developing appropriate industry solutions through a cumulative layered approach. This work proves timely to address these contentious issues using conventional and non-conventional approaches and aspires to promote a pragmatic collaboration between developers and policymakers to address the risks throughout the AI Value Chain to safeguard individuals’ data protection and privacy rights. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Adopting healthy behavior is vital for preventing chronic diseases. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions utilizing virtual coaches (i.e., artificial intelligence conversational agents) can offer scalable and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, targeting multiple unhealthy behaviors, like low physical activity and smoking, simultaneously seems beneficial. We developed Perfect Fit, an mHealth intervention with a virtual coach providing personalized feedback to simultaneously promote smoking cessation and physical activity. Through innovative methods (e.g., sensor technology) and iterative development involving end-users, we strive to overcome challenges encountered by mHealth interventions, such as shortage of evidence-based interventions and insufficient personalization. This paper outlines the content of Perfect Fit and the protocol for evaluating its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness, the role of participant characteristics, and the study's feasibility. Methods: A single-arm, mixed-method, real-world evaluation study will be conducted in the Netherlands. We aim to recruit 100 adult daily smokers intending to quit within 6 weeks. The personalized intervention will last approximately 16 weeks. Primary outcomes include Perfect Fit's feasibility and acceptability. Secondary outcomes are preliminary effectiveness and study feasibility, and we will measure participant characteristics. Quantitative data will be collected through questionnaires administered at baseline, post-intervention and 2, 6, and 12 months post-intervention. Qualitative data will be gathered via semi-structured interviews post-intervention. Data analysis will involve descriptive analyses, generalized linear mixed models (quantitative) and the Framework Approach (qualitative), integrating quantitative and qualitative data during interpretation. Conclusions: This study will provide novel insight into the potential of interventions like Perfect Fit, as a multiple health behavior change strategy. Findings will inform further intervention development and help identify methods to foster feasibility and acceptability. Successful mHealth interventions with virtual coaches will prevent chronic diseases and promote public health. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps offer unique opportunities to support self-care and behavior change, but poor user engagement limits their effectiveness. This is particularly true for fully automated mHealth apps without any human support. Human support in mHealth apps is associated with better engagement but at the cost of reduced scalability. Objective: This work aimed to (1) describe the theory-informed development of a fully automated relaxation and mindfulness app to reduce distress in people with cancer (CanRelax app 2.0), (2) describe engagement with the app on multiple levels within a fully automated randomized controlled trial over 10 weeks, and (3) examine whether engagement was related to user characteristics. Methods: The CanRelax app 2.0 was developed in iterative processes involving input from people with cancer and relevant experts. The app includes evidence-based relaxation exercises, personalized weekly coaching sessions with a rule-based conversational agent, 39 self-enactable behavior change techniques, a self-monitoring dashboard with gamification elements, highly tailored reminder notifications, an educational video clip, and personalized in-app letters. For the larger study, German-speaking adults diagnosed with cancer within the last 5 years were recruited via the web in Switzerland, Austria, and Germany. Engagement was analyzed in a sample of 100 study participants with multiple measures on a micro level (completed coaching sessions, relaxation exercises practiced with the app, and feedback on the app) and a macro level (relaxation exercises practiced without the app and self-efficacy toward self-set weekly relaxation goals). Results: In week 10, a total of 62% (62/100) of the participants were actively using the CanRelax app 2.0. No associations were identified between engagement and level of distress at baseline, sex assigned at birth, educational attainment, or age. At the micro level, 71.88% (3520/4897) of all relaxation exercises and 714 coaching sessions were completed in the app, and all participants who provided feedback (52/100, 52%) expressed positive app experiences. At the macro level, 28.12% (1377/4897) of relaxation exercises were completed without the app, and participants' self-efficacy remained stable at a high level. At the same time, participants raised their weekly relaxation goals, which indicates a potential relative increase in self-efficacy. Conclusions: The CanRelax app 2.0 achieved promising engagement even though it provided no human support. Fully automated social components might have compensated for the lack of human involvement and should be investigated further. More than one-quarter (1377/4897, 28.12%) of all relaxation exercises were practiced without the app, highlighting the importance of assessing engagement on multiple levels. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Many important areas of behavior change, such as wellness or education, are frictionful; they require individuals to expend effort over a long period of time with little immediate gratification. Because of this, humans often act sub-optimally with respect to their stated long-term goal. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI) agent can provide personalized behavioral interventions to correct human policies. The AI must personalize rapidly (before the individual has a chance to disengage) and interpretably, to aid our scientific understanding of the behavioral interventions. This work focuses on crafting small, interpretable models of the human that capture the mechanism behind the human agent's sub-optimal policies. These human models provide the AI with enough inductive bias to quickly learn intervention policies for each individual it encounters. © 2024 International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems.

AB  - Introduction: Despite the effectiveness of exercise-based interventions on symptom management and disease progression, many people with Parkinson’s Disease (PwPD) do not exercise regularly. In line with the ubiquitous use of digital health technology, the MoveONParkinson digital solution was developed, comprising a Web Platform and a Mobile App with a Conversational Agent (CA). The interface features were designed based on the principles of Social Cognitive Theory with the goal of fostering behavior change in PwPD for sustained exercise participation and improved disease management. Methods: Using a mixed methods approach, this study aimed to collect feedback, assess the acceptability of the Mobile App and the Web Platform, and evaluate the usability of the latter. Quantitative data, which included questionnaire responses and the System Usability Scale (SUS) scores, were analyzed using descriptive statistics, heatmaps, and correlation matrices. Qualitative data, comprising semi-structured and thinking-aloud interview transcripts, were subjected to an inductive thematic analysis. A total of 28 participants were involved in the study, comprising 20 physiotherapists (average age: 34.50 ± 10.4), and eight PwPD (average age: 65.75 ± 8.63; mean Hoehn & Yahr: 2.0 (± 0.76)). Results: Three main themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the interviews, namely: Self-management (Theme 1), User Engagement (Theme 2), and Recommendations (Theme 3). The assessment of the Mobile App and the CA (mean score: 4.42/5.0 ± 0.79) suggests that PwPD were able to navigate this interface without notable difficulties. The mean SUS score of 79.50 (± 12.40%) with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 73.70 to 85.30, reveal good usability. Discussion: These findings indicate a high level of acceptability of the MoveONParkinson digital solution, serving as a foundation for assessing its impact on exercise engagement and, subsequently, its influence on symptom management and quality of life of PwPD.

AB  - Background: Primary headaches, including migraine and tension-type headaches, are widespread and have a social, physical, mental, and economic impact. Among the key components of treatment are behavior interventions such as lifestyle modification. Scalable conversational agents (CAs) have the potential to deliver behavior interventions at a low threshold. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of behavioral interventions delivered by CAs for the treatment of headaches. Objective: This study has 2 aims. The first aim was to develop and test a smartphone-based coaching intervention (BalanceUP) for people experiencing frequent headaches, delivered by a CA and designed to improve mental well-being using various behavior change techniques. The second aim was to evaluate the effectiveness of BalanceUP by comparing the intervention and waitlist control groups and assess the engagement and acceptance of participants using BalanceUP. Methods: In an unblinded randomized controlled trial, adults with frequent headaches were recruited on the web and in collaboration with experts and allocated to either a CA intervention (BalanceUP) or a control condition. The effects of the treatment on changes in the primary outcome of the study, that is, mental well-being (as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety and Depression Scale), and secondary outcomes (eg, psychosomatic symptoms, stress, headache-related self-efficacy, intention to change behavior, presenteeism and absenteeism, and pain coping) were analyzed using linear mixed models and Cohen d. Primary and secondary outcomes were self-assessed before and after the intervention, and acceptance was assessed after the intervention. Engagement was measured during the intervention using self-reports and usage data. Results: A total of 198 participants (mean age 38.7, SD 12.14 y; n=172, 86.9% women) participated in the study (intervention group: n=110; waitlist control group: n=88). After the intervention, the intention-to-treat analysis revealed evidence for improved well-being (treatment: β estimate=-3.28, 95% CI -5.07 to -1.48) with moderate between-group effects (Cohen d=-0.66, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.33) in favor of the intervention group. We also found evidence of reduced somatic symptoms, perceived stress, and absenteeism and presenteeism, as well as improved headache management self-efficacy, application of behavior change techniques, and pain coping skills, with effects ranging from medium to large (Cohen d=0.43-1.05). Overall, 64.8% (118/182) of the participants used coaching as intended by engaging throughout the coaching and completing the outro. Conclusions: BalanceUP was well accepted, and the results suggest that coaching delivered by a CA can be effective in reducing the burden of people who experience headaches by improving their well-being.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to enhance physical activity (PA) interventions. However, human factors (HFs) play a pivotal role in the successful integration of AI into mobile health (mHealth) solutions for promoting PA. Understanding and optimizing the interaction between individuals and AI-driven mHealth apps is essential for achieving the desired outcomes. Objective: This study aims to review and describe the current evidence on the HFs in AI-driven digital solutions for increasing PA. Methods: We conducted a scoping review by searching for publications containing terms related to PA, HFs, and AI in the titles and abstracts across 3 databases—PubMed, Embase, and IEEE Xplore—and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they were primary studies describing an AI-based solution aimed at increasing PA, and results from testing the solution were reported. Studies that did not meet these criteria were excluded. Additionally, we searched the references in the included articles for relevant research. The following data were extracted from included studies and incorporated into a qualitative synthesis: bibliographic information, study characteristics, population, intervention, comparison, outcomes, and AI-related information. The certainty of the evidence in the included studies was evaluated using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation). Results: A total of 15 studies published between 2015 and 2023 involving 899 participants aged approximately between 19 and 84 years, 60.7% (546/899) of whom were female participants, were included in this review. The interventions lasted between 2 and 26 weeks in the included studies. Recommender systems were the most commonly used AI technology in digital solutions for PA (10/15 studies), followed by conversational agents (4/15 studies). User acceptability and satisfaction were the HFs most frequently evaluated (5/15 studies each), followed by usability (4/15 studies). Regarding automated data collection for personalization and recommendation, most systems involved fitness trackers (5/15 studies). The certainty of the evidence analysis indicates moderate certainty of the effectiveness of AI-driven digital technologies in increasing PA (eg, number of steps, distance walked, or time spent on PA). Furthermore, AI-driven technology, particularly recommender systems, seems to positively influence changes in PA behavior, although with very low certainty evidence. Conclusions: Current research highlights the potential of AI-driven technologies to enhance PA, though the evidence remains limited. Longer-term studies are necessary to assess the sustained impact of AI-driven technologies on behavior change and habit formation. While AI-driven digital solutions for PA hold significant promise, further exploration into optimizing AI’s impact on PA and effectively integrating AI and HFs is crucial for broader benefits. Thus, the implications for innovation management involve conducting long-term studies, prioritizing diversity, ensuring research quality, focusing on user experience, and understanding the evolving role of AI in PA promotion. ©Elia Gabarron, Dillys Larbi, Octavio Rivera-Romero, Kerstin Denecke.

AB  - Background: Digital health interventions show promise for weight management. However, few text-based behavior change interventions have been designed to support patients receiving intragastric balloons, and none have simultaneously evaluated weight loss, psychological well-being, and behavior change despite the crucial interplay of these factors in weight management. Objective: This study aims to assess whether a health coach–led, asynchronous, text-based digital behavior change coaching intervention (DBCCI) delivered to participants receiving an intragastric balloon and its aftercare program was feasible and acceptable to participants and supported improved outcomes, including weight loss, psychological well-being, and lifestyle behavior change conducive to weight loss maintenance. Methods: This 12-month, single-arm prospective study enrolled adults aged 21 to 65 years with BMI ≥27 kg/m2 receiving a procedureless intragastric balloon (PIGB) at 5 bariatric clinics in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Participants received the DBCCI and the clinic-led PIGB aftercare program (remotely delivered) for 6 months after PIGB placement and then no intervention for an additional 6 months. The DBCCI was an evidence-based, personalized intervention wherein health coaches supported participants via exchanged asynchronous in-app text-based messages. Over the 12-month study, we assessed percentage of total body weight loss and psychological well-being via self-administered validated questionnaires (Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale, Impact of Weight on Quality of Life–Lite–Clinical Trials Version, Loss of Control Over Eating Scale–Brief, Weight Efficacy Lifestyle Questionnaire–Short Form, and Barriers to Being Active Quiz). Participant engagement with and acceptability of the intervention were assessed via self-reported surveys. Results: Overall, 107 participants (n=96, 89.7% female; mean baseline BMI 35.4, SD 5.4 kg/m2) were included in the analysis. Mean total body weight loss was 13.5% (SEM 2.3%) at the end of the DBCCI and 11.22% (SEM 2.3%) at the 12-month follow-up (P<.001). Improvements were observed for all psychological well-being measures throughout the 12 months except for the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (improvement at month 1) and Barriers to Being Active Quiz (improvements at months 3 and 6). Surveys showed high levels of engagement with and acceptability of the DBCCI. Conclusions: This study provides evidence that the health coach–led, asynchronous, text-based DBCCI was engaging and acceptable to participants with overweight and obesity. The DBCCI, delivered alongside the PIGB and its aftercare program, supported improved weight loss outcomes and psychological well-being versus baseline and was associated with lifestyle behavior changes known to help achieve and maintain long-term weight loss and improved health outcomes. Follow-up findings suggest a potential need for longer-term, more intense coaching to focus on weight loss maintenance and support ongoing self-coaching. This could be achieved by leveraging generative artificial intelligence to provide ongoing automated behavior change coaching support to augment human-led care. ©Paul M Sacher, Emily Fulton, Victoria Rogers, Julia Wilson, Marco Gramatica, Jennifer E Dent, Edo O Aarts, David Eccleston, Jan Willem Greve, Inge Palm-Meinders, Ram Chuttani.

AB  - Background: In today’s digital age, web-based apps have become integral to daily life, driving transformative shifts in human behavior. “AgileNudge+” (Indiana University Center for Health Innovation and Implementation Science) is a web-based solution to simplify the process of positive behavior change using nudging as an intervention. By integrating knowledge from behavioral economics with technology, AgileNudge+ organizes multiple steps, simplifies complex tasks, minimizes errors by enhancing user engagement, and provides resources for creating and testing nudge interventions. Objective: This paper aimed to outline the design process, methodologies, and usefulness of “AgileNudge+” for the development of evidence-based nudges. It used a mixed methods approach to evaluate the software’s interface usability and usefulness for creating and testing nudge interventions. Methods: AgileNudge+ was developed through iterative processes integrating principles from behavioral economics and user-centered design. The content of AgileNudge+ operationalizes an Agile science–based process to efficiently design, embed, and disseminate evidence-based nudges that encourage positive behavior change without limiting choice. Using a mixed methods approach, we tested AgileNudge+ software’s ability to organize and simplify the nudge intervention process, allowing a diverse range of scholars with limited knowledge of Agile science to use nudges. Usability testing assessed the tool’s usefulness and interface with a sample of 18 health care professionals, each asked to interact with the software and create a nudge intervention to solve a problem within their professional project’s sphere. Results: The study was funded in August 2022, with data collection occurring from June 2023 to July 2024. As of July 2024, we have enrolled 18 participants. Quantitative results found a mean usefulness rating of AgileNudge+ of 3.83 (95% CI 3.00-4.66). Qualitative results highlighted ways to modify the language used in AgileNudge+ to be more comprehensible to a diverse user base and promoted modifications to the software that facilitate real-time assistance and prioritize time efficiency in user interactions. Feedback further supported the positive impact of gamification on participant motivation when using the software. Conclusions: AgileNudge+ is an effective assistive tool for simplifying the positive behavior change process using nudge interventions, with tailored content and interactions to meet users’ needs and demands. Building onto the current design, future iterations of AgileNudge+ will use artificial intelligence to process large volumes of data while reducing the time and mental energy required to scan for existing cognitive biases and nudge prototypes. The software is also being upgraded to build on current gamification efforts, encouraging more sustained motivation by increasing the temporal resolution of the digital interface. These modifications stay true to the agility and user-centered aspects of AgileNudge+, emphasizing the novelty of the constantly evolving software design process. ©Fereshtehossadat Shojaei, Fatemehalsadat Shojaei, Archita P Desai, Emily Long, Jade Mehta, Nicole R Fowler, Richard J Holden, Eric S Orman, Malaz Boustani.

AB  - Explainable AI (XAI) has the potential to enhance decision-making in human-AI collaborations, yet existing research indicates that explanations can also lead to undue reliance on AI recommendations, a dilemma often referred to as the ‘white box paradox.’ This paradox illustrates how persuasive explanations for incorrect advice might foster inappropriate trust in AI systems. Our study extends beyond the traditional scope of the white box paradox by proposing a framework for examining explanation inadequacy. We specifically investigate how accurate AI advice, when paired with misleading explanations, affects decision-making in logic puzzle tasks. Our findings introduce the concept of the ‘XAI halo effect,’ where participants were influenced by the misleading explanations to the extent that they did not verify the correctness of the advice, despite its accuracy. This effect reveals a nuanced challenge in XAI, where even correct advice can lead to misjudgment if the accompanying explanations are not coherent and contextually relevant. The study highlights the critical need for explanations to be both accurate and relevant, especially in contexts where decision accuracy is paramount. This calls into question the use of explanations in situations where their potential to mislead outweighs their transparency or educational value. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are revolutionizing various scientific and clinical disciplines including pharmacogenomics (PGx) by enabling the analysis of complex datasets and the development of predictive models. The integration of AI and ML with PGx has the potential to provide more precise, data-driven insights into new drug targets, drug efficacy, drug selection, and risk of adverse events. While significant effort to develop and validate these tools remain, ongoing advancements in AI technologies, coupled with improvements in data quality and depth is anticipated to drive the transition of these tools into clinical practice and delivery of individualized treatments and improved patient outcomes. The successful development and integration of AI-assisted PGx tools will require careful consideration of ethical, legal, and social issues (ELSI) in research and clinical practice. This paper explores the intersection of PGx with AI, highlighting current research and potential clinical applications, and ELSI including privacy, oversight, patient and provider knowledge and acceptance, and the impact on patient-provider relationship and new roles. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Smoking cessation services are an established part of the UK health system, funded by national and local governments. Services are commissioned by Local Authorities (Local Government) according to local needs and are provided by organizations that are paid to deliver services, usually based on achieving a number of 4-week quits per year. Everyone Health is one such commissioned service, delivering Stop Smoking Services across England in 6 Local Authorities, and delivering thousands of 4-week quits per year. To maximize quit rates, Everyone Health has worked with Emeritus Professor Robert West of UCL and British Websites to develop an Artificial Intelligence-driven app to provide treats and advice to those being supported through our services to make and maintain a quit attempt. This oral presentation will describe the process of developing and initial piloting of the app and the plans for evaluation following the rollout. © (2024), (European Publishing).

AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are a promising solution to support people in improving physical activity (PA) behaviors. However, there is a lack of CAs targeted at adolescents that aim to provide support to overcome barriers to PA. This study reports the results of the co-design, development, and evaluation of a prototype CA called “Phyllis” to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA with the aim of improving PA behaviors. The study presents one of the first theory-driven CAs that use existing research, a theoretical framework, and a behavior change model. Objective: The aim of the study is to use a mixed methods approach to investigate the potential of a CA to support adolescents in overcoming barriers to PA and enhance their confidence and motivation to engage in PA. Methods: The methodology involved co-designing with 8 adolescents to create a relational and persuasive CA with a suitable persona and dialogue. The CA was evaluated to determine its acceptability, usability, and effectiveness, with 46 adolescents participating in the study via a web-based survey. Results: The co-design participants were students aged 11 to 13 years, with a sex distribution of 56% (5/9) female and 44% (4/9) male, representing diverse ethnic backgrounds. Participants reported 37 specific barriers to PA, and the most common barriers included a “lack of confidence,” “fear of failure,” and a “lack of motivation.” The CA’s persona, named “Phyllis,” was co-designed with input from the students, reflecting their preferences for a friendly, understanding, and intelligent personality. Users engaged in 61 conversations with Phyllis and reported a positive user experience, and 73% of them expressed a definite intention to use the fully functional CA in the future, with a net promoter score indicating a high likelihood of recommendation. Phyllis also performed well, being able to recognize a range of different barriers to PA. The CA’s persuasive capacity was evaluated in modules focusing on confidence and motivation, with a significant increase in students’ agreement in feeling confident and motivated to engage in PA after interacting with Phyllis. Adolescents also expect to have a personalized experience and be able to personalize all aspects of the CA. Conclusions: The results showed high acceptability and a positive user experience, indicating the CA’s potential. Promising outcomes were observed, with increasing confidence and motivation for PA. Further research and development are needed to create further interventions to address other barriers to PA and assess long-term behavior change. Addressing concerns regarding bias and privacy is crucial for achieving acceptability in the future. The CA’s potential extends to health care systems and multimodal support, providing valuable insights for designing digital health interventions including tackling global inactivity issues among adolescents. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - The prominence and profitability of influencer marketing have facilitated a proliferation of virtual influencers—fictitious digital personalities created and managed using artificial intelligence. Virtual influencers may offer advertisers greater creative control and yield greater engagement than human influencers. Hence, we investigated these claims by comparing the persuasion strategies and outcomes between human and virtual influencers. We retrieved 99,680 English-language Instagram posts uploaded by 424 human and virtual influencers within the beauty, fashion, and lifestyle domains from 2020 to 2022. Dictionary-based sentiment analysis (replicated across the AFINN and Bing lexicons) indicated that Instagram posts from both types of influencers predominantly conveyed positive sentiment. Latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling revealed that both types of influencers asserted opinion leadership differently: Human influencers engaged in active self-promotion, while virtual influencers emphasized their identity. A natural experiment found that human influencers elicited greater engagement than virtual influencers. Influencer tier also significantly interacted with Instagram verification to affect engagement. Theoretical contributions, managerial implications, and directions for future research are discussed. © 2024 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Supply Chain Management is a quintessential task of every firm as it is the core of the business. A business is driven entirely by customer behaviour, change in seasonal demand and how the customer expand or shrunk their purchasing power. The stock available in the inventory should also be managed based on the changing demand, if under stocked or overstocked leads to huge losses to the business and they will also lose their market share. This work focuses on the ongoing problem in the supply chain domain, which is the Bull Whip Effect, wherein a slight change in the customer demand has a significant impact in the inventory leading to stocking more than required. Many methodologies have been incorporated to reduce the effect of Bull whip. The advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence has rendered effective to solve various real time problems. The machine learning algorithms can be fine-tuned to predict the seasonal demand in the market in prior based on the customer behaviour. The prediction results obtained using CatBoost machine learning algorithm has proven effective as it predicts the sales with better accuracy by combining the boosting technique on a decision tree. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This study examined the effect of chatbots’ emotional expression on climate-change-mitigation behaviour intention and the individual and serial mediating roles of social presence and guilt in the main effect. This study further tested the moderating role of custom addressing in direct and indirect relationships between the aforementioned variables. To that end, 577 American adults were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. After eliminating incomplete responses, the remaining 549 participants were assigned to four conditions (factual vs. emotional conditions x control vs. custom addressing conditions), conversed briefly with a chatbot agent, and responded to a questionnaire. The findings showed that chatbots’ emotional expression yielded higher climate-change-mitigation behavioural intention than factual information and that social presence mediated this relationship. The results did not support the mediating role of guilt but supported serial mediation through social presence and guilt. The results further support the moderating role of custom addressing in the indirect relationship through social presence and serially through social presence and guilt. However, the results do not support the moderating role of custom addressing in direct and indirect relationships through guilt. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Generative artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize health technology product development by improving coding quality, efficiency, documentation, quality assessment and review, and troubleshooting. Objective: This paper explores the application of a commercially available generative artificial intelligence tool (ChatGPT) to the development of a digital health behavior change intervention designed to support patient engagement in a commercial digital diabetes prevention program. Methods: We examined the capacity, advantages, and limitations of ChatGPT to support digital product idea conceptualization, intervention content development, and the software engineering process, including software requirement generation, software design, and code production. In total, 11 evaluators, each with at least 10 years of experience in fields of study ranging from medicine and implementation science to computer science, participated in the output review process (ChatGPT vs human-generated output). All had familiarity or prior exposure to the original personalized automatic messaging system intervention. The evaluators rated the ChatGPT-produced outputs in terms of understandability, usability, novelty, relevance, completeness, and efficiency. Results: Most metrics received positive scores. We identified that ChatGPT can (1) support developers to achieve high-quality products faster and (2) facilitate nontechnical communication and system understanding between technical and nontechnical team members around the development goal of rapid and easy-to-build computational solutions for medical technologies. Conclusions: ChatGPT can serve as a usable facilitator for researchers engaging in the software development life cycle, from product conceptualization to feature identification and user story development to code generation. ©Danissa V Rodriguez, Katharine Lawrence, Javier Gonzalez, Beatrix Brandfield-Harvey, Lynn Xu, Sumaiya Tasneem, Defne L Levine, Devin Mann.

AB  - To give product and brand recommendations, marketers make use of conversational agents which increasingly communicate via voice rather than text. Existing research comparing the persuasiveness of text and voice agents showed mixed results. The quality of the speech synthesis employed may strongly influence consumers’ responses. This study investigates to what extent a voice agent with pragmatically aligned prosody is more persuasive (i.e. yields a more positive brand attitude) than an agent with a standard voice or text, and whether perceived human-likeness and perceived personalisation provide an underlying mechanism to explain these differences. In an experiment (n = 212), participants interacted with a conversational agent that recommended a camera. Results showed that a voice agent using prosody aligned to the information state of the user is more persuasive than a text agent. This effect is mediated by perceived human-likeness and perceived personalisation. Hence, aligned prosody can make synthetic speech meet a certain quality threshold to be perceived as more human-like. Theoretically, this study helps to unravel why conversational agents with human-like features are more persuasive. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Mental illnesses represent a significant global health challenge, affecting millions with far-reaching social and economic impacts. Traditional exercise prescriptions for mental health often adopt a one-size-fits-all approach, which overlooks individual variations in mental and physical health. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) offer an opportunity to tailor these interventions more effectively. Objective: This study aims to develop and evaluate a multimodal data-driven AI system for personalized exercise prescriptions, targeting individuals with mental illnesses. By leveraging AI, the study seeks to overcome the limitations of conventional exercise regimens and improve adherence and mental health outcomes. Methods: The study is conducted in two phases. Initially, 1,000 participants will be recruited for AI model training and testing, with 800 forming the training set, augmented by 9,200 simulated samples generated by ChatGPT, and 200 as the testing set. Data annotation will be performed by experienced physicians from the Department of Mental Health at Guangdong Second Provincial General Hospital. Subsequently, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) with 40 participants will be conducted to compare the AI-driven exercise prescriptions against standard care. Assessments will be scheduled at 6, 12, and 18 months to evaluate cognitive, physical, and psychological outcomes. Expected outcomes: The AI-driven system is expected to demonstrate greater effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes compared to standard exercise prescriptions. Personalized exercise regimens, informed by comprehensive data analysis, are anticipated to enhance participant adherence and overall mental well-being. These outcomes could signify a paradigm shift in exercise prescription for mental health, paving the way for more personalized and effective treatment modalities.

AB  - Scientific interest in the processing and effects of narrative information has substantially increased in recent years. The focus of this chapter is on narrative transportation, an experiential state of immersion in which all mental processes are concentrated on the events occurring in the narrative. We describe and integrate interdisciplinary advances in the study of narrative transportation. After an introduction of the concept and related approaches, we outline antecedents in terms of story factors, individual differences, situational variables, and related interactions. In the following sections, we introduce processes and effects that are facilitated by stories and narrative transportation. This includes research on persuasion, misinformation and its correction, self and identity, social cognitive skills, and the fulfillment of belongingness needs. We close with an outlook on the role of technology and artificial intelligence, meaning making, and climate change communication as emerging and future directions. © 2024

AB  - With the increasingly sophisticated improvements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in marketing communications, a gap prevails between heightened levels of excitement around it and high-level application. Consequently, this topic necessitates in-depth investigation to prepare for future changes. This study examines the role of AI in programmatic advertising through a quantitative content analysis of AI-enabled digital programmatic advertisements. Although the idea that sponsorship disclosure, appeals, and sentiments are important in persuasive messages has been documented, this study extends existing literature by examining these concepts within AI-enabled programmatic advertising. Sponsorship-linked marketing and congruence theory guided this study. The results showed that only about half of the ads revealed sponsorship information. Further, the brand-sponsor association was not clearly established in the ads. A sentiment analysis showed the prominence of positive sentiments in the ads. Additionally, the ads mostly used product- and consumer-focused appeals. Theoretical and research contributions and strategic marketing implications are discussed. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As trailblazer in streaming entertainment, Netflix has redefined how people consume media, captivating audiences with its original programming. Despite this, the streaming giant could not translate similar success with its video game offering. This paper is an outcome of a unique experimental study which examines the built-in features of interactive storytelling games and their effect on induced persuasion and exploration among game players. This research involves eighty- eight players playing two popular games from the Netflix library. It tests the effects of artificial intelligence, feature interactivity, device responsiveness and personalization features of the game on induced persuasion and exploration among gamers. Using Bayesian regression and correlation, the results help to deduce that while built-in features can effectively persuade players, they fall short in encouraging deeper exploration within the game’s narrative. It also illustrates the growing significance of artificial intelligence in human computer interaction. The study also highlights the critical role of storytelling for the gaming business and its significance in developing new visual culture. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Poker has often been used as a metaphor for international relations and existential threats such as nuclear weapons. Nate Silver’s On the Edge: The Art of Risking Everything is a lengthy, often meandering but always entertaining exploration of this metaphor and its salience in the twenty-first century, from the world of professional gambling to existential risks such as climate change, nuclear weapons and artificial intelligence. The book has two entangled but independent threads: a discussion on how to think about risk, and a sociocultural conceit that modern elites, especially in the United States, can be meaningfully divided into two tribes competing for power and influence. What separates these groups are not, as Silver contends, cognitive and psychological traits, but in-group jargon and cultural references. Silver’s discussions and insights about how to think about risk do not need this dichotomy to be real or sound; in fact; the conceit offers more distraction than insight. © 2024 The International Institute for Strategic Studies.

AB  - Background: As the age of initiating sexual intercourse has gradually decreased among South Korean adolescents, earlier vaccination of adolescents for human papillomavirus (HPV) is necessary before their exposure to HPV. Health communication includes “cues to action” that lead to preventive health behaviors, and recently, social networking services, which operate with fewer time and space constraints, have been used in various studies as a form of eHealth communication. Objective: This study aims to investigate the feasibility and usability of an eHealth communication intervention for HPV vaccination in middle-school girls aimed at the girls and their mothers. Methods: The eHealth communication intervention for HPV vaccination was developed using a 6-step intervention mapping process: needs assessments, setting program outcomes, selection of a theory-based method and practical strategies, development of the intervention, implementation plan, and testing the validity of the intervention. Results: A review of 10 studies identified effective health communication messages, delivery methods, and theories for HPV vaccination among adolescents. Barriers including low knowledge, perceived threat, and the inconvenience of taking 2 doses of the vaccine were identified through focus groups, suggesting a need for youth-friendly and easy-to-understand information for adolescents delivered via mobile phones. The expected outcomes and the performance objectives are specifically tailored to reflect the vaccination intention. Behavior change techniques were applied using trusted sources and a health belief model. Health messages delivered through a KakaoTalk chatbot improved awareness and self-efficacy. Quality control was ensured with the use of a log system. The experts’ chatbot usability average score was 80.13 (SD 8.15) and the average score of girls was 84.06 (SD 7.61). Conclusions: Future studies need to verify the effectiveness of health communication strategies in promoting HPV vaccination and the effectiveness of scientific intervention using a chatbot as a delivery method for the intervention. ©Youlim Kim, Hyeonkyeong Lee, Jeongok Park, Yong-Chan Kim, Dong Hee Kim, Young-Me Lee.

AB  - Social media is emerged as a powerful communication tool over the past ten years. The Z generation’s green buying habits and purchase intentions are being reshaped by social media, which is helping to advance the development of a sustainable environment. The consumption of non-organic products has raised carbon emissions, so changing consumption patterns and purchase intentions is necessary for a more sustainable future. Moreover, earlier literature has the absence of a comprehensive behavior change model that explains the mechanism through which social media influences sustainable behaviors This study explores that how social media affects patterns of consumption for Z generation of China while considering the role of environmental concerns, subjective norms, eco-branding and eco-labeling on the basis of theory of planned behavior. A questionnaire is used to get information from the 563 Z generation respondents of China. The data is analyzed using Smart-PLS and empirical outcomes show that social media has a statistically significant influence on shaping and affecting green consumption behavior of China’s Z generation because it has the potential to reach a vast audience and spread awareness about environmental issues, leading to increased intention towards a sustainable environment and reduction in carbon emissions. It also provides a platform for individuals to express their opinions and engage in discussions on environmental issues. These developments are promising for the future of environmental sustainability as they indicate a growing interest in preserving the planet among the Z generation of China. It can be recommended as a policy tool that government and other organizations should support the development of informative content on social media platforms, highlighting the importance of environmental sustainability and ecofriendly habits.

AB  - With the continuous development and change exhibited by large language model (LLM) technology, represented by generative pretrained transformers (GPTs), many classic scenarios in various fields have re-emerged with new opportunities. This paper takes ChatGPT as the modeling object, incorporates LLM technology into the typical book resource understanding and recommendation scenario for the first time, and puts it into practice. By building a ChatGPT-like book recommendation system (BookGPT) framework based on ChatGPT, this paper attempts to apply ChatGPT to recommendation modeling for three typical tasks: book rating recommendation, user rating recommendation, and the book summary recommendation; it also explores the feasibility of LLM technology in book recommendation scenarios. At the same time, based on different evaluation schemes for book recommendation tasks and the existing classic recommendation models, this paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of the BookGPT in book recommendation scenarios and analyzes the opportunities and improvement directions for subsequent LLMs in these scenarios. The experimental research shows the following: (1) The BookGPT can achieve good recommendation results in existing classic book recommendation tasks. Especially in cases containing less information about the target object to be recommended, such as zero-shot or one-shot learning tasks, the performance of the BookGPT is close to or even better than that of the current classic book recommendation algorithms, and this method has great potential for improvement. (2) In text generation tasks such as book summary recommendation, the recommendation effect of the BookGPT model is better than that of the manual editing process of Douban Reading, and it can even perform personalized interpretable content recommendations based on readers’ attribute and identity information, making it more persuasive than interpretable one-size-fits-all recommendation models. Finally, we have open-sourced the relevant datasets and experimental codes, hoping that the exploratory program proposed in this paper can inspire the development of more LLMs to expand their applications and theoretical research prospects in the field of book recommendation and general recommendation tasks. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - This paper1 focuses on the implementation of a debate game using ChatGPT, aiming to investigate the feasibility of incorporating large language models into the educational domain through prompt engineering. The study explores strategies to elicit desired outputs from the GPT model by employing the prompt engineering methodology, as provided by Microsoft. Specifically, the game implementation involves the customization of ChatGPT's responses to facilitate a natural progression of debates, varying levels of difficulty, and an evaluation system for assessing the quality of discourse. By leveraging the prompt engineering methodology, we demonstrate that providing specific instructions or case-based prompts improves the accuracy and relevance of ChatGPT's answers. The developed application targets teenagers, enabling them to engage in real-time debates with ChatGPT and enhance their literacy skills. Furthermore, the game fosters the development of logical reasoning, persuasive abilities, effective expression, active participation, and attentive listening while expressing personal opinions, ultimately fostering a sense of accomplishment. Moreover, through debate evaluation and personalized advice, ChatGPT is expected to recognize and address its shortcomings, thereby continuously improving its conversational capabilities. Overall, this research contributes to the understanding of how large language models can be harnessed in educational settings and underscores the potential benefits of prompt engineering techniques in optimizing the outputs of such models.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - “Digital Hypertension” is a new research field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and proactively promotes research activities. This novel approach includes the development of new technologies for better BP management, such as sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning. To facilitate “Digital Hypertension,” a more sophisticated BP monitoring system capable of measuring an individual’s BP more frequently in various situations would be required. With the use of these technologies, hypertension management could shift from the current “dots” management based on office BP readings during clinic visits to a “line” management system based on seamless home BP or individual BP data taken by a wearable BP monitoring device.

AB  - This report describes the work submitted by the ZYZX-AI team to ICAGC 2024. This challenge, titled”Inspirational and Convincing Audio Generation Challenge 2024,” is part of the ISCSLP 2024 Competitions and Challenges track, aims to enhance the persuasiveness and acceptability of synthesized audio, focusing on human alignment convincing and inspirational audio generation. Our solution combines speech discretization, a language modeling approach, and waveform reconstruction by a vocoder based on speech tokens.First, the input audio is mapped to a sequence of discrete tokens, audio generation as a language modeling task in this representational space. Subsequently, a neural audio codec uses the predicted discrete speech tokens in conjunction with the text to be synthesized to achieve high-quality audio generation. These models are trained on diverse datasets including open-source corpora such as wenetspeech4TTS and magicData. Unlike speech recognition tasks, speech synthesis tasks require higher-quality annotations in their training datasets. To address this issue, methods such as speech enhancement, loudness processing, and adjustments to punctuation in text annotations are applied during the data preprocessing stage to improve data quality. Our submission achieved third place on the track1(Inspirational Emotion Modulation), with an average MOS value of 3.56. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - There is a growing need for public speaking skills in both professional and private life. With this background, our research project's long-term aims are to develop tools that can analyse public speeches and provide helpful feedback. The impact of audio and visual characteristics on the automatic analysis of speech quality has been widely explored in the existing literature. However, only a few studies have focused on textual features. In response to this shortcoming, this paper investigates the importance of textual content for the automatic analysis of public speaking. We created an open-source Python library of textual features and integrated them as inputs of simple machine-learning models for automatic public-speaking analysis, and persuasiveness prediction, in particular. The best result (accuracy of ) is obtained using a logistic regression. We then evaluated the impact of these features on persuasiveness prediction using both correlation analysis and Explainable AI methods. This evaluation was conducted on the French data set 3MT_French, including student performances in the "Ma Thèse en 180 Secondes"competition. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Introduction Pregnant and breastfeeding women are priority targets for COVID-19 vaccination due to adverse maternal and fetal consequences of perinatal COVID-19 infection and the opportunity for protecting infants through maternal antibodies. Saheli ('female friend') is a WhatsApp-deployed chatbot providing evidence-based guidance on COVID-19 for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Objectives To understand the feasibility and acceptability of Saheli and its impact on COVID-19 vaccination. Methods We pilot-tested Saheli among pregnant and breastfeeding participants of pre-existing WhatsApp educational groups led by a community-based non-governmental organisation in Haryana, India from January to March 2022 using a pre/post design. Results 829 unique participants completed precommunity surveys or postcommunity surveys; 238 completed both. 829 individuals used Saheli, including 88% postintervention survey participants. Users reported Saheli was easy to engage with (79%), easy to understand (91%), quick (83%) and met their information needs (97%). 89% indicated it improved their COVID-19 knowledge a lot, 72% recommended it to others and 88% shared chatbot-derived information with others. Most participants received ≥1 COVID-19 vaccine (86% vs 88%, preintervention to postintervention); full vaccination was 55% and 61%, respectively. Vaccination over time increased marginally for ≥1 dose (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.36) and significantly for 2 doses (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.34), and increases were significant among pregnant (≥1 dose) and breastfeeding participants (2 doses). Vaccine hesitancy was low. Chatbot use was high, yet individual chatbot engagement did not alter COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion Chatbots are a promising health education strategy due to high acceptability and deployment potential. Interpreting community chatbot impact must acknowledge the co-occurring constellation of multilevel interventions, community and pandemic factors.  © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2023.

AB  - Impregnating fabrics with shear thickening fluid (STF) improves impact resistance. In this study modification of polyethylene glycol (PEG 200) was carried out to enhance the thickening behavior of STF. The rheological analysis shows tunned STFs by PEG modification with glutaric acid and oxalic acid increase the maximum viscosity by about 10.33 and 3.28 folds with respect to unmodified STF. Additionally, the alternations of a liquid dispersion medium (PEG) led to higher chain length in STFs, representing superior interaction between media and particles by profuse H-bonding. The results confirmed that increasing the molecular length of PEG-based on STF caused a significant improvement in the knife and spike stabbing impact resistance, quasi-static, and yarn pull-out performance of the neat fabric. In addition, it was realized, by increasing impact velocity the energy absorption ability of STF-treated fabric composite increases. Additionally, a regression analysis using artificial intelligence was applied to study the effect of the pull-out rate on the mechanical response of different materials. Using a third-order polynomial for AI regression model, it turned out that while the pull-out rate has the least influence on untreated E-glass fabrics (UEG) response, for other materials, the behavior changes significantly by increasing the rate from 100 to 400 mm/min. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced both significant opportunities and challenges, with deepfake technology exemplifying the dual nature of AI’s impact. On the one hand, it enables innovative applications; on the other, it poses severe ethical and security risks. Deepfakes exploit human psychological vulnerabilities to manipulate perceptions, emotions, and behaviours, raising concerns about the public’s ability to dis-tinguish authentic content from manipulated material. This study examines the methods of influence embedded in deepfake content through the lens of Robert Cialdini’s six principles of persuasion. By systematically analysing how these mechanisms are employed in deepfakes, the research highlights their persuasive impact on human behaviour, particularly in scenarios such as financial fraud. To address the challenges posed by deepfake technology, this study introduces DEEP FRAME, an original tool for systematically recording and analysing deepfake content. DEEP FRAME integrates technical and psychological analysis, enabling the identification of technological characteristics and manipulation strategies embedded within deepfakes. The findings underscore the need for a holistic and interdisciplinary approach that combines technological innovation, psychological insights, and legal frameworks to counter the growing threat of deepfakes. © Some rights reserved.

AB  - Background and Aims: While many scholars have called attention to similarities between the earlier SSRI hype and the ongoing hype for psychedelic medications, the rhetoric of psychedelic hype is tinged with utopian and esoteric aspirations that have no parallel in the discourse surrounding SSRIs or other antidepressants. This utopian discourse provides insight into the ways that global tech elites are instrumentalizing both psychedelics and artificial intelligence (AI) as tools in a broader world-building project that justifies increasing material inequality. If realized, this project would undermine the use of both tools for prosocial and pro-environmental outcomes. Methods: My argument develops through rhetorical analysis of the ways that industry leaders envision the future of medicalized psychedelics in their public communications. I draw on examples from media interviews, blog posts, podcasts, and press releases to underscore the persuasive strategies and ideological commitments that are driving the movement to transform psychedelics into pharmaceutical medications. Results: Counterfactual efforts to improve mental health by increasing inequality are widespread in the psychedelics industry. These efforts have been propelled by an elitist worldview that is widely-held in Silicon Valley. The backbone of this worldview is the TESCREAL bundle of ideologies, which describes an interrelated cluster of belief systems: transhumanism, Extropianism, singularitarianism, cosmism, Rationalism, Effective Altruism, and longtermism. Conclusions: This article demonstrates that TESCREALism is a driving force in major segments of the psychedelic pharmaceutical industry, where it is influencing the design of extractive systems that directly contradict the field's world-healing aspirations. These findings contribute to a developing subfield of critical psychedelic studies, which interrogates the political and economic implications of psychedelic medicalization.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) experience multiple barriers to improving self-management. Evidence suggests that motivational interviewing (MI), a patient-centered communication method, can address patient barriers and promote healthy behavior. Despite the value of MI, existing MI studies predominantly used face-to-face or phone-based interventions. With the growing adoption of smartphones, automated MI techniques powered by artificial intelligence on mobile devices may offer effective motivational support to patients with T2DM. Objective: This study aimed to explore the perspectives of patients with T2DM on the acceptability of app-based MI in routine health care and collect their feedback on specific MI module features to inform our future intervention. Methods: We conducted semistructured interviews with patients with T2DM, recruited from public primary care clinics. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted using NVivo. Results: In total, 33 patients with T2DM participated in the study. Participants saw MI as a mental reminder to increase motivation and a complementary care model conducive to self-reflection and behavior change. Yet, there was a sense of reluctance, mainly stemming from potential compromise of autonomy in self-care by the introduction of MI. Some participants felt confident in their ability to manage conditions independently, while others reported already making changes and preferred self-management at their own pace. Compared with in-person MI, app-based MI was viewed as offering a more relaxed atmosphere for open sharing without being judged by health care providers. However, participants questioned the lack of human touch, which could potentially undermine a patient-provider therapeutic relationship. To sustain motivation, participants suggested more features of an ongoing supportive nature such as the visualization of milestones, gamified challenges and incremental rewards according to achievements, tailored multimedia resources based on goals, and conversational tools that are interactive and empathic. Conclusions: Our findings suggest the need for a hybrid model of intervention involving both app-based automated MI and human coaching. Patient feedback on specific app features will be incorporated into the module development and tested in a randomized controlled trial. © Sungwon Yoon, Haoming Tang, Chao Min Tan, Jie Kie Phang, Yu Heng Kwan, Lian Leng Low.

AB  - Digital marketing is being revolutionized by technological advancements in many fields, such as artificial intelligence and persuasive technologies. Persuasive technology still generates disagreements, both on the marketer side, by setting up a persuasive system, and on the consumer side, who is responsible for accepting and instilling. This chapter presents a case study, which focuses on a Portuguese sports betting app - Placard. The aim is to examine Placard gamblers' behaviors, attitudes, and preferences, and how their user experience is influenced by the persuasive technologies embedded in this app. The main results allow a conclude that, no matter how much persuasive technology is programmed, and designed to change a certain behavior, it will always depend on the user, as well as on the different factors that influence their decision. The persuasive sports betting platform itself also needs to provide a better user experience to trigger less resistance. These results are discussed for the benefit of future digital marketing strategies and tactics withing online gambling. © 2024, IGI Global. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persuasion is a human activity of influence. In marketing, persuasion can help customers find solutions to their problems, make informed choices, or convince someone to buy a useful (or useless) product or service. In computer crimes, persuasion can trick users into revealing sensitive information, or even performing actions that benefit attackers. Phishing is one of the most common and dangerous forms of persuasion-based attacks, as it exploits human vulnerabilities rather than technical ones. Therefore, an intelligent system capable of detecting and classifying persuasion attempts might be useful in protecting users. In this work, an approach that uses Machine Learning to analyze messages based on principles of persuasion and different data representations is presented. The aim of this research is to detect which data representation and which classification algorithm obtain the best results in detecting each principle of persuasion as a prior step to detecting phishing attacks. The results obtained indicate that among the combinations tested, there is one combination of data representation and classification algorithm that performs best. The related classification models obtained can detect the principles of persuasion at a rate that varies between 0.78 and 0.86 of AUC-ROC. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objectives Technology has substantial potential to transform and extend care for persons with chronic pain, a burdensome and costly condition. To catalyze the development of impactful applications of technology in this space, we developed the Pain Tech Landscape (PTL) model, which integrates pain care needs with characteristics of technological solutions. Methods Our interdisciplinary group representing experts in pain and human factors research developed PTL through iterative discussions. To demonstrate one potential use of the model, we apply data generated from a narrative review of selected pain and technology journals (2000-2020) in the form of heat map overlays, to reveal where pain tech research attention has focused to date. Results The PTL comprises three two-dimensional planes, with pain care needs on each x axis (measurement to management) and technology applications on the y axes according to a) user agency (user- to system-driven), b) usage time frame (temporary to lifelong), and c) collaboration (single-user to collaborative). Heat maps show that existing applications reside primarily in the "user-driven/management"quadrant (e.g., self-care apps). Examples of less developed areas include artificial intelligence and Internet of Things (i.e., Internet-linked household objects), and collaborative/social tools for pain management. Conclusions Collaborative development between the pain and tech fields in early developmental stages using the PTL as a common language could yield impactful solutions for chronic pain management. The PTL could also be used to track developments in the field over time. We encourage periodic reassessment and refinement of the PTL model, which can also be adapted to other chronic conditions.  © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Background: Text-generating artificial intelligence (AI) such as ChatGPT offers many opportunities and challenges in medical education. Acquiring practical skills necessary for using AI in a clinical context is crucial, especially for medical education. Objective: This explorative study aimed to investigate the feasibility of integrating ChatGPT into teaching units and to evaluate the course and the importance of AI-related competencies for medical students. Since a possible application of ChatGPT in the medical field could be the generation of information for patients, we further investigated how such information is perceived by students in terms of persuasiveness and quality. Methods: ChatGPT was integrated into 3 different teaching units of a blended learning course for medical students. Using a mixed methods approach, quantitative and qualitative data were collected. As baseline data, we assessed students’ characteristics, including their openness to digital innovation. The students evaluated the integration of ChatGPT into the course and shared their thoughts regarding the future of text-generating AI in medical education. The course was evaluated based on the Kirkpatrick Model, with satisfaction, learning progress, and applicable knowledge considered as key assessment levels. In ChatGPT-integrating teaching units, students evaluated videos featuring information for patients regarding their persuasiveness on treatment expectations in a self-experience experiment and critically reviewed information for patients written using ChatGPT 3.5 based on different prompts. Results: A total of 52 medical students participated in the study. The comprehensive evaluation of the course revealed elevated levels of satisfaction, learning progress, and applicability specifically in relation to the ChatGPT-integrating teaching units. Furthermore, all evaluation levels demonstrated an association with each other. Higher openness to digital innovation was associated with higher satisfaction and, to a lesser extent, with higher applicability. AI-related competencies in other courses of the medical curriculum were perceived as highly important by medical students. Qualitative analysis highlighted potential use cases of ChatGPT in teaching and learning. In ChatGPT-integrating teaching units, students rated information for patients generated using a basic ChatGPT prompt as “moderate” in terms of comprehensibility, patient safety, and the correct application of communication rules taught during the course. The students’ ratings were considerably improved using an extended prompt. The same text, however, showed the smallest increase in treatment expectations when compared with information provided by humans (patient, clinician, and expert) via videos. Conclusions: This study offers valuable insights into integrating the development of AI competencies into a blended learning course. Integration of ChatGPT enhanced learning experiences for medical students. © Anita V Thomae, Claudia M Witt, Jürgen Barth.

AB  - Communication plays an integral role in service interactions and language shapes how service agents talk to customers, salespeople talk to prospects, and chatbots talk to consumers. But as Danaher, Berry, Howard, Moore, and Attai (2023) note, given healthcare’s impact on quality of life, it’s a particularly important domain to study effective communication. Their useful review and framework should help medical professionals improve patient interactions and encourage future research. That said, one paper can only cover so much ground, and there are several additional areas that deserve further attention. Building on their framework, we offer some additional areas for future work, including how to use language to better understand patients, how communication mediums (e.g., writing vs. speaking or online portals vs. email) shape what gets communicated, and how effective communication depends on the interaction’s goals (e.g., persuasion vs. medical adherence). © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Conceptualizing how digital artifacts can function as a frontier mediated by technology in the geographical, physical, sensory, visual, discursive, and imaginary, this volume offers an interdisciplinary analysis of digital material circulating online in a way that creates a digital dimension of the Mexico-U.S. border. In the context of a world where digital media has helped to shape geopolitical borders and impacted human mobility in positive and negative ways, the book explores new modes of expression in which identification, memory, representation, persuasion, and meaning-making are created, experienced, and/or circulated through digital technologies. An interdisciplinary team of scholars looks at how quick communications bring closer transnational families and how online resources can be helpful for migrants, but also at how digital media can serve to control and reinforce borders via digital technology used to create a system of political control that reinforces stereotypes. The book deconstructs digital artifacts such as the digital press, social media, digital archives, web platforms, technological and artistic creations, visual arts, video games, and artificial intelligence to help us understand the anti-immigrant and dehumanizing discourse of control, as well as the ways migrants create vernacular narratives as digital activism to break the stereotypes that afflict them. This timely and insightful volume will interest scholars and students of digital media, communication studies, journalism, migration, and politics. © 2025 selection and editorial matter, Rubria Rocha de Luna and Maricruz Castro Ricalde; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - This conceptual paper starts with an account of modern societies who turned to objects in order to escape their overwhelming surroundings. It tracks how these objects evolved into mobile digital devices that, in an attention economy, paradoxically became objects that overwhelm attention and hamper cognitive abilities, ultimately affecting students’ learning. Through a philosophical analysis of persuasion, these persuasive technologies are presented as the main cause of declining motivation in learning. A theory synthesis on the brain’s predisposition to simplify cognitive processes, in order not to be overwhelmed, warrants the ease in which persuasive technologies have led to digital dementia. It then presents the 4P taxonomy of the four types of knowing and the four general types of memory as method theories to support embodied cognition in education through the postulate that the body precedes the mind when it comes to learning. The analysis leads to the hypothesis that artificial intelligence (AI) affects students, not by providing certainty, but by eliminating uncertainty and concludes that learning is in the inherent embodied skills used to reduce uncertainty. © 2024 Common Ground Research Networks.

AB  - The complex interplay between sleep-related information—both accurate and misleading—and its impact on clinical public health is an emerging area of concern. Lack of awareness of the importance of sleep, and inadequate information related to sleep, combined with misinformation about sleep, disseminated through social media, nonexpert advice, commercial interests, and other sources, can distort individuals’ understanding of healthy sleep practices. Such misinformation can lead to the adoption of unhealthy sleep behaviors, reducing sleep quality and exacerbating sleep disorders. Simultaneously, poor sleep itself impairs critical cognitive functions, such as memory consolidation, emotional regulation, and decision-making. These impairments can heighten individuals’ vulnerability to misinformation, creating a vicious cycle that further entrenches poor sleep habits and unhealthy behaviors. Sleep deprivation is known to reduce the ability to critically evaluate information, increase suggestibility, and enhance emotional reactivity, making individuals more prone to accepting persuasive but inaccurate information. This cycle of misinformation and poor sleep creates a clinical public health issue that goes beyond individual well-being, influencing occupational performance, societal productivity, and even broader clinical public health decision-making. The effects are felt across various sectors, from health care systems burdened by sleep-related issues to workplaces impacted by decreased productivity due to sleep deficiencies. The need for comprehensive clinical public health initiatives to combat this cycle is critical. These efforts must promote sleep literacy, increase awareness of sleep’s role in cognitive resilience, and correct widespread sleep myths. Digital tools and technologies, such as sleep-tracking devices and artificial intelligence–powered apps, can play a role in educating the public and enhancing the accessibility of accurate, evidence-based sleep information. However, these tools must be carefully designed to avoid the spread of misinformation through algorithmic biases. Furthermore, research into the cognitive impacts of sleep deprivation should be leveraged to develop strategies that enhance societal resilience against misinformation. Sleep infodemiology and infoveillance, which involve tracking and analyzing the distribution of sleep-related information across digital platforms, offer valuable methodologies for identifying and addressing the spread of misinformation in real time. Addressing this issue requires a multidisciplinary approach, involving collaboration between sleep scientists, health care providers, educators, policy makers, and digital platform regulators. By promoting healthy sleep practices and debunking myths, it is possible to disrupt the feedback loop between poor sleep and misinformation, leading to improved individual health, better decision-making, and stronger societal outcomes. © 2024 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Objective: Our primary goal was to measure the accuracy of fully automated absence seizure detection, using a wearable electroencephalographic (EEG) device. As a secondary goal, we also tested the feasibility of automated behavioral testing triggered by the automated detection. Methods: We conducted a phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04615442), with a prospective, multicenter, blinded study design. The input was the one-channel EEG recorded with dry electrodes embedded into a wearable headband device connected to a smartphone. The seizure detection algorithm was developed using artificial intelligence (convolutional neural networks). During the study, the predefined algorithm, with predefined cutoff value, analyzed the EEG in real time. The gold standard was derived from expert evaluation of simultaneously recorded full-array video-EEGs. In addition, we evaluated the patients' responsiveness to the automated alarms on the smartphone, and we compared it with the behavioral changes observed in the clinical video-EEGs. Results: We recorded 102 consecutive patients (57 female, median age = 10 years) on suspicion of absence seizures. We recorded 364 absence seizures in 39 patients. Device deficiency was 4.67%, with a total recording time of 309 h. Average sensitivity per patient was 78.83% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 69.56%–88.11%), and median sensitivity was 92.90% (interquartile range [IQR] = 66.7%–100%). The average false detection rate was.53/h (95% CI =.32–.74). Most patients (n = 66, 64.71%) did not have any false alarms. The median F1 score per patient was.823 (IQR =.57–1). For the total recording duration, F1 score was.74. We assessed the feasibility of automated behavioral testing in 36 seizures; it correctly documented nonresponsiveness in 30 absence seizures, and responsiveness in six electrographic seizures. Significance: Automated detection of absence seizures with a wearable device will improve seizure quantification and will promote assessment of patients in their home environment. Linking automated seizure detection to automated behavioral testing will provide valuable information from wearable devices. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Living with digital government is less of a technical issue but more of a political process. In political science, one new issue in need of greater theorizing and investigating is public anxiety about the use of big data and artificial intelligence (AI) by digital government which has become an emerging challenge for the country to obtain public support. Employing an online survey in China, we test whether technology anxiety influences public support for policy and examine the mechanisms within them, namely, political persuasion, interaction orientation, and people’s happiness. Survey evidence reveals that technology anxiety exerts a significantly negative effect on public support, especially in flexible employment and service industry. Additionally, technology anxiety indirectly influences public support for policy through the three abovementioned mechanisms, with political persuasion based on algorithm demonstrating the most pronounced mediating role. The findings contribute to understanding the relationship between public anxiety and political support in Chinese context and beyond, and enrich the studies of political psychology and legitimacy. © Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies 2024.

AB  - This book offers 117 concrete applicable behavior patterns for an improved user experience and conversion rate along the customer journey. The author explains how people decide, which unconscious behavior patterns they use, and how these can be addressed in digital marketing. Science now agrees that our brain works with two systems: an emotional-intuitive and a rational decision-making system. The rational system is provided with sufficient arguments in e-commerce, but accounts for only around 5% of all decisions! The remaining 95% of the customer's brain has so far been largely neglected. There, decisions are made based on deeply anchored, unconscious patterns of behavior – the so-called "behavior patterns". Knowledge of behavior patterns makes it possible to finally understand online customer behavior in depth. This reveals the opportunity to specifically improve the user experience and make your business more successful. The content • behavior patterns and how they can be used in the digital environment • improving the user experience and your conversion rate • library of 117 behavior patterns from awareness to retention • framework for identifying suitable behavior patterns • ethical-moral limits of use The translation was done with the help of artificial intelligence. A subsequent human revision was done primarily in terms of content. The author has subsequently revised the text further to refine the work stylistically and to make it more precise. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Fachmedien Wiesbaden GmbH, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - Background: Although physical activity (PA) has positive effects on health and well-being, physical inactivity is a worldwide problem. Mobile health interventions have been shown to be effective in promoting PA. Personalizing persuasive strategies improves intervention success and can be conducted using machine learning (ML). For PA, several studies have addressed personalized persuasive strategies without ML, whereas others have included personalization using ML without focusing on persuasive strategies. An overview of studies discussing ML to personalize persuasive strategies in PA-promoting interventions and corresponding categorizations could be helpful for such interventions to be designed in the future but is still missing. Objective: First, we aimed to provide an overview of implemented ML techniques to personalize persuasive strategies in mobile health interventions promoting PA. Moreover, we aimed to present a categorization overview as a starting point for applying ML techniques in this field. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the framework by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) criteria. Scopus, Web of Science, and PubMed were searched for studies that included ML to personalize persuasive strategies in interventions promoting PA. Papers were screened using the ASReview software. From the included papers, categorized by the research project they belonged to, we extracted data regarding general study information, target group, PA intervention, implemented technology, and study details. On the basis of the analysis of these data, a categorization overview was given. Results: In total, 40 papers belonging to 27 different projects were included. These papers could be categorized in 4 groups based on their dimension of personalization. Then, for each dimension, 1 or 2 persuasive strategy categories were found together with a type of ML. The overview resulted in a categorization consisting of 3 levels: dimension of personalization, persuasive strategy, and type of ML. When personalizing the timing of the messages, most projects implemented reinforcement learning to personalize the timing of reminders and supervised learning (SL) to personalize the timing of feedback, monitoring, and goal-setting messages. Regarding the content of the messages, most projects implemented SL to personalize PA suggestions and feedback or educational messages. For personalizing PA suggestions, SL can be implemented either alone or combined with a recommender system. Finally, reinforcement learning was mostly used to personalize the type of feedback messages. Conclusions: The overview of all implemented persuasive strategies and their corresponding ML methods is insightful for this interdisciplinary field. Moreover, it led to a categorization overview that provides insights into the design and development of personalized persuasive strategies to promote PA. In future papers, the categorization overview might be expanded with additional layers to specify ML methods or additional dimensions of personalization and persuasive strategies. © Annette Brons, Shihan Wang, Bart Visser, Ben Kröse, Sander Bakkes, Remco Veltkamp.

AB  - Background: Digital approaches may be helpful in augmenting care to address unmet mental health needs, particularly for schizophrenia and severe mental illness (SMI). Objective: An international multidisciplinary group was convened to reach a consensus on the challenges and potential solutions regarding collecting data, delivering treatment, and the ethical challenges in digital mental health approaches for schizophrenia and SMI. Methods: The consensus development panel method was used, with an in-person meeting of 2 groups: the expert group and the panel. Membership was multidisciplinary including those with lived experience, with equal participation at all stages and coproduction of the consensus outputs and summary. Relevant literature was shared in advance of the meeting, and a systematic search of the recent literature on digital mental health interventions for schizophrenia and psychosis was completed to ensure that the panel was informed before the meeting with the expert group. Results: Four broad areas of challenge and proposed solutions were identified: (1) user involvement for real coproduction; (2) new approaches to methodology in digital mental health, including agreed standards, data sharing, measuring harms, prevention strategies, and mechanistic research; (3) regulation and funding issues; and (4) implementation in real-world settings (including multidisciplinary collaboration, training, augmenting existing service provision, and social and population-focused approaches). Examples are provided with more detail on human-centered research design, lived experience perspectives, and biomedical ethics in digital mental health approaches for SMI. Conclusions: The group agreed by consensus on a number of recommendations: (1) a new and improved approach to digital mental health research (with agreed reporting standards, data sharing, and shared protocols), (2) equal emphasis on social and population research as well as biological and psychological approaches, (3) meaningful collaborations across varied disciplines that have previously not worked closely together, (4) increased focus on the business model and product with planning and new funding structures across the whole development pathway, (5) increased focus and reporting on ethical issues and potential harms, and (6) organizational changes to allow for true communication and coproduction with those with lived experience of SMI. This study approach, combining an international expert meeting with patient and public involvement and engagement throughout the process, consensus methodology, discussion, and publication, is a helpful way to identify directions for future research and clinical implementation in rapidly evolving areas and can be combined with measurements of real-world clinical impact over time. Similar initiatives will be helpful in other areas of digital mental health and similarly fast-evolving fields to focus research and organizational change and effect improved real-world clinical implementation. ©Katharine A Smith, Amy Hardy, Anastasia Vinnikova, Charlotte Blease, Lea Milligan, Diego Hidalgo-Mazzei, Sinéad Lambe, Lisa Marzano, Peter J Uhlhaas, Edoardo G Ostinelli, Gerard Anmella, Caroline Zangani, Rosario Aronica, Bridget Dwyer, John Torous, Andrea Cipriani.

AB  - As narratives shape public opinion and influence societal actions, distinguishing between truthful and misleading narratives has become a significant challenge. To address this, we introduce the EU DisinfoTest, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the efficacy of Language Models in identifying disinformation narratives. Developed through a Human-in-the-Loop methodology and grounded in research from EU DisinfoLab, the EU DisinfoTest comprises more than 1,300 narratives. Our benchmark includes persuasive elements under Logos, Pathos, and Ethos rhetorical dimensions. We assessed state-of-the-art LLMs, including the newly released GPT-4o, on their capability to perform zero-shot classification of disinformation narratives versus credible narratives. Our findings reveal that LLMs tend to regard narratives with authoritative appeals as trustworthy, while those with emotional appeals are frequently incorrectly classified as disinformative. These findings highlight the challenges LLMs face in nuanced content interpretation and suggest the need for tailored adjustments in LLM training to better handle diverse narrative structures. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - It remains unknown whether the virtual agents' implicit behaviors (e.g., the agent's eye-gaze shifting) would also cause such an observable effect on the users' experiences even when the users are not consciously aware of the implicit behaviors of the agents. More importantly, it is unclear whether the effect of the implicit behaviors of agents can be amplified as the agents' group size increases. To answer these questions, we asked two participant groups ($\mathrm{N}=12$ each) to deliver a public speech in front of the virtual agents showing either an explicit (head movement) or implicit (eye movement) behavior as we manipulated the agents' group sizes (small, medium, and large). We measured the users' perceptions, emotions, and behavior (head and eye movements) in the study. A posterior psychophysical experiment confirmed the implicit nature of the eye-movement behavior of the virtual agents (i.e., participants' detection rate of the eye movements was less than the chance level). The results showed that the explicit behavior of the virtual agents caused the expected participant behavior changes along with negative emotions. In contrast, the implicit behavior of the agents caused largely positive emotions, yet, without significant behavior changes of the participants. Most importantly, as the group size of the virtual agents increased, the degree of their effect on users increased in both the explicit head-movement condition and the implicit eye-movement condition. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Vaccination is a vital defense against COVID-19 infections and outbreaks, yet vaccine hesitancy poses a significant threat to pandemic response and recovery. We conducted a systematic review of published randomized controlled trials (N = 47) assessing the persuasive effects of COVID-19 communication on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Individual vs. collective appeals and gain vs. loss frames are among the most frequently assessed message features, but they generally do not make a difference in persuasion. Normative messages that highlight higher (vs. lower) prevalence of vaccine acceptance are more persuasive. Message sources overall have limited impact on COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, but sources that have a shared identity with the message receivers tend to be persuasive. More engaging message channels such as interactive chatbots and videos are promising communication tools but are generally under-utilized and under-studied. Compared to no communication or irrelevant communication, COVID-19 vaccine messages generally have a small advantage in increasing COVID-19 vaccine acceptance. Messages that include 1) vaccine safety and/or efficacy information; 2) collective appeals combined with embarrassment appeals; and 3) political leaders’ vaccine endorsement are among the most effective messaging strategies. There is no evidence of any backfire effects of COVID-19 vaccine messages. We discuss the implications of our findings for persuasive message design in pandemic vaccine communication. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Promotional videos are rapidly becoming a popular medium for persuading people to change their behaviours in many settings (e.g., online shopping, social enterprise initiatives). Today, such videos are often produced by professionals, which is a time-, labour- and cost-intensive undertaking. In order to produce such contents to support large applications (e.g., e-commerce), the field of artificial intelligence (AI)-empowered persuasive video generation (AIPVG) has gained traction in recent years. This field is interdisciplinary in nature, which makes it challenging for new researchers to grasp. Currently, there is no comprehensive survey of AIPVG available. In this paper, we bridge this gap by reviewing key AI techniques that can be utilized to automatically generate persuasive videos. We offer a first-of-its-kind taxonomy which divides AIPVG into three major steps: (1) visual material understanding, which extracts information from the visual materials (VMs) relevant to the target of promotion; (2) visual storyline generation, which shortlists and arranges high-quality VMs into a sequence in order to compose a storyline with persuasive power; and (3) post-production, which involves background music generation and still image animation to enhance viewing experience. We also introduce the evaluation metrics and datasets commonly adopted in the field of AIPVG. We analyze the advantages and disadvantages of the existing works belonging to the above-mentioned steps, and discuss interesting potential future research directions. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Chatbots (also known as conversational agents and virtual assistants) offer the potential to deliver healthcare in an efficient, appealing and personalised manner. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of chatbot interventions designed to improve physical activity, diet and sleep. Electronic databases were searched for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and pre-post trials that evaluated chatbot interventions targeting physical activity, diet and/or sleep, published before 1 September 2022. Outcomes were total physical activity, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality and sleep duration. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare intervention effects. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess chatbot type, intervention type, duration, output and use of artificial intelligence. Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Nineteen trials were included. Sample sizes ranged between 25–958, and mean participant age ranged between 9–71 years. Most interventions (n = 15, 79%) targeted physical activity, and most trials had a low-quality rating (n = 14, 74%). Meta-analysis results showed significant effects (all p < 0.05) of chatbots for increasing total physical activity (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.16, 0.40]), daily steps (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.17, 0.39]), MVPA (SMD = 0.53 [95% CI = 0.24, 0.83]), fruit and vegetable consumption (SMD = 0.59 [95% CI = 0.25, 0.93]), sleep duration (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI = 0.32, 0.55]) and sleep quality (SMD = 0.50 [95% CI = 0.09, 0.90]). Subgroup analyses showed that text-based, and artificial intelligence chatbots were more efficacious than speech/voice chatbots for fruit and vegetable consumption, and multicomponent interventions were more efficacious than chatbot-only interventions for sleep duration and sleep quality (all p < 0.05). Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that chatbot interventions are efficacious for increasing physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep duration and sleep quality. Chatbot interventions were efficacious across a range of populations and age groups, with both short- and longer-term interventions, and chatbot only and multicomponent interventions being efficacious. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Addiction in the brain is associated with adaptive changes that reshape addiction-related brain regions and lead to functional abnormalities that cause a range of behavioral changes, and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies can reveal complex dynamic patterns of brain functional change. However, it is still a challenge to identify functional brain networks and discover region-level biomarkers between nicotine addiction (NA) and healthy control (HC) groups. To tackle it, we transform the fMRI of the rat brain into a network with biological attributes and propose a novel feature-selected framework to extract and select the features of addictive brain regions and identify these graph-level networks. In this framework, spatial attention recurrent network (SARN) is designed to capture the features with spatial and time-sequential information. And the Bayesian feature selection(BFS) strategy is adopted to optimize the model and improve classification tasks by restricting features. Our experiments on the addiction brain imaging dataset obtain superior identification performance and interpretable biomarkers associated with addiction-relevant brain regions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Neurologists nowadays no longer view neurodegenerative diseases, like Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s disease, as single entities, but rather as a spectrum of multifaceted symptoms with heterogeneous progression courses and treatment responses. The definition of the naturalistic behavioral repertoire of early neurodegenerative manifestations is still elusive, impeding early diagnosis and intervention. Central to this view is the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in reinforcing the depth of phenotypic information, thereby supporting the paradigm shift to precision medicine and personalized healthcare. This suggestion advocates the definition of disease subtypes in a new biomarker-supported nosology framework, yet without empirical consensus on standardization, reliability and interpretability. Although the well-defined neurodegenerative processes, linked to a triad of motor and non-motor preclinical symptoms, are detected by clinical intuition, we undertake an unbiased data-driven approach to identify different patterns of neuropathology distribution based on the naturalistic behavior data inherent to populations in-the-wild. We appraise the role of remote technologies in the definition of digital phenotyping specific to brain-, body- and social-level neurodegenerative subtle symptoms, emphasizing inter- and intra-patient variability powered by deep learning. As such, the present review endeavors to exploit digital technologies and AI to create disease-specific phenotypic explanations, facilitating the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases as “bio-psycho-social” conditions. Not only does this translational effort within explainable digital phenotyping foster the understanding of disease-induced traits, but it also enhances diagnostic and, eventually, treatment personalization. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Society is undergoing a digital revolution. This is altering the business profiles of banks in terms of their systems, processes, controls and usage of third parties; their competitive landscape, ie competition from both digitising incumbents and new BigTech and FinTech entrants; and the behaviours of stakeholders, ranging from customers to cyber-criminals. This digital revolution is amplifying some of their existing risks, while also creating new risks, eg the potential for artificial intelligence (AI) tools to change behaviours over time (AI model drift). Some of these changes in operational risk profile will be transient, as they are associated with digital transformation, while others will be both ongoing and characterised by a high degree of dynamism. In this digitised endstate higher frequency/lower value human errors, may be replaced by lower frequency/higher impact systemic losses, arising from both catastrophic and silent failures. The influence of the digital revolution spans almost all of the Basel operational risk event categories, and may also lead to the enhancement of some controls (eg surveillance), while others may be undermined (eg by voice-spoofing). There is no silver bullet to mitigate these risks; instead, a portfolio of existing control frameworks need to be enhanced, including the following: change management; model risk management; third party vendor management; business continuity management, disaster recovery and operational resilience; and cybersecurity, with new controls required to address the new risks associated with AI. This will be a key factor in the operational risk losses of banks over the next decade. © Henry Stewart Publications 1752-8887 (2023).

AB  - The circular economy is used as a concept to advance and push the green and sustainability transition process in businesses to a more circular, green, resource effective economy. However, it has turned out to be much more complex to innovate, develop, implement, operate and not least measure Circular and Sustainable business models for businesses - especially for SME's and Startups - although the approach - by many - is emphasized as “easy” strategies and implementation. Achieving Circularity and Sustainability (environmentally, economically and socially parameters) - at the same time - related to business models has not yet been clearly defined, shown, proven and measured. Achieving environmental, economic and social goals - equal to sustainability - at the same time - the”triple bottom line” approach - in a circular perspective is a great dilemma to many businesses because the parameters often conflict each other. Advanced sensor technologies, 5G and 6g technologies gives great hope to be able to make it more visual and transparent to what businesses are really doing and strategically want to do. Advanced technology could help to visualize the process and the dilemma - in close to real time. Advanced sensor, 5G, 6G technologies imbedded in Business Model's (BM) and Circular Sustainable Multi Business Model Innovation and Development processes gives hopes for a new leadership and management era together with better measurement tools, practice, and approaches. It also gives hope to a higher speed on circular and sustainable transition - visualizing and thereby hopefully preventing greenwashing. The EU project Greenbizz II A and B's vision is to speed up the Circular and Sustainable Multi Business Model Innovation and Development (CSMBMID) process in SME's and Startups together with their business value network. The aim is to achieve and implement Scope 3 - but under the goal to also create at the same time effectiveness, efficiency and sociality in CSMBMID. By reengineering AS IS BM's - and designing Circular and Sustainable Business Models (CSBM) - the vision of Greenbizz II A and B are however very complex by nature. It requires a manifold of activities, different network constellations and not least further research, innovation and development of sensors, 5G and 6G technologies, learning and traning and a CSMBMID Brain. Greenbizz II A and B build on top of EU Greenbizz 1 project, as Green, Economic and Social parameters are seeked measured and achieved together with circularity at the same time in a new “Circular Sustainable Triple Bottom Line” measurement framework. A new advanced monitoring smartboard using advanced sensors and wireless technologies prototyped in SMEs/Startups - and their business value networks - will be prototyped and tried to be implemented from 2024-2026 in 96 SME and Startup businesses. The paper discuss through 3 case examples in different Business Model ecosystems contexts, challenges to do CSMBMID and how advance sensor, 5G and 6G technologies is expected to help and support circular sustainable BM transition in businesses. It points to how CSBM's can be innovated, developed and implemented supported by advance sensor, artificial intelligence, deep learning, persuasive technologies, Multi Business Model Innovation pattern analysis and libraries of BM archetypes. © 2024 River Publishers.

AB  - Parental permission is required for medical care for children, and decisions may be made without incorporating children’s views, even for adolescents. We explore the impact of including adolescents in virtual agent-based multiparty health counseling to promote Human Papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination. The agent is designed to encourage HPV vaccination for children aged 9-12 by engaging co-present parent/adolescent dyads in an online interaction. Several techniques are incorporated, including HPV education, motivational interviewing, persuasion, modeling, and enablement, to address parents’ intent to vaccinate their children. We conduct a between-subjects randomized study comparing a version of the agent exclusively for the parent, to one that includes the adolescent in the conversation and incorporates the child’s views in counseling strategies. We measure pre- and post-intervention changes in intent to vaccinate, vaccination hesitancy, and knowledge in both the parent and the adolescent, hypothesizing greater improvements in these measures when the adolescent is included in the conversation. We also examine the satisfaction, engagement, and comfort of the parent/child interactions with the virtual agent. We found significant pre-post increases in parent intent to vaccinate their adolescent for both versions of the agent. Our work provides insights into the effectiveness of the virtual agent in promoting HPV vaccination, the impact of child participation on healthcare decision-making, and the user experience of multi-party interaction with the virtual agent. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - By employing Aristotle's rhetoric as the theoretical framework, the present study aims to develop a model that automatically extracts the three key components of persuasive strategies-ethos (authority), pathos (emotional appeal), and logos (logic)-from answers to pertinent cancer questions on Quora, a social question and answer platform. Furthermore, we apply the model to discrete groups of the most upvoted and random (non-upvoted) answers to compare differences in the three persuasive components. The dataset consists of a total of 103 questions and their corresponding answers, including both upvoted and random answers. It was employed for preliminary findings, comprising a total of 33 questions and answers, with answers to 19 questions used as training data and answers to 14 questions used as test data. We annotated sentences in the answers according to the three types of rhetoric employed. We then fine-tuned models based on Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT) to classify the phrases, achieving an average F1 score of 0.84. Paired sample t-tests confirmed our research hypotheses regarding ethos and logos, while our hypothesis about pathos was not confirmed. Results suggest that ethos and logos are effective in communicating cancer information to consumers, but that pathos is not.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Complex decision-making problems, such as the privacy policy selection, when sharing content in online social network (OSN) platforms can significantly benefit from artificial intelligence systems. With the use of computational argumentation, it is possible to persuade human users to modify their initial decisions to avoid potential privacy threats and violations. In this paper, we present a study performed with the participation of 186 teenage users aimed at analyzing their behaviors when we try to persuade them to modify the post/publication of sensitive content on OSN platforms with different arguments. The results of the study revealed that the personality traits and the social interaction data (e.g., number of comment posts, friends, and likes) of our participants were significantly correlated with the persuasive power of the arguments. Therefore, these sets of features can be used to model OSN users and estimate the persuasive power of different arguments when used in human-computer interactions. The findings presented in this paper are helpful for personalizing decision support systems aimed at educating and preventing privacy violations on OSN platforms using arguments. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

AB  - The healthcare industry uses AI, because it is more efficient. In Indonesia, the accuracy of measurements and transmission of children's growth and development is often wrong. Many small hospitals usually don't have length measuring equipment, so the results are inaccurate. This research aims to determine the effectiveness of the stunting prevention program in Indonesia using an information system. The methodology used is a qualitative method, to conduct subjective research and analysis. The results of the research are to improve the website/mobile application information system which can display a child's growth and development history and simple educational information related to nutrition. Digital recording methods can speed up the process of updating data with a central database in real time. The value of this research is to reach the public to utilize technology and obtain personalized and interactive information directly to individuals. The theoretical implications of this research focus on information dissemination and understanding how chatbots influence knowledge acquisition and behavior change in the context of stunting prevention can contribute to advancing these theories in the field of public health. Managerial implications can provide cost effectiveness as Chatbots offer potentially cost-effective solutions and data-driven insights where managers can leverage chatbot analytics. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Due to recent shifts in the digital workplace, chat-based social engineering (CSE) attacks (Salahdine & Kaabouch, 2019) are receiving more attention. Persuasion is regarded as the catalyst for successful CSE attacks, and sophisticated CSE attacks target human personality traits. A convolutional neural network (CNN) and a multilayer perceptron comprise the task-specific neural network architecture proposed as the CSE-PUC (Tsinganos, Mavridis, & Gritzalis, 2022). By generating a probability distribution over the sentence classes, the classifier is tasked with determining whether a sentence is an influential payload (pp)-container and whether it carries a persuasive payload. The CNN was used as a feature extractor and later integrated with the rest of the architecture. The prediction task’s final result is the consequence of the thorough training of the entire CSE-PUC network. These patterns are made up of specific token set order sequences. The CNN uses sentences to feed a deep learning network architecture known as the CSE-PUC to identify such informative cues. The CSE corpus, which was created by collecting real-world and fictional social engineering attack dialogues from dark social engineering websites, social engineering books, and several logs, was used to train the CSE-PUC architecture. It created the CSE corpus with a few characteristics following a pre-processing pipeline, including tokenization, standardization, and noise removal. It clearly labeled the CSE corpus for the pp-container prediction task. Three thousand, eight hundred and eighty sentences were named as a pp-compartment. The final dataset had a good balance after it completed the annotation task. To enhance accuracy and context-awareness in chatbot responses, back propagation and an Apriori algorithm are used. It is essential to consider a combination of techniques that target different aspects of the chatbot’s operation. The work improves accuracy by 6.4% and context-awareness by 11.4% compared to previous efforts. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Dr Gururaj H L, Dr Janhavi V and Ambika V individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Background: Changing lifestyle patterns over the last decades have seen growing numbers of people in Asia affected by non-communicable diseases and common mental health disorders, including diabetes, cancer, and/or depression. Interventions targeting healthy lifestyle behaviours through mobile technologies, including new approaches such as chatbots, may be an effective, low-cost approach to prevent these conditions. To ensure uptake and engagement with mobile health interventions, however, it is essential to understand the end-users’ perspectives on using such interventions. The aim of this study was to explore perceptions, barriers, and facilitators to the use of mobile health interventions for lifestyle behaviour change in Singapore. Methods: Six virtual focus group discussions were conducted with a total of 34 participants (mean ± SD; aged 45 ± 3.6 years; 64.7% females). Focus group recordings were transcribed verbatim and analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach, followed by deductive mapping according to perceptions, barriers, facilitators, mixed factors, or strategies. Results: Five themes were identified: (i) holistic wellbeing is central to healthy living (i.e., the importance of both physical and mental health); (ii) encouraging uptake of a mobile health intervention is influenced by factors such as incentives and government backing; (iii) trying out a mobile health intervention is one thing, sticking to it long term is another and there are key factors, such as personalisation and ease of use that influence sustained engagement with mobile health interventions; (iv) perceptions of chatbots as a tool to support healthy lifestyle behaviour are influenced by previous negative experiences with chatbots, which might hamper uptake; and (v) sharing health-related data is OK, but with conditions such as clarity on who will have access to the data, how it will be stored, and for what purpose it will be used. Conclusions: Findings highlight several factors that are relevant for the development and implementation of mobile health interventions in Singapore and other Asian countries. Recommendations include: (i) targeting holistic wellbeing, (ii) tailoring content to address environment-specific barriers, (iii) partnering with government and/or local (non-profit) institutions in the development and/or promotion of mobile health interventions, (iv) managing expectations regarding the use of incentives, and (iv) identifying potential alternatives or complementary approaches to the use of chatbots, particularly for mental health. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the development of increasingly sophisticated chatbot technologies, with ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, gaining significant popularity. As public awareness of environmental issues has grown during recent decades, there is an increasing demand for access to information about the environment. ChatGPT which offers free, real-time information via a user-friendly interface, has the potential to fill this gap. However, empirical evaluations of reliability and quality of information provided by chatbots are needed. In this study, the biological information provided by GPT-3.5 is evaluated. The commonness indices of 199 bird species in Poland, estimated by the ChatGPT, are correlated with the real commonness indices obtained during ornithological survey conducted across 700 1 × 1 km squares. Bird commonness indices provided by ChatGPT were generally positively correlated (r ≤ 0.6) with bird abundance and occurrence. However, this correlation was not particularly strong. Correlation was especially poor for less common species (i.e., below 1000 individuals recorded during bird monitoring), and some of rare or very rare species were incorrectly identified by ChatGPT as relatively common. Moreover, ChatGPT seemed confident, realistic and persuasive in providing obviously incorrect responses (possibly due to lack of training data), much like it would for correct responses. Generating such false responses due to data deficiency is commonly referred to as “hallucination” of a chatbot. While chatbots can potentially be powerful tools for delivering environmental information, better control over the training process is necessary. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Oral health is closely related to general health and quality of life. School-aged children are at a critical stage for developing their self-care ability in oral health. Digital interventions can encourage and facilitate oral self-care in children. Objective: This study aims to present the development of an educational chatbot for school-aged children to address their oral self-care and evaluate its usability. Methods: The development and evaluation of the chatbot for oral self-care consisted of four stages: target behavior analysis, intervention design, system development, and the chatbot evaluation. The target behavior analysis identified barriers to children's engagement in oral self-care based on dentists’ clinical observations; hence, the requirements for achieving the desired behavior were categorized according to the capability-opportunity-motivation behavior model. Interventional functions were created following the behavior change wheel. A menu-driven chatbot was created and evaluated for usability as well as likeability. Results: The barriers and requirements for achieving good behavior in school-aged children's oral self-care were identified by the dental professionals. Intervention strategy incorporated specific functions enriched with gamification features to support school-aged children in developing their abilities for engaging in oral self-care. The intervention functions consist of capability establishment, motivation enhancement, and opportunity creation, which were designed to support children in their oral self-care practices. The designed chatbot was piloted with a convenient sample of 30 school-aged children and their accompanying parents at the pediatric dental clinic. The results indicated good usability, with a mean usability score of 79.91, and high likeability with a mean score of 4.32 out of 5 for the designed chatbot. Conclusions: The educational chatbot incorporated a combination of clinical dentistry practice and guidelines, aiming to promote oral self-care behavior in school-aged children. The designed chatbot achieved high scores for its usability and user likability. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This work focuses on the following question: is it possible to influence the behavior of self-interested agents through the strategic provision of information? This ‘sweet talk’ is ubiquitous among all sorts of economics and non-economics activities. In this work, we model these multi-agent systems as games between an informed sender and one or multiple receivers. We study the computational problem faced by an informed sender that wants to use his information advantage to influence rational receivers with the partial disclosure of information. In particular, the sender faces an information structure design problem that amounts to deciding ‘who gets to know what’. Bayesian persuasion provides a formal framework to model these settings as asymmetric-information games. In recent years, much attention has been given to Bayesian persuasion in the economics and artificial intelligence communities due also to the applicability of this framework to a large class of scenarios like online advertising, voting, traffic routing, recommendation systems, security, and product marketing. However, there is still a large gap between the theoretical study of information in games and its applications in real-world scenarios. This work contributes to close this gap along two directions. First, we study the persuasion problem in real-world scenarios, focusing on voting, routing, and auctions. While the Bayesian persuasion framework can be applied to all these settings, the algorithmic problem of designing optimal information disclosure polices introduces computational challenges related to the specific problem under study. Our goal is to settle the complexity of computing optimal sender’s strategies, showing when an optimal strategy can be implemented efficiently. Then, we relax stringent assumptions that limit the applicability of the Bayesian persuasion framework in practice. In particular, the classical model assumes that the sender has perfect knowledge of the receiver’s utility. We remove this assumption initiating the study of an online version of the persuasion problem. This is the first step in designing adaptive information disclosure policies that deal with the uncertainty intrinsic in all real-world applications. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - The global mental health epidemic is creating an urgent need for easily accessible and efficient mental health care. We know that, often times even though it is helpful traditional therapy can be inadequate in terms of accessibility, affordability and scalability. In this paper, we present TherapAI, a therapy chatbot using AI to keep track of user mood through sentiment analysis; offering personalised emotional support 24/7 whilst generating activity summaries for therapists. Through the use of sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP), TherapAI tracks behavioral patterns and assists users in managing emotional stress, thereby promoting behavior change. It provides therapists with comprehensive information and allows for real-time emotional assistance through the analysis of user interactions.This could lead to positive testing, with customers having shown more effective emotional control and reporting themselves as satisfied after spending time interacting with the chatbot. According to therapists, those automated reports are a valuable addition and the mood tracking tool provides great data points. As a scalable AI solution, TherapAI can supplement traditional therapy and alleviate substantial gaps in the existing delivery of mental health care. It can also be upgraded to perhaps allow more words in the future. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Policy mandates in addressing climate change are hindered by a lack of intrinsic motivation amongst participants to take collective action. Instead of overt persuasion, this study applied generative AI tools to speculative imagining of future climate scenarios and their adaptation strategies, using a workshop to encourage participants to align themselves with climate action. Participants used text-to-image tools to generate visions of the future in speculative scenarios, then prompted ChatGPT for potential solutions in these scenarios. They then asked text-to-image again to visualize the ChatGPT suggestions. Participants encountered difficulties editing or removing visual elements, dealt with the lack of transparency in the generation process by specifying the physical layout as opposed to the semantics, and collaboratively developed linguistic strategies for visual depiction of novel artifacts. This work shows how generative tools can be used to prototype future scenarios and envision designs that serve social purposes.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Next generation epidermal and wearable strain sensors are rapidly emerged as promising candidates for personalized medicine, soft machines, and human–machine interfaces. However, overshooting issues of these flexible strain sensors are major concerns during their dynamic strain monitoring, which often cause signal distortion and non-monotonic sensing characteristics. In addition, achieving a high sensitivtiy of these strain sensors within a full-body motion strain range (0–200%) remains a critical challenge. Herein, a conductive electrospun fibrous mats which are consisted of graphene anchored into fibrous thermoplastic polyurethane is proposed to endow strain sensors with anti-overshooting performance (or a good dynamic stability) and high sensitivity within full-body motion monitoring range. An overshooting-to-stable transition for the sensor's electrical performance is observed by controlling the contents of conductive agents and substrate, which is elucidated by the kinetic changing behaviors of conductive pathways along the longitudinal and transverse strain directions. By strengthening the interaction forces between fillers and matrix, the conduction pathways are capable of rapidly switching to disconnection in response to external strains, thus achieving an ultrahigh sensitivity. The developed skin sensing platform is capable of detecting full range physiological signals and achieving healthcare Internet of Things in achilles tendon rehabilitation. Furthermore, a wearable Morse code-to-speech translation system powered with deep learning algorithm was demonstrated, with high recognition accuracy (>98.5%) and fast response time (∼16 ms). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - AI in education is a topic that has been researched for the last 70 years. However, the last two years have seen very significant changes. These changes relate to the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot in November 2022. The GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model has dramatically influenced how the public approaches artificial intelligence. For many, generative language models have become synonymous with AI and have come uncritically viewed as a universal source of answers to most questions. However, it soon became apparent that even generative language models had their limits. Among the main problems that emerged was hallucination (providing answers containing false or misleading information), which is expected in all language models. The main problem of hallucination is that this information is difficult to distinguish from other information, and AI language models are very persuasive in presenting it. The risks of this phenomenon are much more substantial when using language modules to support learning, where the learner cannot distinguish correct information from incorrect information. The proposed paper focuses on the area of AI hallucination in mathematics education. It will first show how AI chatbots hallucinate in mathematics and then present one possible solution to counter this hallucination. The presented solution was created for the AI chatbot Edu-AI and designed to tutor students in mathematics. Usually, the problem is approached so that the system verifies the correctness of the output offered by the chatbot. Within the Edu-AI, checking responses is not implemented, but checking inputs is. If an input containing a factual query is recorded, it is redirected, and the answer is traced to authorised knowledge sources and study materials. If a relevant answer cannot be traced in these sources, a redirect to a natural person who will address the question is offered. In addition to describing the technical solution, the article includes concrete examples of how the system works. This solution has been developed for the educational domain but applies to all domains where users must be provided with relevant information. © 2024 Academic Conferences Limited.

AB  - Background: Rehabilitation is essential to optimize outcomes after surgical procedures in musculoskeletal disorders. However, adherence to rehabilitation continues to be an important barrier, since compliance with the programs is not always as desired, which may have a negative impact on clinical results. Methods: Randomized controlled trial aimed at to determining the effectiveness of using a virtual assistant (i.e., chatbot) to promote adherence to home rehabilitation. Overall, seventy patients under 75, undergoing total knee replacement, who have a personal smartphone and are familiar with its use, will be assigned into the control (standard care) or the experimental (standard care plus virtual assistant) group. Adherence (primary outcome) will be assessed three months after surgery. The WOMAC questionnaire, knee pain and system usability scale will be also outcomes of interest at three months and one year. Overall, an analysis of variance will look for possible time, group and time*group interactions. Discussion: The expected result is to determine whether the use of a chatbot that interacts with the patient can increase adherence to post-surgical home physiotherapy, and result in better clinical results (functional and pain) than standard care.

AB  - This chapter explores what artificial intelligence (AI) intellectual property (IP) owners do in their promotional material to negotiate public distrust of AI. A separation can be observed between the aesthetics and ethics of digital product design where simplified visual design appears to mask the complexity of AI-enabled devices, and systems. These observations can apply to the graphic design and corporate verbal rhetoric surrounding AI-enabled products. In this chapter, AI visual rhetoric is compared to science fiction aesthetics. Examples of masking complexity are described as visual echoes of the ‘Mr Fusion’ design from Back to the Future, while the few AI designs which declare their complexity more openly are described as reflecting ‘Johnny 5‘s’ design from Short Circuit. The authors delve into the nexus between the user experience (UX) of autonomous technology, its communication design, and the visual aesthetics used in its promotion as an emerging force. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Smart signage moves beyond traditional signage as it combines digital displays with Artificial Intelligence processes, Machine Learning attributes, and the use of Internet of Things consumer data. This chapter develops a conceptual model that illustrates both the dynamic nature of smart signs in retail contexts and the factors that coexist when consumers interact with this novel marketing communication tool. A set of new concepts and relationships are included in the model to reflect how smart signs two-way communication interface, technological characteristics, effects of psychological mechanism and privacy concerns, and formation of consumer-product relationships, all of which are useful in understanding smart signage persuasion effects. We foresee a fruitful avenue for research in the domain of smart signage and we discuss several implications for retail marketing, consumer wellbeing, and shopping experiences. © 2024.

AB  - Wearable digital technologies such as Augmented Reality glasses offer a unique platform not only for monitoring proxies of individual human behaviour data (e.g. eye and body limb movements, posture, location, skin conductivity) but also for affecting behaviour, as instances of persuasive technologies often used to achieve personal human goals, e.g. for integrating physical exercise into everyday life. For artificial computational systems to gracefully affect in-situ human behavior is however associated with several challenges. It requires carefully interfacing digital processes running on the wearable device(s) with biological processes taking place inside the human body (e.g. cognitive, perceptual, motoric). It also needs to work within the constraints of engineering viability, user experience, and ethical constraints. We present our initial attempts to synchronize human biological visual attention processes with eye tracking-based visual stimuli generation in two application domains: for counteracting racial discrimination in the assessment of job applications, and for facilitating assembly tasks. Characteristic for both approaches is that the persuasion is aimed at being completely unnoticeable, at least in the long-term. We then move on to initial ideas for a more general model for integrating perceptual and cognitive functions across the biological-digital border to optimize the system as a whole. More specifically, today’s AI architectures have a hard time achieving human-like high level cognition and perception which, we would argue, could potentially be addressed by a carefully designed symbiotic information exchange between existing human biological symbolic processes run inside the human brain with digital Machine Learning ones being tasked with the simpler sub-symbolic processing. Ethical concerns are, of course, also discussed including the potential reduction of “free will” and the consequences of system failure. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Memes are commonly used in online disinformation campaigns, particularly on social media platforms. They are primarily effective on social media platforms since they can easily reach many users. Semeval2024-Task4(Dimitrov et al., 2024), "Multilingual detection of persuasion techniques in memes", focuses on detecting persuasive methods across four languages: English, Bulgarian, North Macedonian and Arabic. Subtask 1 aims to identify the given text fragments of memes and which of the 20 persuasion techniques it uses, organized in a hierarchy. For the difficulty of this task and the fundamental role of text in the artificial intelligence area, we concentrate solely on this task. We develop a system using CoT-based data augmentation methods, in-domain pretraining and ensemble strategy that combines the strengths of both RoBERTa and DeBERTa models. Our solution achieved the top ranking among 33 teams in the English track during the official assessments. We also analyze the impact of architectural decisions, data construction and training strategies.

AB  - Social media is a pervasive platform for delivering targeted interventions, albeit with cautionary ethical consequences. Recently AI robots or “bots” have been combined with social media platforms to enhance interaction, and enact behavior change through increased engagement and adherence to intervention protocols. This paper presents a customized social media platform for promoting engagement and adherence to a prevention intervention protocol. The protocol was originally developed in a group workshop format, and then online during COVID-19. A social media platform was utilized to connect group participants and deliver protocol activities. Bots encouraged participation via positive reinforcement mechanism for the entire group, and to remind a participant of protocol activities. While not a formal study, our exploratory results demonstrate that bots and a social media context support a group leader in increased engagement and adherence to the protocol. Our principal contribution in this paper is demonstrating that a personalized, adaptive instance of a Control Systems Engineering model may improve engagement-related outcomes in brief protocols. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

Neuron. 2023;111(9):1440-1452.e5. doi:10.1016/j.neuron.2023.02.003. PMID: 36841241; PMCID: PMC10164063 Epilepsy is a major disorder affecting millions of people. Although modern electrophysiological and imaging approaches provide high-resolution access to the multi-scale brain circuit malfunctions in epilepsy, our understanding of how behavior changes with epilepsy has remained rudimentary. As a result, screening for new therapies for children and adults with devastating epilepsies still relies on the inherently subjective, semi-quantitative assessment of a handful of pre-selected behavioral signs of epilepsy in animal models. Here, we use machine learning-assisted 3D video analysis to reveal hidden behavioral phenotypes in mice with acquired and genetic epilepsies and track their alterations during post-insult epileptogenesis and in response to anti-epileptic drugs. These results show the persistent reconfiguration of behavioral fingerprints in epilepsy and indicate that they can be employed for rapid, automated anti-epileptic drug testing at scale. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Obesity is increasing in the pediatric population, and it represents an important risk factor for the life-long development of several diseases. Although health promotion represents the mainstay of obesity prevention and treatment, lifestyle modification programs are often unsuccessful. Objectives: The purpose of this article is to introduce the V-care app, a mobile health platform specifically developed to offer effective interaction and support young people in a long-term obesity treatment, combining different strategies to maximize the results of the lifestyle modification program and minimize the possibility of dropouts. Methods: The V-care app is based on a conventional client–server architecture, but novelties of our approach are the involvement of families in the lifestyle modification program, and the design inspired to psychological/behavioral change theories, with the aim of raising the chance of patients’ compliance to the program. V-care implements a goal-based behavioral intervention, providing specific feedbacks according to the patient's performance. A pilot usability and acceptability study was performed on a sample of thirteen children aged 6–12 years, using a questionnaire with a 5-points Likert scale to evaluate eight system features, identified as essential requirements based on the analysis of strengths and weaknesses of similar systems in literature. Results: The pilot study highlighted very high rate of overall friendliness and perceived utility evaluation, while some critical issues emerged especially for the chatbot section, which may be due to the novelty of the technology. The positive evaluation of the design choices is confirmed by the average score greater than 3 for all the questions. Conclusions: The V-care app represents a digital innovation in the pediatric healthcare, and it could be introduced in children's primary healthcare nationwide, with the aim to offer an intervention program for controlling and preventing childhood obesity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Data-driven storytelling serves as a crucial bridge for communicating ideas in a persuasive way. However, the manual creation of data stories is a multifaceted, labor-intensive, and case-specific effort, limiting their broader application. As a result, automating the creation of data stories has emerged as a significant research thrust. Despite advances in Artificial Intelligence, the systematic generation of data stories remains challenging due to their hybrid nature: they must frame a perspective based on a seed idea in a top-down manner, similar to traditional storytelling, while coherently grounding insights of given evidence in a bottom-up fashion, akin to data analysis. These dual requirements necessitate precise constraints on the permissible space of a data story. In this viewpoint, we propose integrating constraints into the data story generation process. Defined upon the hierarchies of interpretation and articulation, constraints shape both narrations and illustrations to align with seed ideas and contextualized evidence. We identify the taxonomy and required functionalities of these constraints. Although constraints can be heterogeneous and latent, we explore the potential to represent them in a computation-friendly fashion via Domain-Specific Languages. We believe that leveraging constraints will facilitate both artistic and scientific aspects of data story generation. © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - Objectives: Letters of recommendation (LORs) are essential within academic medicine, affecting a number of important decisions regarding advancement, yet these letters take significant amounts of time and labor to prepare. The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, are gaining popularity for a variety of academic writing tasks and offer an innovative solution to relieve the burden of letter writing. It is yet to be determined if ChatGPT could aid in crafting LORs, particularly in high-stakes contexts like faculty promotion. To determine the feasibility of this process and whether there is a significant difference between AI and human-authored letters, we conducted a study aimed at determining whether academic physicians can distinguish between the two. Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted using a single-blind design. Academic physicians with experience in reviewing LORs were presented with LORs for promotion to associate professor, written by either humans or AI. Participants reviewed LORs and identified the authorship. Statistical analysis was performed to determine accuracy in distinguishing between human and AI-authored LORs. Additionally, the perceived quality and persuasiveness of the LORs were compared based on suspected and actual authorship. Results: A total of 32 participants completed letter review. The mean accuracy of distinguishing between human- versus AI-authored LORs was 59.4%. The reviewer's certainty and time spent deliberating did not significantly impact accuracy. LORs suspected to be human-authored were rated more favorably in terms of quality and persuasiveness. A difference in gender-biased language was observed in our letters: human-authored letters contained significantly more female-associated words, while the majority of AI-authored letters tended to use more male-associated words. Conclusions: Participants were unable to reliably differentiate between human- and AI-authored LORs for promotion. AI may be able to generate LORs and relieve the burden of letter writing for academicians. New strategies, policies, and guidelines are needed to balance the benefits of AI while preserving integrity and fairness in academic promotion decisions. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This research focuses on the profound impact of the shocks caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on the accuracy of AI-based demand forecasting in the beauty care industry. It aims to understand the key factors that led to decreased forecasting accuracy during the pandemic and employs causal mediation analysis to systematically investigate this complex issue. The empirical analysis is conducted using extensive order data from a major beauty care product manufacturer and distributor, covering the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods. The findings reveal that it is primarily the increase in demand volatility, and not the surge in sales volume, that has led to an increase in forecasting errors. This research provides crucial insights into the nuanced effects of macroeconomic shocks and consumer behavior changes on AI-based forecasting within the beauty care industry. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms that drive forecasting errors, paving the way for more resilient and robust demand forecasting systems in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Goal-setting is often used in eHealth applications for behavior change as it motivates and helps to stay focused on a desired outcome. However, for goals to be effective, they need to meet criteria such as being specific, measurable, attainable, relevant and time-bound (SMART). Moreover, people need to be confident to reach their goal. We thus created a goal-setting dialog in which the virtual coach Jody guided people in setting SMART goals. Thereby, Jody provided personalized vicarious experiences by showing examples from other people who reached a goal to increase people’s confidence. These experiences were personalized, as it is helpful to observe a relatable other succeed. Data from an online study with a between-subjects with pre-post measurement design (n=39 participants) provide credible support that personalized experiences are seen as more motivating than generic ones. Motivational factors for participants included information about the goal, path to the goal, and the person who accomplished a goal, as well as the mere fact that a goal was reached. Participants also had a positive attitude toward Jody. We see these results as an indication that people are positive toward using a goal-setting dialog with a virtual coach in eHealth applications for behavior change. Moreover, contrary to hypothesized, our observed data give credible support that participants’ self-efficacy was lower after the dialog than before. These results warrant further research on how such dialogs affect self-efficacy, especially whether these lower post-measurements of self-efficacy are associated with people’s more realistic assessment of their abilities. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Do LLMs have political leanings and are LLMs able to shift our political views? This paper explores these questions in the context of the 2024 U.S. presidential election. Through a voting simulation, we demonstrate 18 open-weight and closed-source LLMs' political preference for Biden over Trump. We show how Biden-leaning becomes more pronounced in instruction-tuned and reinforced models compared to their base versions by analyzing their responses to political questions related to the two nominees. We further explore the potential impact of LLMs on voter choice by recruiting 935 U.S. registered voters. Participants interacted with LLMs (Claude-3, Llama-3, and GPT-4) over five exchanges. Intriguingly, although LLMs were not asked to persuade users to support Biden, about 20% of Trump supporters reduced their support for Trump after LLM interaction. This result is noteworthy given that many studies on the persuasiveness of political campaigns have shown minimal effects in presidential elections. Many users also expressed a desire for further interaction with LLMs on political subjects. Further research on how LLMs affect users' political views is required, as their use becomes more widespread. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Manipulation is a concern in many domains, such as social media, advertising, and chatbots. As AI systems mediate more of our digital interactions, it is important to understand the degree to which AI systems might manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Our work clarifies challenges in defining and measuring this kind of manipulation from AI systems. Firstly, we build upon prior literature on manipulation and characterize the space of possible notions of manipulation, which we find to depend upon the concepts of incentives, intent, covertness, and harm. We review proposals on how to operationalize each concept and we outline challenges in including each concept in a definition of manipulation. Second, we discuss the connections between manipulation and related concepts, such as deception and coercion. We then analyze how our characterization of manipulation applies to recommender systems and language models, and give a brief overview of the regulation of manipulation in other domains. While some progress has been made in defining and measuring manipulation from AI systems, many gaps remain. In the absence of a consensus definition and reliable tools for measurement, we cannot rule out the possibility that AI systems learn to manipulate humans without the intent of the system designers. Manipulation could pose a significant threat to human autonomy and precautionary actions to mitigate it are likely warranted. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - This article includes a systematic review that identifies and summarizes the many behavioral change techniques (BCTs), behavioral health theories, and advanced techniques based on artificial intelligence (AI) currently used to manage diabetes. The review focuses on assessing the efficacy of diabetes self-care applications that leverage these cutting-edge techniques in their development and use. The study provides the latest comprehensive review and the findings of the report through the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 reporting guidelines. After carefully reviewing and choosing pertinent studies from well-known bibliographic databases, the review finds that self-care treatments favor behavior change, blood glucose reduction, healthier habits, and substantial weight loss. According to the results, investigations that use these methodologies and ideas and AI-based ones are more likely to succeed. The evaluation ends by highlighting its shortcomings and outlining potential future research and application design areas. It also highlights the possibility of incorporating BCT methodologies, theories, and AI-based techniques in creating self-management interventions. The knowledge gained from this systematic review can help application developers create frameworks for effective diabetes self-care interventions based on the identified cutting-edge techniques. © 2023

AB  - Existing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques support people in interpreting AI advice. However, although previous work evaluates the users’ understanding of explanations, factors influencing the decision support are largely overlooked in the literature. This article addresses this gap by studying the impact of user uncertainty, AI correctness, and the interaction between AI uncertainty and explanation logic-styles for classification tasks. We conducted two separate studies: one requesting participants to recognize handwritten digits and one to classify the sentiment of reviews. To assess the decision making, we analyzed the task performance, agreement with the AI suggestion, and the user’s reliance on the XAI interface elements. Participants make their decision relying on three pieces of information in the XAI interface (image or text instance, AI prediction, and explanation). Participants were shown one explanation style (between-participants design) according to three styles of logical reasoning (inductive, deductive, and abductive). This allowed us to study how different levels of AI uncertainty influence the effectiveness of different explanation styles. The results show that user uncertainty and AI correctness on predictions significantly affected users’ classification decisions considering the analyzed metrics. In both domains (images and text), users relied mainly on the instance to decide. Users were usually overconfident about their choices, and this evidence was more pronounced for text. Furthermore, the inductive style explanations led to overreliance on the AI advice in both domains—it was the most persuasive, even when the AI was incorrect. The abductive and deductive styles have complex effects depending on the domain and the AI uncertainty levels. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s)

AB  - Introduction: Respiratory diseases encompass a diverse range of conditions that significantly impact global morbidity and mortality. While common diseases like asthma and COPD exhibit moderate symptoms, less prevalent conditions such as pulmonary hypertension and cystic fibrosis profoundly affect quality of life and mortality. The prevalence of these diseases has surged by approximately 40% over the past 3 decades. Despite advancements in pharmacotherapy, challenges in drug administration, adherence, and adverse effects persist. This study aimed to develop and perform an interim validation of a Capacity-Motivation-Opportunity (CMO) model tailored for respiratory outpatients to enhance pharmaceutical care, which is the direct, responsible provision of medication-related care for the purpose of achieving definite outcomes that improve a patient’s quality of life, and overall wellbeing. Methodology: This cross-sectional, multicenter study was conducted from March 2022 to March 2023. It comprised four phases: 1) forming an expert panel of 15 hospital pharmacists, 2) selecting respiratory pathologies based on prevalence and severity, 3) developing the CMO model’s pillars, and 4) integrating and conducting an interim validation of the model. The Capacity pillar focused on patient stratification and personalized care; the Motivation pillar aligned therapeutic goals through motivational interviewing; and the Opportunity pillar promoted the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for telemedicine. Results: The model included eight respiratory diseases based on expert assessment. For the Capacity pillar, 22 variables were defined for patient stratification, leading to three priority levels for personalized pharmaceutical care. In a preliminary test involving 201 patients across six hospitals, the stratification tool effectively classified patients according to their needs. The Motivation pillar adapted motivational interviewing techniques to support patient adherence and behavior change. The Opportunity pillar established teleconsultation protocols and ICT tools to enhance patient monitoring and care coordination. Conclusion: The CMO model, tailored for respiratory patients, provides a comprehensive framework for improving pharmaceutical care. By focusing on patient-centered care, aligning therapeutic goals, and leveraging technology, this model addresses the multifaceted needs of individuals with respiratory conditions. Future studies are necessary to validate this model in other healthcare systems and ensure its broad applicability.

AB  - We describe an AI-powered chatbot to aid with health improvement by generating Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) cue texts that should reduce delay discounting. In prior studies, EFT has been shown to address maladaptive health behaviors. Those studies involved participants, working with researchers, vividly imagining future events, and writing a description that they subsequently will frequently review, to ensure a shift from an inclination towards immediate rewards. That should promote behavior change, aiding in health tasks such as treatment adherence and lifestyle modifications. The AI chatbot is designed to guide users in generating personalized EFT cues, automating the current labor-intensive interview-based process. This can enhance the efficiency of EFT interventions and make them more accessible, targeting specifically those with limited educational backgrounds or communication challenges. By leveraging AI for EFT intervention, we anticipate broadened access and improved health outcomes across diverse populations. ©2024 IEEE.

AB  - With advancements in generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology, there is a growing concern about its ethical implications, transparency, and consumer reactions to AI-generated content. Building on the persuasion knowledge model and algorithm aversion literature, this study explores the effects of AI disclosure in prosocial advertising on consumer attitudes and donation intentions. The findings of Study 1 indicate that the initial disclosure of AI-generated content leads to unfavourable attitudes towards ads, with perceived ad credibility serving as a mediating factor. In Study 2, participants who perceived AI as more human-like rather than machine-like tended to experience a diminished negative impact of AI disclosure. Study 3 also highlights the crucial role of perceived ad credibility in influencing donation intentions following the disclosure of AI-generated content. The theoretical and practical implications of our findings for social marketers and nonprofit organizations are discussed further. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Depression, or major depressive disorder (MDD), is a widespread mental health condition marked by enduring feelings of sorrow and loss of interest. Treatment of depression frequently combines psychotherapy, medication, and lifestyle modifications. However, the occurrence of treatment resistance in certain individuals makes it difficult for physicians to effectively manage this disorder, calling for the implementation of alternative therapeutic strategies. Recently, precision medicine has gained increased attention in the field of mental health, paving the way for more personalized and effective therapeutic interventions in depression. Also known as personalized medicine, this approach relies on genetic composition, molecular profiles, and environmental variables to customize therapies to individual patients. In particular, precision medicine has offered novel viewpoints on depression through two specific domains: proteomics and metabolomics. On one hand, proteomics is the thorough study of proteins in a biological system, while metabolomics focuses on analyzing the complete set of metabolites in a living being. In the past few years, progress in research has led to the identification of numerous depression-related biomarkers using proteomics and metabolomics techniques, allowing for early identification, precise diagnosis, and improved clinical outcome. However, despite significant progress in these techniques, further efforts are required for advancing precision medicine in the diagnosis and treatment of depression. The overarching goal of this chapter is to provide the current state of knowledge regarding the use of proteomics and metabolomics in identifying biomarkers related to depression. It also highlights the potential of proteomics and metabolomics in elucidating the intricate processes underlying depression, opening the door for tailored therapies that could eventually enhance clinical outcome in depressed patients. This chapter finally discusses the main challenges in the use of proteomics and metabolomics and discusses potential future research directions. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.

AB  - Personalization is an essential tactic for enhancing social networking advertising (SNA) effectiveness. Brands leverage consumer data using artificial intelligence (AI) to pinpoint target audiences based on distinct behavioral and psychographic traits. This study examines the comparative effectiveness of behavioral and psychographic personalization, with a focus on impression motivation as a key moderator. Results from an online experiment involving 455 Facebook users showed that behavioral personalization significantly increased consumer digital engagement intentions, while psychographic personalization influenced consumers’ attitudes toward SNA and the advertised brands, contingent on the social desirability of the psychographic factors involved. Impression motivation proved to be a crucial factor in determining the success of psychographic personalization. These findings provide valuable insights into SNA personalization and offer practitioners empirical guidance to develop optimal SNA personalization strategies. © 2024 American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - The boardgame Diplomacy is a challenging setting for communicative and cooperative artificial intelligence. The most prominent communicative Diplomacy AI, Cicero, has excellent strategic abilities, exceeding human players. However, the best Diplomacy players master communication, not just tactics, which is why the game has received attention as an AI challenge. This work seeks to understand the degree to which Cicero succeeds at communication. First, we annotate in-game communication with abstract meaning representation to separate in-game tactics from general language. Second, we run two dozen games with humans and Cicero, totaling over 200 human-player hours of competition. While AI can consistently outplay human players, AI-Human communication is still limited because of AI's difficulty with deception and persuasion. This shows that Cicero relies on strategy and has not yet reached the full promise of communicative and cooperative AI. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - In the age of artificial intelligence (AI), trust in AI systems is becoming more important. Explainable recommenders, which explain why an item is recommended, have recently been proposed in the field of learning technology to improve transparency, persuasiveness, and trustworthiness. However, the methods for generating explanations are limited and do not consider the learner’s cognitive perceptions or personality. This study draws inspiration from tailored intervention research in public health and investigates the effectiveness of personality-based tailored explanations by implementing them for the recommended quizzes in an explainable recommender system. High school students (n = 217) were clustered into three distinct profiles labeled Diligent (n = 77), Fearful (n = 72), and Agreeable (n = 68), based on the Big Five personality traits. The students were divided into a tailored intervention group (n = 106) and a control group (n = 111). In the tailored intervention group, personalized explanations for recommended quizzes were provided based on student profiles, with explanations based on quiz characteristics. In the control group, only non-personalized explanations based on quiz characteristics were provided. An 18-day A/B experiment showed that the tailored intervention group had significantly higher recommendation usage than the control group. These results suggest that personality-based tailored explanations with a recommender approach are effective for e-learning engagement and imply improved trustworthiness of AI learning systems. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) technology has enabled AI agents to take on various roles as communicators, such as virtual assistants, robot journalists, and AI doctors. This study meta-analyzed 121 randomized experimental studies (N ¼ 53,977) that compared the effects of AI and human agency on persuasion outcomes, including perceptions, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors. The results showed that AI agents were as persuasive as humans in terms of overall persuasion outcomes. With regard to different types of outcomes, AI was less effective than humans at shaping behavioral intentions, but did not differ significantly from humans in eliciting perceptions, attitudes, or actual behaviors. Additionally, heterogeneous patterns were observed for different roles of AI communicators, directions of communication, experimental settings, and demographic segments. The implications of these findings for human-machine communication and persuasion in the era of AI are discussed. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Objective: Physical inactivity is a leading modifiable cause of death and disease worldwide. Population-based interventions to increase physical activity are needed. Existing automated expert systems (e.g., computer-tailored interventions) have significant limitations that result in low long-term effectiveness. Therefore, innovative approaches are needed. This special communication aims to describe and discuss a novel mHealth intervention approach that proactively offers participants with hyper-personalised intervention content adjusted in real-time. Methods: Using machine learning approaches, we propose a novel physical activity intervention approach that can learn and adapt in real-time to achieve high levels of personalisation and user engagement, underpinned by a likeable digital assistant. It will consist of three major components: (1) conversations: to increase user's knowledge on a wide range of activity-related topics underpinned by Natural Language Processing; (2) nudge engine: to provide users with hyper-personalised cues to action underpinned by reinforcement learning (i.e., contextual bandit) and integrating real-time data from activity tracking, GPS, GIS, weather, and user provided data; (3) Q&A: to facilitate users asking any physical activity related questions underpinned by generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Bard) for content generation. Results: The detailed concept of the proposed physical activity intervention platform demonstrates the practical application of a just-in-time adaptive intervention applying various machine learning techniques to deliver a hyper-personalised physical activity intervention in an engaging way. Compared to traditional interventions, the novel platform is expected to show potential for increased user engagement and long-term effectiveness due to: (1) using new variables to personalise content (e.g., GPS, weather), (2) providing behavioural support at the right time in real-time, (3) implementing an engaging digital assistant and (4) improving the relevance of content through applying machine learning algorithms. Conclusion: The use of machine learning is on the rise in every aspect of today's society, however few attempts have been undertaken to harness its potential to achieve health behaviour change. By sharing our intervention concept, we contribute to the ongoing dialogue on creating effective methods for promoting health and well-being in the informatics research community. Future research should focus on refining these techniques and evaluating their effectiveness in controlled and real-world circumstances. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - Recommender systems have become indispensable tools in the hotel hospitality industry, enabling personalized and tailored experiences for guests. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, and persuasive technologies have opened new avenues for enhancing the effectiveness of those systems. This paper explores the potential of integrating ChatGPT and persuasive technologies for automating and improving hotel hospitality recommender systems. First, we delve into the capabilities of ChatGPT, which can understand and generate human-like text, enabling more accurate and context-aware recommendations. We discuss the integration of ChatGPT into recommender systems, highlighting the ability to analyze user preferences, extract valuable insights from online reviews, and generate personalized recommendations based on guest profiles. Second, we investigate the role of persuasive technology in influencing user behavior and enhancing the persuasive impact of hotel recommendations. By incorporating persuasive techniques, such as social proof, scarcity, and personalization, recommender systems can effectively influence user decision making and encourage desired actions, such as booking a specific hotel or upgrading their room. To investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT and persuasive technologies, we present pilot experiments with a case study involving a hotel recommender system. Our inhouse commercial hotel marketing platform, eXclusivi, was extended with a new software module working with ChatGPT prompts and persuasive ads created for its recommendations. In particular, we developed an intelligent advertisement (ad) copy generation tool for the hotel marketing platform. The proposed approach allows for the hotel team to target all guests in their language, leveraging the integration with the hotel’s reservation system. Overall, this paper contributes to the field of hotel hospitality by exploring the synergistic relationship between ChatGPT and persuasive technology in recommender systems, ultimately influencing guest satisfaction and hotel revenue. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: Long-term management of healthcare information for chronic patients such as Alzheimer's is complex and tedious. An electronic Personal Health Record (ePHR) can help patients by maintaining a history of healthcare data from various centers. The purposes of this research were to develop a minimum data set (MDS) to design an ePHR for caregivers of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) using design science methodology and to identify the necessary measures for a smooth ePHR implementation in Iran. Methods: This study was performed in Kerman from February 2020 to October 2021. To inform caregivers about ePHRs, information sessions were held and a pictorial method was used. Then, 20 semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven physicians and 13 caregivers involved in the care of Alzheimer's patients. Using thematic analysis based on the Information System Research (ISR) framework, the data were encoded and analyzed. Results: The MDS of an ePHR for AD contained 178 data elements, categorized into six main sections. The participants considered the use of an ePHR essential to achieve quality care. Using an ePHR can serve as the main method of collecting accurate histories of each Alzheimer's patient in different disease stages and monitoring their behavioral changes. Data confidentiality and security were considered as one of the main measures for AD ePHR implementation. Conclusion: This study identified an AD-specific MDS, as the first major step in launching ePHRs for Alzheimer's patients in the future. The MDS was developed based on the requirements of neurologists and caregivers. © 2023 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine

AB  - Information pollution (i.e., misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation) has become a global threat to democracies and the ability to govern as well as the well-being of individuals. Legacy media organizations have historically been the primary source of news and information about important topics that affect citizens’ lives. In the U.S. people no longer have a shared sense of truth because information pollution has led to mistrust of journalists, journalism, and major institutions. Social media and political advertising play a role in the spread of information pollution. Media effects theories help explain how people can be susceptible to information pollution. While information communications technology (ICT) has exacerbated the proliferation of information pollution, evidence has shown that technology can play a prominent role in designing interventions, including inoculating individuals against its effects. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - This proposed study investigates the factors that influence susceptibility to deepfake phishing, a modern technique that employs artificial intelligence to create realistic but fake content. Due to the unique nature of social media, we believe that it provides an ample opportunity for attackers to target users that can expect to see well-known individuals on the platforms they use. By focusing on the content of the deepfakes, such as perceived authority, familiarity, and video quality, this paper explores how differences might affect susceptibility. This research utilizes an experimental approach to test the differences in content across a randomized sample of participants. By merging cognitive theories with empirical data, this paper seeks to provide insight into the dynamics of persuasion, deception, and phishing susceptibility in this new digital age, aiming to enhance detection strategies and reduce vulnerability to such sophisticated attacks. © 2024 30th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2024.

AB  - In the next few years, people will be called upon to try to slow climate change and achieve carbon neutrality collectively. The use of persuasive digital tools and engaging mechanisms can play an important role in matching such objectives. In our research, we explore the usage of a Multimodal Conversational Agent embedded in a Smart Mirror and connected to home automation appliances to help users reduce their energy consumption. The agent employs a variety of gamification techniques to encourage short and long-term sustainable behavior, and it is designed to be an enjoyable and non-intrusive experience. It informs householders about their energy consumption and encourages them regularly to reduce and optimize their electric usage. In order to keep the user engaged, the mirror contains visually appealing components and recommendations for daily challenges.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Viral marketing relies on a set of users who have characteristics to rapidly increase the propagation of information. In viral marketing, information reaches and is shared by the public at large rather than a targeted audience. Thus, the study of influence spread for viral marketing needs the interest of researchers. Influence maximization challenges such as large graph and NP-hard problem have created a need to reconfigure this research issue. The selection of an influential set of users is a well-known influence maximization research problem which is a discrete problem. Therefore, at the beginning of this work, the standard BAT algorithm is transformed into a discrete BAT algorithm (DBAT). Further, a novel discrete BAT-modified (DBATM) algorithm is introduced as an optimized solution to the influence maximization problem. To validate the influence spread performance of the proposed DBATM algorithm, three diverse datasets are experimented using two social network influence maximization techniques—page rank and node rank—and two computational intelligence algorithms—DBAT and DBATM. Experimental outcomes illustrate and posit the fast convergence and maximum influence spread using the computational intelligence optimization algorithm DBATM over all other considered techniques. Even, DBATM performs better than DBAT in terms of the stability as well. Hence, the proposed optimization DBATM algorithm used for the detection of influential users is effective and persuasive for viral marketing. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Digital health interventions (DHI) potentially improve the efficiency and effectiveness of dermatological care. Currently, an overview clustering and characterizing the evidence on DHIs is missing. This systematic mapping of the literature aims to analyse published research on DHIs in dermatology to identify trends and gaps in research. For this purpose, a systematic search of the MEDLINE database was conducted in August 2022 to identify original publications on DHIs in dermatology. Data on country, targeted audience, DHI category, indication, outcome parameter and study design were extracted. Out of 12,009 records identified in MEDLINE, 403 studies were included in the final analysis. Studies on DHIs mainly performed in western countries, headed by the United States (n = 133), Germany (n = 32) and Spain (n = 23). Of all identified DHIs, 261 targeted healthcare providers (HCP), 66 clients (e.g. patients, caregivers, healthy individuals) and 67 both clients and HCPs. A majority of DHIs focussed on establishing a diagnosis (n = 254). Every other study analysed store-and-forward teledermatology (n = 187), followed by artificial intelligence applications for image analysis (n = 65). The most often analysed DHI category for clients was a support of health behaviour change (n = 31). Monitoring of clients was targeted by 77 studies. Skin cancer (n = 148), wounds (n = 29) and psoriasis (n = 29) were the most targeted indications by DHIs. Most studies analysed diagnostic performance (n = 166), fewer studies analysed acceptance (n = 92) and effectiveness (n = 98). Usability (n = 32) and efficiency (n = 36) were investigated only to a small extent. Studies on DHIs in dermatology have focused on teledermatology and AI applications, with an emphasis on skin cancer diagnosis. Apart from that, a range of DHIs for different user groups, purposes and indications were identified, demonstrating the broad potential for DHIs in dermatology. Further research with a wider set of outcome parameters is needed to fully understand the potential of DHIs and ensure their sustainable implementation into dermatological care. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Configuration systems play an important role in achieving the sustainable development goals (SDGs) defined by the United Nations. As decision support systems, configurators help users to decide which components or features to include in or exclude from a configuration. An important task of configurators is the provision of explanations which help to achieve goals such as increasing configuration understandability, increasing a user’s trust, and persuading users/customers to include specific configuration components. Our goal in this paper is to introduce the concept of „sustainability-aware explanations“which can help to support the sustainable development goals. The type of explanations we propose in this context are somehow orthogonal to typical explanations used in industrial configuration environments. A major objective in this context is to follow a „less-is-more“principle focusing on different aspects of the idea of „responsible configuration“which refers to configuration techniques explicitly supporting the mentioned sustainability goals. We report the initial results of an evaluation that provide insights on potential impacts of the proposed explanations. © 2024 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Introduction Many hospital presentations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) occur in people previously hospitalised with coronary heart disease (CHD), leading to increased costs and health burden. Secondary prevention education including a prehospital discharge plan is recommended for all individuals to reduce the risk of recurrence. However, many clinicians lack the time or support to provide education, and patients' uptake of secondary prevention programmes is limited. An avatar-based education app is a novel and engaging way to provide self-delivered, evidence-based secondary prevention information during the hospital admission and remains accessible after discharge. This protocol aims to evaluate the effect of an avatar-based education app on individuals with ACS. Methods and analysis This protocol describes a prospective, randomised controlled trial with 3-month follow-up and blinded assessment of 72 participants. Intervention group participants will download the app onto their own device during the hospital admission and independently complete six interactive education modules based on the National Heart Foundation's six steps to cardiac recovery. All participants will receive a text message reminder of the study after 3 weeks. Both groups will receive usual care consisting of bedside education and a pamphlet about cardiac rehabilitation. The primary outcome is knowledge of CHD, assessed using the Coronary Artery Disease Education Questionnaire II. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, response to heart attack symptoms, cardiac-related readmissions and mortality and modifiable cardiac risk factors. Engagement with the app will be evaluated objectively. Intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, with between-group comparisons and 95% CIs of the primary outcome analysed using analysis of covariance, adjusting for baseline values. Ethics and dissemination This study protocol has been approved by the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee. The results of this study will be disseminated via a peer-reviewed journal and research thesis.

AB  - In argumentative writing, writers must brainstorm hierarchical writing goals, ensure the persuasiveness of their arguments, and revise and organize their plans through drafting. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have made interactive text generation through a chat interface (e.g., ChatGPT) possible. However, this approach often neglects implicit writing context and user intent, lacks support for user control and autonomy, and provides limited assistance for sensemaking and revising writing plans. To address these challenges, we introduce VISAR, an AI-enabled writing assistant system designed to help writers brainstorm and revise hierarchical goals within their writing context, organize argument structures through synchronized text editing and visual programming, and enhance persuasiveness with argumentation spark recommendations. VISAR allows users to explore, experiment with, and validate their writing plans using automatic draft prototyping. A controlled lab study confirmed the usability and effectiveness of VISAR in facilitating the argumentative writing planning process.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Human-in-the-loop (“HITL”) approaches have been proposed as an important element to ensure safety and fairness for higher-risk applications of artificial intelligence (“AI”) enabled decision-making. This paper examines the question: To what extent does the current state of knowledge enable the definition of factors and mitigations necessary for the effective implementation of HITL approaches? Previous research examining internal (individual) and external (implementation-related structural and contextual) factors in human decision-making are surveyed and assessed for potential relevance. This analysis highlights factors likely to be of relevance and reveals gaps which hinder the elaboration of factors and mitigations relevant to the effectiveness of HITL approaches. In order to realize the potential for HITL approaches to enhance safety for those reliant on or subject to AI systems, governance implementation will need to include minimum requirements applicable to both human overseers and to the context in which they work and are assessed. Factors identified as relevant include: complacency, persuasion, workload, conformity, unequal treatment of different kinds of error, and organizational polices and norms which may deter thorough review and human challenge of AI recommendations. There is also a need for further research: to enhance understanding of the practical significance of HITL effectiveness risks factors and their management; to enable the classification of HITL-implementation environments; and, to provide robust measurement methodologies to enable the identification of the most promising human candidates for HITL overseer roles. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - At first thought, iteration seems banal. It is about repeating the existing; nothing is changing. But this special issue shows that, in an era obsessed with the new, it is often the repetition of the old that creates social change. Iteration fosters persuasion. It affords opportunities for critical and creative engagement with meaning, values and knowledge. It invites collaboration, though its apparent simplicity often belies a tremendous amount of individual and collective labour involved in the practices of iteration. Through its repetition of the existing, however, iteration also can be a mechanism for reproducing the status quo. Its pervasiveness and banality naturalises power, and its mimetic qualities shrink spaces for critical distance and care. The editors of this special issue have brought together a delightful and fascinating diversity of articles focussed on iteration in cultural production in the digital age. We hop across geographies to examine lockdown diaries, artists’ books, socialist memes, fake news, the design of social media platforms and artificial intelligence, activism, film, social media forum moderation, news website reader comments and more. Iterating through the collection as a whole, across its many disciplines, is a commitment to theorising through empirical evidence, to explaining with critique, and to providing pathways to praxis. These characteristics of this special issue, and the many concepts and arguments it puts forward, make this collection of work exceptionally rich material for seeing iteration and how it shapes the world we live in today, as well as the world we want it to be. In this preface, I take a media sociology approach to show how iteration can be usefully understood as collaborative communication for change. I see this understanding of iteration, whose ascendancy is related to the ascendancy of computer science, as baked into the form of communication technologies—and thus as shaping the kinds of iteration that are possible when we use these technologies. This understanding also prompts us to focus on the connection between iteration and social change. To explore how this works, I analytically slow down the practice of iteration to show that it is a communication practice of transmission. That transmission practice is itself constituted of cognate communication practices—the reception, evaluation and production of knowledge—in which visibility and persuasion are key. In the latter parts of the preface, I illustrate this through the example of witnessing as iteration, as the high-stakes nature of witnessing make it a canary in the coalmine, more generally, for mediated communication in the digital age. I show how breaking the witnessing practice down into its various parts allows us to see how power enters and inflects who and what are iterated, when—and who and what are not. Thinking critically with iteration and against unequal power relations, the praxis this preface suggests is one—much in line with the rest of this special issue—of explaining how iteration might move the grassroots towards their goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: There is a lack of understanding of the potential utility of a chatbot integrated into a website to support healthy eating among young adults. Therefore, the aim was to interview key informants regarding potential utility and design of a chatbot to: (1) increase young adults’ return rates and engagement with a purpose-built healthy eating website and, (2) improve young adults’ diet quality. Methods: Eighteen qualitative, semi-structured interviews were conducted across three stakeholder groups: (i) experts in dietary behaviour change in young adults (n = 6), (ii) young adult users of a healthy eating website (n = 7), and (iii) experts in chatbot design (n = 5). Interview questions were guided by a behaviour change framework and a template analysis was conducted using NVivo. Results: Interviewees identified three potential roles of a chatbot for supporting healthy eating in young adults; R1: improving healthy eating knowledge and facilitating discovery, R2: reducing time barriers related to healthy eating, R3: providing support and social engagement. To support R1, the following features were suggested: F1: chatbot generated recommendations and F2: triage to website information or externally (e.g., another website) to address current user needs. For R2, suggested features included F3: nudge or behavioural prompts at critical moments and F4: assist users to navigate healthy eating websites. Finally, to support R3 interviewees recommended the following features: F5: enhance interactivity, F6: offer useful anonymous support, F7: facilitate user connection with content in meaningful ways and F8: outreach adjuncts to website (e.g., emails). Additional ‘general’ chatbot features included authenticity, personalisation and effective and strategic development, while the preferred chatbot style and language included tailoring (e.g., age and gender), with a positive and professional tone. Finally, the preferred chatbot message subjects included training (e.g., would you like to see a video to make this recipe?), enablement (e.g., healthy eating doesn’t need to be expensive, we’ve created a budget meal plan, want to see?) and education or informative approaches (e.g., “Did you know bananas are high in potassium which can aid in reducing blood pressure?”). Conclusion: Findings can guide chatbot designers and nutrition behaviour change researchers on potential chatbot roles, features, style and language and messaging in order to support healthy eating knowledge and behaviours in young adults. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Over the past two decades, dialogue modeling has made significant strides, moving from simple rule-based responses to personalized and persuasive response generation. However, despite these advancements, the objective functions and evaluation metrics for dialogue generation have remained stagnant. These lexical-based metrics, e.g., cross-entropy and BLEU, have two key limitations: (a) word-to-word matching without semantic consideration: It assigns the same credit for failure to generate “nice” and “rice” for “good”, (b) missing context attribute for evaluating the generated response: Even if a generated response is relevant to the ongoing dialogue context, it may still be penalized for not matching the gold utterance provided in the corpus. In this paper, we first investigate these limitations comprehensively and propose a new loss function called Semantic Infused Contextualized diaLogue (SemTextualLogue) loss function. We also formulate an evaluation metric called Dialuation, incorporating both context and semantic relevance. We experimented with both non-pretrained and pre-trained models on two dialogue corpora, encompassing task-oriented and open-domain scenarios. We found that the dialogue generation models trained with SemTextualLogue loss attained superior performance compared to the traditional cross-entropy loss function. Tshe findings establish that the effective training of a dialogue generation model hinges significantly on incorporating semantics and context. This pattern is also mirrored in the introduced Dialuation metric, where the consideration of both context and semantics correlates more strongly with human evaluation compared to traditional metrics (The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/NLP-RL/SemTextualLogue-Loss). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.

AB  - Healthcare systems worldwide rely on voluntary blood donations, as blood cannot be produced artificially, but is needed for many surgeries and treatments. In countries like South Africa or Ghana, currently less than 1 % of the population donates blood. Donor education, mobilisation and management are therefore crucial. Chatbots offer easy access to information for all types of donors as well as for blood services to educate (potential) donors. By applying the design science research approach and grounding our research on behaviour change models, we have developed a chatbot for all donor types in South Africa and Ghana. In this work, we present an instantiation of the chatbot and its positive evaluation with non-, first-time, lapsed and regular donors of both countries. © 2024 IEEE Computer Society.

AB  - With the recent advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT from OpenAI, BARD from Google, Llama2 from Meta, and Claude from Anthropic AI, gain widespread use, ensuring their security and robustness is critical. The widespread use of these language models heavily relies on their reliability and proper usage of this fascinating technology. It is crucial to thoroughly test these models to not only ensure its quality but also possible misuses of such models by potential adversaries for illegal activities such as hacking. This paper presents a novel study focusing on exploitation of such large language models against deceptive interactions. More specifically, the paper leverages widespread and borrows well-known techniques in deception theory to investigate whether these models are susceptible to deceitful interactions. This research aims not only to highlight these risks but also to pave the way for robust countermeasures that enhance the security and integrity of language models in the face of sophisticated social engineering tactics. Through systematic experiments and analysis, we assess their performance in these critical security domains. Our results demonstrate a significant finding in that these large language models are susceptible to deception and social engineering attacks.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to ascertain how real options investment perspective could be applied towards monetization of customer futures through the deployment of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)-based persuasive technologies. Design/methodology/approach: The authors embarked on a theoretical treatise as advocated by scholars (Cornelissen, 2019; Barney, 2018; Cornelissen, 2017; Smithey Fulmer, 2012; Bacharach, 1989; Whetten, 1989; Weick,1989). Towards this end, theoretical argumentative logic was incrementally used to build an integrated perspective on the deployment of learning and AI-based persuasive technologies. This was carried out with strategic real options investment perspective to secure customer futures on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Findings: M-commerce apps and e-commerce sites have been deploying ML and AI-based tools (referred to as persuasive technologies), to nudge customers for increased and quicker purchase. The primary objective was to increase engagement time of customers (at an individual level), grow the number of customers (at market level) and increase firm revenue (at an organizational level). The deployment of any persuasive technology entailed increased investment (cash outflow) but was also expected to increase the level of revenue and margin (cash inflow). Given the dynamics of market and the emergent nature of persuasive technologies, ascertaining favourable cash flow was challenging. Real options strategy provided a robust theoretical perspective to time the persuasive technology-related investment in stages. This helped managers to be on time with loading customer purchase with increased temporal immediacy. A real options investment space involving six spaces has also been developed in this conceptual work. These were Never Invest, Immediately Investment, Present-day Investment Possibility, Possibly Invest Later, Invest Probably Later and Possibly Never Invest. Research limitations/implications: The foundations of this study domain encompassed work done by an eclectic mix of scholars like from technology management (Siggelkow and Terwiesch, 2019a; Porter and Heppelmann, 2014), real options (Trigeorgis and Reuer, 2017; Luehrman, 1998a, 1998b), marketing intelligence and planning (Appel et al., 2020; Thaichon et al., 2019; Thaichon et al., 2020; Ye et al., 2019) and strategy from a demand positioning school of thought (Adner and Zemsky, 2006). Practical implications: The findings would help managers to comprehend what level of investments need to be done in a staggered manner. The phased way of investing towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies would enable better monetization of customer futures. This would aid marketing managers for increased customer engagement at the individual level, fast monetization of customer futures and increased number of customers and consumption on m-commerce apps and e-commerce sites. Originality/value: This was one of the first studies to apply real options investment perspective towards the deployment of ML and AI-based persuasive technologies for monetizing customer futures. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Despite the broad application of chatbot agents in online interactions, an ongoing debate persists regarding their persuasive role and human-like emotional disclosure. Our study adds to this debate by exploring the effect of chatbot agents’ emotional disclosure on people's willingness to donate to a charitable cause, and by examining individual and serial mediation between the main effects of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. To this end, two types of artificial intelligence chatbot agents—one disclosing factual information and another disclosing human-like emotion—were developed and trained using Dialogflow, a natural language processing engine. A total of 619 US residents were recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Of these, 593 participants completed the required conversation with either version of the chatbot agent (factual vs. emotional), as well as the survey questionnaire, and therefore, were included in the final analysis. The participants exhibited a higher willingness to donate when they interacted with a chatbot disclosing human-like emotions than when they were only exposed to factual information. Moreover, this study found both individual and serial mediating roles of perceived anthropomorphism and social presence. Concerning the implications, theoretically, this study adds to the understanding of applying the notion of human interaction to that involving humans and chatbots. Practically, our findings can be of great help in increasing willingness to donate thereby enhancing fund-raising activities. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Recent research has focused on using large language models (LLMs) to generate explanations for hate speech through fine-tuning or prompting. Despite the growing interest in this area, these generated explanations' effectiveness and potential limitations remain poorly understood. A key concern is that these explanations, generated by LLMs, may lead to erroneous judgments about the nature of flagged content by both users and content moderators. For instance, an LLM-generated explanation might inaccurately convince a content moderator that a benign piece of content is hateful. In light of this, we propose an analytical framework for examining hate speech explanations and conducted an extensive survey on evaluating such explanations. Specifically, we prompted GPT-3 to generate explanations for both hateful and non-hateful content, and a survey was conducted with 2,400 unique respondents to evaluate the generated explanations. Our findings reveal that (1) human evaluators rated the GPT-generated explanations as high quality in terms of linguistic fluency, informativeness, persuasiveness, and logical soundness, (2) the persuasive nature of these explanations, however, varied depending on the prompting strategy employed, and (3) this persuasiveness may result in incorrect judgments about the hatefulness of the content. Our study underscores the need for caution in applying LLM-generated explanations for content moderation.

AB  - Large language models have abilities in creating high-volume human-like texts and can be used to generate persuasive misinformation. However, the risks remain under-explored. To address the gap, this work first examined characteristics of AI-generated misinformation (AI-misinfo) compared with human creations, and then evaluated the applicability of existing solutions. We compiled human-created COVID-19 misinformation and abstracted it into narrative prompts for a language model to output AI-misinfo. We found significant linguistic differences within human-AI pairs, and patterns of AI-misinfo in enhancing details, communicating uncertainties, drawing conclusions, and simulating personal tones. While existing models remained capable of classifying AI-misinfo, a significant performance drop compared to human-misinfo was observed. Results suggested that existing information assessment guidelines had questionable applicability, as AI-misinfo tended to meet criteria in evidence credibility, source transparency, and limitation acknowledgment. We discuss implications for practitioners, researchers, and journalists, as AI can create new challenges to the societal problem of misinformation. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Mobile smoking-cessation apps are widely available. Apps of good quality are based on smoking-cessation guidelines and/or behaviour-change techniques, and ideally should be proven effective in improving smoking-cessation outcomes. Mobile interventions using text messages are effective in improving outcomes, while internet-based interventions are moderately effective. Some smoking-cessation apps show a positive effect on smoking-cessation outcomes, especially among users who use the app as intended. Combining digital interventions with usual smoking-cessation support appears beneficial and feasible, but evidence on effectiveness is mixed. Relatively little is known about using digital approaches to support smoking cessation in people with COPD. Novel developments in digital smoking-cessation support include use of artificial intelligence and conversational agents. © ERS 2023.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the perception of different types of AI-based assistance and the interaction of radiologists with the algorithm’s predictions and certainty measures. Methods: In this retrospective observer study, four radiologists were asked to classify Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System 4 (BI-RADS4) lesions (n = 101 benign, n = 99 malignant). The effect of different types of AI-based assistance (occlusion-based interpretability map, classification, and certainty) on the radiologists’ performance (sensitivity, specificity, questionnaire) were measured. The influence of the Big Five personality traits was analyzed using the Pearson correlation. Results: Diagnostic accuracy was significantly improved by AI-based assistance (an increase of 2.8% ± 2.3%, 95 %-CI 1.5 to 4.0 %, p = 0.045) and trust in the algorithm was generated primarily by the certainty of the prediction (100% of participants). Different human-AI interactions were observed ranging from nearly no interaction to humanization of the algorithm. High scores in neuroticism were correlated with higher persuasibility (Pearson’s r = 0.98, p = 0.02), while higher consciousness and change of accuracy showed an inverse correlation (Pearson’s r = −0.96, p = 0.04). Conclusion: Trust in the algorithm’s performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the predictions in combination with a plausible heatmap. Human-AI interaction varied widely and was influenced by personality traits. Key Points: • AI-based assistance significantly improved the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists in classifying BI-RADS 4 mammography lesions. • Trust in the algorithm’s performance was mostly dependent on the certainty of the prediction in combination with a reasonable heatmap. • Personality traits seem to influence human-AI collaboration. Radiologists with specific personality traits were more likely to change their classification according to the algorithm’s prediction than others. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Valuable insights into an individual's current thoughts and stance regarding behaviour change can be obtained by analysing the language they use, which can be conceptualized using Motivational Interviewing concepts. Training conversational agents (CAs) to detect and employ these concepts could help them provide more personalized and effective assistance. This study investigates the similarity of written language around behaviour change spanning diverse conversational and social contexts and change objectives. Drawing on previous research that applied MI concepts to texts about health behaviour change, we evaluate the performance of existing classifiers on six newly constructed datasets from diverse contexts. To gain insights in determining factors when identifying change language, we explore the impact of lexical features on classification. The results suggest that patterns of change language remain stable across contexts and domains, leading us to conclude that peer-to-peer online data may be sufficient to train CAs to understand user utterances related to behaviour change.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the influence of emerging digital technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing, on the digital intensity index (DII). The research method employed involves quantitative analysis of the indicators regarding DII and emerging digital technologies, conducted based on data published by Eurostat for EU members in 2021. During our research, we formulated and tested hypotheses about the relationship between the DII and emerging digital technologies, and the effect on the DII of using AI-based technologies in various economic processes. The formulated hypotheses were validated via four regression models designed during this study, using the most relevant factors. Our research results demonstrate that the DII is positively influenced by emerging IoT and cloud computing digital technologies, as well as the use of AI technologies based on machine learning and AI-based robotic process automation (RPA) software. Furthermore, the same positive influence was identified in human resource management and recruitment processes compared to the intensity with which these technologies are used in other economic processes. Based on these findings, this study offers persuasive arguments for implementing emerging digital technologies at the EU organizational level to achieve significant increases in digitalization levels. © 2023 by the authors.

This paper describes the rationale for, and development of, “LvL UP 1.0″, a smartphone-based lifestyle intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. Materials and Methods: A multidisciplinary team led the intervention design process of LvL UP 1.0, involving four phases: (i) preliminary research (stakeholder consultations, systematic market reviews), (ii) selecting intervention components and developing the conceptual model, (iii) whiteboarding and prototype design, and (iv) testing and refinement. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy and the UK Medical Research Council framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions were used to guide the intervention development. Results: Preliminary research highlighted the importance of targeting holistic wellbeing (i.e., both physical and mental health). Accordingly, the first version of LvL UP features a scalable, smartphone-based, and conversational agent-delivered holistic lifestyle intervention built around three pillars: Move More (physical activity), Eat Well (nutrition and healthy eating), and Stress Less (emotional regulation and wellbeing). Intervention components include health literacy and psychoeducational coaching sessions, daily “Life Hacks” (healthy activity suggestions), breathing exercises, and journaling. In addition to the intervention components, formative research also stressed the need to introduce engagement-specific components to maximise uptake and long-term use. LvL UP includes a motivational interviewing and storytelling approach to deliver the coaching sessions, as well as progress feedback and gamification. Offline materials are also offered to allow users access to essential intervention content without needing a mobile device. Conclusions: The development process of LvL UP 1.0 led to an evidence-based and user-informed smartphone-based intervention aimed at preventing NCDs and CMDs. LvL UP is designed to be a scalable, engaging, prevention-oriented, holistic intervention for adults at risk of NCDs and CMDs. A feasibility study, and subsequent optimisation and randomised-controlled trials are planned to further refine the intervention and establish effectiveness. The development process described here may prove helpful to other intervention developers. 2023 Castro, Mair, Salamanca-Sanabria, Alattas, Keller, Zheng, Jabir, Lin, Frese, Lim, Santhanam, van Dam, Car, Lee, Tai, Fleisch, von Wangenheim, Tudor Car, Müller-Riemenschneider and Kowatsch.

AB  - The artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT was used to answer questions from final exams administered in two general chemistry courses, including questions with closed-response format and with open-response format. For closed-response questions, ChatGPT was very capable at identifying the concept even when the question included a great deal of chemical symbolism. However, ChatGPT’s success at solving problems was only 44%, a value well below the class average of 69%. On open-response questions, ChatGPT’s responses displayed strong language processing ability with higher performance on questions that could be solved with more generalizable information compared to questions that required specific skills, especially when those topics or skills were primarily found in lecture. Incorrect responses and flawed explanations were often logically sound and would be persuasive to a novice. The chatbot is currently ill-equipped to provide reliable answers or explanations to students for many representative exam questions, but a potential use is to create assignments in which students analyze and improve ChatGPT’s responses. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Background: Reducing lifestyle risk behaviors among adolescents depends on access to age-appropriate health promotion information. Chatbots—computer programs designed to simulate conversations with human users—have the potential to deliver health information to adolescents to improve their lifestyle behaviors and support behavior change, but research on the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in the adolescent population is unknown. Objective: This systematic scoping review aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions among adolescents. A secondary aim is to consult adolescents to identify features of chatbots that are acceptable and feasible. Methods: We searched 6 electronic databases from March to April 2022 (MEDLINE, Embase, Joanna Briggs Institute, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health, the Association for Computing Machinery library, and the IT database Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). Peer-reviewed studies were included that were conducted in the adolescent population (10-19 years old) without any chronic disease, except obesity or type 2 diabetes, and assessed chatbots used nutrition or physical activity interventions or both that encouraged individuals to meet dietary or physical activity guidelines and support positive behavior change. Studies were screened by 2 independent reviewers, with any queries resolved by a third reviewer. Data were extracted into tables and collated in a narrative summary. Gray literature searches were also undertaken. Results of the scoping review were presented to a diverse youth advisory group (N=16, 13-18 years old) to gain insights into this topic beyond what is published in the literature. Results: The search identified 5558 papers, with 5 (0.1%) studies describing 5 chatbots meeting the inclusion criteria. The 5 chatbots were supported by mobile apps using a combination of the following features: personalized feedback, conversational agents, gamification, and monitoring of behavior change. Of the 5 studies, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on nutrition, 2 (40.0%) studies focused on physical activity, and 1 (20.0%) focused on both nutrition and physical activity. Feasibility and acceptability varied across the 5 studies, with usage rates above 50% in 3 (60.0%) studies. In addition, 3 (60.0%) studies reported health-related outcomes, with only 1 (20.0%) study showing promising effects of the intervention. Adolescents presented novel concerns around the use of chatbots in nutrition and physical activity interventions, including ethical concerns and the use of false or misleading information. Conclusions: Limited research is available on chatbots in adolescent nutrition and physical activity interventions, finding insufficient evidence on the acceptability and feasibility of chatbots in the adolescent population. Similarly, adolescent consultation identified issues in the design features that have not been mentioned in the published literature. Therefore, chatbot codesign with adolescents may help ensure that such technology is feasible and acceptable to an adolescent population. ©Rui Han, Allyson Todd, Sara Wardak, Stephanie R Partridge, Rebecca Raeside.

AB  - Donating blood is a selfless act that impacts public welfare, potentially saving human lives. However, blood shortage is a rising worldwide issue due to increased demand. Thus, finding ways to animate and motivate potential donors to donate blood is paramount. In this context, conversational agents (CAs) offer a promising approach to educating, promoting, and achieving desired behaviors. In this paper, we conducted an online experimental study (N=303) and investigated the effect of a human-like designed CA and fear-inducing communication on users’ intention to donate. Our results show that users’ intention is driven by perceived persuasiveness rather than perceived humanness and that fear-inducing communication does not significantly affect the intention to donate. Against this background, we provide numerous theoretical and practical implications, contributing to information system literature by enhancing our understanding of how fear-inducing communication is used in CA interactions. © 2023 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: "Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Hu.

AB  - Objective: Varenicline is the most efficacious approved smoking cessation medication, making it one of the most cost-effective clinical interventions for reducing tobacco-related morbidity and mortality. Adhering to varenicline is strongly associated with smoking cessation. Healthbots have the potential to help people adhere to their medications by scaling up evidence-based behavioral interventions. In this protocol, we outline how we will follow the UK's Medical Research Council's guidance to codesign a theory-informed, evidence-based, and patient-centered healthbot to help people adhere to varenicline. Methods: The study will utilize the Discover, Design and Build, and Test framework and will include three phases: (a) a rapid review and interviews with 20 patients and 20 healthcare providers to understand barriers and facilitators to varenicline adherence (Discover phase); (b) Wizard of Oz test to design the healthbot and get a sense of the questions that chatbot has to be able to answer (Design phase); and (c) building, training, and beta-testing the healthbot (Building and Testing phases) where the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability framework will be used to develop the healthbot using the simplest sensible solution, and 20 participants will beta test the healthbot. We will use the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model of behavior change and its associated framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework, to organize the findings. Conclusions: The present approach will enable us to systematically identify the most appropriate features for the healthbot based on a well-established behavioral theory, the latest scientific evidence, and end users’ and healthcare providers’ knowledge. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - With the exponential growth in the number of wireless devices and wireless applications, and the emergence of various wireless technologies, the electromagnetic spectrum environment has presented complex characteristics such as multi-domain environments and situations, diverse applications, changeable behaviors, and dense signals. Spectrum resource control through immediate and effective analysis and processing of massive data is vital for efficient spectrum utilization and electromagnetic spectrum dominance. Intelligent technology represented by machine learning methods provides new opportunities to analyze electromagnetic spectrum data. Machine learning methods have been applied to wireless networks, spectrum management, resource management, and other scenarios. There are many challenges when applying machine learning to the electromagnetic spectrum environment. Because of the dynamically changing environment and tasks, the scarcity of high-quality labeled samples, real-time spectrum decision-making, and the difficulty of knowledge utilization and transfer in the electromagnetic spectrum environment, existing machine learning algorithms are not ideal for intelligent cognitive decision-making. Taking the research on interference recognition as an example, the traditional methods include two stages: signal feature extraction and pattern recognition. With the growth in computer computing power, deep learning techniques gradually replace traditional methods because of their powerful feature characterization capability. However, the electromagnetic spectrum environment and data often have uncertainties caused by unknown, dynamic changes. Adapting deep learning to unobserved tasks quickly is challenging, indicating poor generalization capability. Furthermore, it is limited by its reliance on a large number of high-quality labeled samples and manual adjustment of hyperparameters for offline training. Thus, although deep learning has far outperformed traditional methods in most research scenarios, traditional machine learning-based image recognition models still have advantages in some scenarios. In interference recognition, if traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms and their hyperparameters can be dynamically scheduled according to the environment and task characteristics, the shortcomings of using a single algorithm can be avoided, resulting in improved overall performance. It is necessary to propose a learning paradigm that continuously adapts to dynamic environments and tasks, accumulates new knowledge, is robust to erroneous sample data, and is partially interpretable. The leap from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence toward general artificial intelligence has research significance and practical value. Given the characteristics of the electromagnetic spectrum, this paper proposes a new paradigm of machine learning method in the electromagnetic spectrum environment—cognitive learning, attempting to use machine learning techniques at a“cognitive”level. It includes offline training, online execution, online feedback and offline self-learning processes, corresponding to the executive control and introspective processes of the brain's cognitive mechanisms. Offline training explores the matching relationship between the algorithm type and hyperparameters with the environment and the task. During the online process, it can perform decision-making based on the actual environment, select appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters, and output learning results. The feedback of learning results can be used for self-optimization in offline self-learning, forming an offline-online-offline structure. The cognitive feature extraction module establishes matching relationships between features of environments and tasks and algorithm types and hyperparameters to obtain the appropriate algorithm types and hyperparameters. The memory module calls specific algorithms and hyperparameter values for algorithm reconstruction. The learning network module executes the selected algorithm based on the input data and outputs online learning results. The cognitive evaluation module introspects the online learning results and adjusts the data in the memory database and cognitive case base, and updates the most appropriate algorithm and hyperparameters. In the offline stage, the current learning results are judged whether to be stored as a new cognitive case in the memory. The cognitive control module retrains the selection of algorithms and hyperparameters to continuously optimize the performance of selecting algorithms and hyperparameters. Moreover, we reveal and confirm the dynamic matching theorem and the optimal matching theorem in cognitive learning according to the No Free Lunch Theorem. The dynamic matching theorem states the existence and dynamics of optimal algorithms and hyperparameters. For any environment or task, there is always a set of algorithms and hyperparameters with optimal performance, which differs for different environments and tasks. The proposed cognitive learning paradigm can select appropriate algorithms and hyperparameters. The optimal matching theorem states that as the knowledge of algorithm and hyperparameter selection increases, the search space of candidate algorithm types and hyperparameters decreases, and the probability of selecting the most suitable algorithm type and hyperparameters increases. A cognitive learning scheme for radio frequency interference identification is designed. Different algorithms and hyperparameters are adopted for different problems to generate test results and a cognitive case base based on the differential task requirements and signal modalities acquired by cognitive feature extraction. A large number of cognitive cases are used as training samples to train the neural network for algorithm and hyperparameter selection. A radial basis function neural network is used for the neural network structure, which has the advantage that the number of hidden units does not need to be set manually. The size of hidden layers can be automatically expanded according to the approximate linear correlation criterion when the number of training samples for various problem features increases, alleviating the problem of catastrophic forgetting in neural networks. We performed interference recognition simulations with different datasets and different recognition requirements. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed paradigm can adapt to dynamically changing environments and tasks, improve performance by self-learning, and alleviate the impact of mislabeled samples. The cognitive learning paradigm has a pioneering significance for developing machine learning methods applied to the electromagnetic spectrum environment. There remains room for improvement in cognitive learning. We must seek future research breakthroughs in multimodal computing, knowledge interpretability, large-scale tasks, and learning architecture scalability. © 2023 Chinese Institute of Electronics.

AB  - In 2023, childhood hypoglycaemia remains a major public health problem and significant risk factor for consequent adverse neurodevelopment. Irrespective of the underlying cause, key elements of clinical management include the detection, prediction and prevention of episodes of hypoglycaemia. These tasks are increasingly served by Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) devices that measure subcutaneous glucose at near-continuous frequency. While the use of CGM in type 1 diabetes is well established, the evidence for widespread use in rare hypoglycaemia disorders is less than convincing. However, in the few years since our last review there have been multiple developments and increased user feedback, requiring a review of clinical application. Despite advances in device technology, point accuracy of CGM remains low for children with non-diabetes hypoglycaemia. Simple provision of CGM devices has not replicated the efficacy seen in those with diabetes and is yet to show benefit. Machine learning techniques for hypoglycaemia prevention have so far failed to demonstrate sufficient prediction accuracy for real world use even in those with diabetes. Furthermore, access to CGM globally is restricted by costs kept high by the commercially-driven speed of technical innovation. Nonetheless, the ability of CGM to digitally phenotype disease groups has led to a better understanding of natural history of disease, facilitated diagnoses and informed changes in clinical management. Large CGM datasets have prompted re-evaluation of hypoglycaemia incidence and facilitated improved trial design. Importantly, an individualised approach and focus on the behavioural determinants of hypoglycaemia has led to real world reduction in hypoglycaemia. In this state of the art review, we critically analyse the updated evidence for use of CGM in non-diabetic childhood hypoglycaemia disorders since 2020 and provide suggestions for qualified use.

AB  - Argumentation is ubiquitous in everyday discourse, and it is a skill that can be learned. In our society, it is also one that must be learned: education systems all over the world agree on the importance of argumentation skills. However, writing effective argumentation is difficult, and even more so if it has to be expressed in a foreign language. Existing artificial intelligence systems for language learning can help learners: they can provide objective feedback (e.g., concerning grammar and spelling), as well as providing learners with opportunities to identify errors and subsequently improve their texts. Even so, systems aiming at higher discourse-level skills, such as persuasiveness and content organisation, are still limited. In this article, we propose the novel task of sentence reordering for improving the logical flow of argumentative essays. To train such a computational system, we present a new corpus called ICNALE-AS2R, containing essays written by English-as-foreign-language learners from various Asian countries, that have been annotated with argumentative structure and sentence reordering. We also propose a novel method to automatically reorder sentences in imperfect essays, which is based on argumentative structure analysis. Given an input essay and its corresponding argumentative structure, we cast the reordering task as a traversal problem. Our sentence reordering system first determines the pairwise ordering relation between pairs of sentences that are connected by argumentative relations. In the second step, the system traverses the argumentative structure that has been augmented with pairwise ordering information, in order to generate the final output text. Empirical evaluation shows that in the task of reconstructing the final reordered essays in the dataset, our reordering system achieves .926 and .879 in longest common subsequence ratio and Kendall's Tau metrics, respectively. The system is also able to perform the reordering operation selectively, that is, it reorders sentences when necessary and retains the original input order when it is already optimal. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Smartphone weight loss apps are constantly being developed but the essential elements needed by a multi-ethnic population with overweight and obesity remains unclear. Purpose: To explore the perceptions of an Asian multi-ethnic population with overweight and obesity on the essential elements of weight loss apps. Twenty two participants were purposively sampled from a specialist weight management clinic in Singapore from 13 April to 30 April 2021. Recorded interviews were conducted using face-to-face and videoconferencing modalities. Data saturation was reached at the 18th participant. Data analysis was performed using inductive content analysis with constant comparison between and within transcripts. Findings: Three themes and eight subthemes on the essential app components emerged—(a) comprehensive and flexible calorie counters; (b) holistic, gradual and individualized behavior change recommendations tailored for people with overweight and obesity, and (c) just-in-time reminders of future consequences. There was a need to incorporate flexible options for food logging; break down general recommendations into small steps towards sustainable changes; tailor app contents for people with overweight and obesity; and evoke one’s considerations of future consequences. Future weight loss apps should be designed to meet the needs of those with overweight and obesity, the very population that needs assistance with weight loss. Future apps could consider leveraging the capacity of artificial intelligence to provide personalized weight management in terms of sustaining self-regulation behaviors, optimizing goal-setting and providing personalized and timely recommendations for weight loss. © Society of Behavioral Medicine 2023.

AB  - Indian Red Scorpion (Mesobuthus tamulus) stings are a neglected public health problem in tropical and sub-tropical countries, including India. The drawbacks of conventional therapies using commercial anti-scorpion antivenom (ASA) and α1-adrenoreceptor antagonists (AAA) have prompted us to search for an adequate formulation to improve treatment against M. tamulus stings. Novel therapeutic drug formulations (TDF) of low doses of commercial ASA, AAA, and ascorbic acid have remarkably improved in neutralising the in vivo toxic effects of M. tamulus venom (MTV) tested in Caenorhabditis elegans and Wistar strain albino rats in vivo models. The neutralisation of MTV-induced production of free radicals, alteration of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, and upregulated expression of genes involved in apoptosis, detoxification, and stress response in C. elegans by TDF surpassed the same effect shown by individual components of the TDF. Further, TDF efficiently neutralized the MTV-induced increase in blood glucose level within 30 to 60 min post-treatment, organ tissue damage, necrosis, and pulmonary oedema in Wistar rats, indicating its clinical application for effecting treating M. tamulus envenomation. This study demonstrates for the first time that C. elegans can be a model organism for screening the neutralization potency of the drug molecules against a neurotoxic scorpion venom. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Personal autonomy is central to people's experiences of agency and abilities to actively take part in society. To address the challenges of supporting autonomy, we propose a functional model of autonomy, according to which the experience of agency is a function of the opportunity to determine what to do, when to act and how to act in goal-pursuit. We tested the model in three experiments where the three goal-pursuit components could be constrained by another person or an artificial intelligence (AI) agent. Results showed that removing any of the three components from one's own decisions reduced experienced agency (Study 1a and 1b) and lowered motivation to pursue goals in organisational contexts (Study 2). In comparison to the strong and robust main effects, interactions between the components and the effects of the source of restriction (human vs. AI) were negligible.

AB  - OBJECTIVE We investigated the efficacy of an integrated digital health care platform with artificial intelligence (AI)–based dietary management in adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In this 48-week, open-label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial, overweight or obese adults with T2D were randomly assigned to one of three groups in a 1:1:1 ratio: group A received routine diabetes care; group B used the digital integrated health care platform by themselves; and group C used the platform with feedback from medical staff and intermittently applied personal continuous glucose monitoring. The primary end point was the difference of change in HbA1c from baseline to 24 weeks between groups A and B, while secondary end points included changes in HbA1c from baseline to 48 weeks and changes in body weight during follow-up. RESULTS A total of 294 participants were randomly assigned to group A (n = 99), B (n = 97), or C (n = 98). The decreases in HbA1c from baseline to 24 and 48 weeks in group B (20.32 ± 0.58% to 24 weeks and 20.28 ± 0.56% to 48 weeks) and group C (20.49 ± 0.57% to 24 weeks and 20.44 ± 0.62% to 48 weeks) were significantly larger than those in group A (20.06 ± 0.61% to 24 weeks and 0.07 ± 0.78% to 48 weeks). Groups B and C exhibited greater weight loss than group A from baseline to 24 weeks, and group C demonstrated more weight loss than group A from baseline to week 48. CONCLUSIONS Among adults with T2D, use of an integrated digital health care platform with AIdriven dietary management resulted in better glycemia and more weight loss. © 2023 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - With the wide availability of large language models and generative AI, there are four primary paradigms for human–AI collaboration: human-only, AI-only (ChatGPT-4), augmented human (where a human makes the final decision with AI output as a reference), or augmented AI (where the AI makes the final decision with human output as a reference). In partnership with one of the world’s leading consulting firms, we enlisted professional content creators and ChatGPT-4 to create advertising content for products and persuasive content for campaigns following the aforementioned paradigms. First, we find that, contrary to the expectations of some of the existing algorithm aversion literature on conventional predictive AI, the content generated by generative AI and augmented AI is perceived as of higher quality than that produced by human experts and augmented human experts. Second, revealing the source of content production reduces—but does not reverse—the perceived quality gap between human-and AI-generated content. This bias in evaluation is predominantly driven by human favoritism rather than AI aversion: Knowing that the same content is created by a human expert increases its (reported) perceived quality, but knowing that AI is involved in the creation process does not affect its perceived quality. Further analysis suggests this bias is not due to a ‘quality prime’ as knowing the content they are about to evaluate comes from competent creators (e.g., industry professionals and state-of-the-art AI) without knowing exactly that the creator of each piece of content does not increase participants’ perceived quality. © The Author(s), 2023.

AB  - Background: Chatbots have become ubiquitous in our daily lives, enabling natural language conversations with users through various modes of communication. Chatbots have the potential to play a significant role in promoting health and well-being. As the number of studies and available products related to chatbots continues to rise, there is a critical need to assess product features to enhance the design of chatbots that effectively promote health and behavioral change. Objective: This scoping review aims to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state of health-related chatbots, including the chatbots' characteristics and features, user backgrounds, communication models, relational building capacity, personalization, interaction, responses to suicidal thoughts, and users' in-app experiences during chatbot use. Through this analysis, we seek to identify gaps in the current research, guide future directions, and enhance the design of health-focused chatbots. Methods: Following the scoping review methodology by Arksey and O'Malley and guided by the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist, this study used a two-pronged approach to identify relevant chatbots: (1) searching the iOS and Android App Stores and (2) reviewing scientific literature through a search strategy designed by a librarian. Overall, 36 chatbots were selected based on predefined criteria from both sources. These chatbots were systematically evaluated using a comprehensive framework developed for this study, including chatbot characteristics, user backgrounds, building relational capacity, personalization, interaction models, responses to critical situations, and user experiences. Ten coauthors were responsible for downloading and testing the chatbots, coding their features, and evaluating their performance in simulated conversations. The testing of all chatbot apps was limited to their free-to-use features. Results: This review provides an overview of the diversity of health-related chatbots, encompassing categories such as mental health support, physical activity promotion, and behavior change interventions. Chatbots use text, animations, speech, images, and emojis for communication. The findings highlight variations in conversational capabilities, including empathy, humor, and personalization. Notably, concerns regarding safety, particularly in addressing suicidal thoughts, were evident. Approximately 44% (16/36) of the chatbots effectively addressed suicidal thoughts. User experiences and behavioral outcomes demonstrated the potential of chatbots in health interventions, but evidence remains limited. Conclusions: This scoping review underscores the significance of chatbots in health-related applications and offers insights into their features, functionalities, and user experiences. This study contributes to advancing the understanding of chatbots' role in digital health interventions, thus paving the way for more effective and user-centric health promotion strategies. This study informs future research directions, emphasizing the need for rigorous randomized control trials, standardized evaluation metrics, and user-centered design to unlock the full potential of chatbots in enhancing health and well-being. Future research should focus on addressing limitations, exploring real-world user experiences, and implementing robust data security and privacy measures. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Objective: Trust determines the success of Health-Behavior-Change Artificial Intelligence Apps (HBC-AIApp). Developers of such apps need theory-based practical methods that can guide them in achieving such trust. Our study aimed to develop a comprehensive conceptual model and development process that can guide developers how to build HBC-AIApp in order to support trust creation among the app's users. Methods: We apply a multi-disciplinary approach where medical informatics, human-centered design, and holistic health methods are integrated to address the trust challenge in HBC-AIApps. The integration extends a conceptual model of trust in AI developed by Jermutus et al., whose properties guide the extension of the IDEAS (integrate, design, assess, and share) HBC-App development process. Results: The HBC-AIApp framework consists of three main blocks: (1) system development methods that study the users' complex reality, hence, their perceptions, needs, goals and environment; (2) mediators and other stakeholders who are important for developing and operating the HBC-AIApp, boundary objects that examine users' activities via the HBC-AIApp; and (3) the HBC-AIApp's structural components, AI logic, and physical implementation. These blocks come together to provide the extended conceptual model of trust in HBC-AIApps and the extended IDEAS process. Discussion: The developed HBC-AIApp framework drew from our own experience in developing trust in HBC-AIApp. Further research will focus on studying the application of the proposed comprehensive HBC-AIApp development framework and whether applying it supports trust creation in such apps. © 2023

AB  - Large language models (LLMs) are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without training data). If zero-shot LLMs can also reliably classify and explain social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could augment the computational social science (CSS) pipeline in important ways. This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 25 representative English CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers’ gold references. We conclude that the performance of today’s LLMs can augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the underlying attributes of a text). In summary, LLMs are posed to meaningfully participate in social science analysis in partnership with humans. © 2024 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a transformative force in communication and messaging strategy, with potential to disrupt traditional approaches. Large language models (LLMs), a form of AI, are capable of generating high-quality, humanlike text. We investigate the persuasive quality of AI-generated messages to understand how AI could impact public health messaging. Specifically, through a series of studies designed to characterize and evaluate generative AI in developing public health messages, we analyze COVID-19 pro-vaccination messages generated by GPT-3, a state-of-the-art instantiation of a large language model. Study 1 is a systematic evaluation of GPT-3's ability to generate pro-vaccination messages. Study 2 then observed peoples' perceptions of curated GPT-3-generated messages compared to human-authored messages released by the CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), finding that GPT-3 messages were perceived as more effective, stronger arguments, and evoked more positive attitudes than CDC messages. Finally, Study 3 assessed the role of source labels on perceived quality, finding that while participants preferred AI-generated messages, they expressed dispreference for messages that were labeled as AI-generated. The results suggest that, with human supervision, AI can be used to create effective public health messages, but that individuals prefer their public health messages to come from human institutions rather than AI sources. We propose best practices for assessing generative outputs of large language models in future social science research and ways health professionals can use AI systems to augment public health messaging.  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Natural language processing—the branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the interaction between computers and human language—has advanced markedly in recent years with the introduction of sophisticated deep-learning models. Improved performance in natural language processing tasks, such as text and speech processing, have fueled impressive demonstrations of these models’ capabilities. Perhaps no demonstration has been more impactful to date than the introduction of the publicly available online chatbot ChatGPT in November 2022 by OpenAI, which is based on a natural language processing model known as a Generative Pretrained Transformer. Through a series of questions posed by the authors about obstetrics and gynecology to ChatGPT as prompts, we evaluated the model's ability to handle clinical-related queries. Its answers demonstrated that in its current form, ChatGPT can be valuable for users who want preliminary information about virtually any topic in the field. Because its educational role is still being defined, we must recognize its limitations. Although answers were generally eloquent, informed, and lacked a significant degree of mistakes or misinformation, we also observed evidence of its weaknesses. A significant drawback is that the data on which the model has been trained are apparently not readily updated. The specific model that was assessed here, seems to not reliably (if at all) source data from after 2021. Users of ChatGPT who expect data to be more up to date need to be aware of this drawback. An inability to cite sources or to truly understand what the user is asking suggests that it has the capability to mislead. Responsible use of models like ChatGPT will be important for ensuring that they work to help but not harm users seeking information on obstetrics and gynecology. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to understand a customer-purchase mechanism in the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered chatbot context based on the elaboration likelihood model (ELM) and technology acceptance model (TAM). The first objective is to examine how to boost chatbot adoption. The second objective is to investigate the role of information characteristics, technology-related characteristics and attitude toward AI in purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach: Data was collected from a sample of 492 users in Vietnam, who are potential customers of chatbots for purchase. Structural equation modeling was applied for data analysis. Findings: Results illustrate that chatbot adoption is significantly influenced by information credibility, technology-related factors (i.e. interactivity, relative advantage and perceived intelligence), attitude toward AI and perceived usefulness. Moreover, information quality and persuasiveness motivate information credibility. Information credibility and attitude toward AI are the essential motivations for perceived usefulness. Finally, chatbot adoption and information credibility determine purchase intention. Practical implications: The results are insightful for practitioners to envisage the importance of chatbot use for customer purchase in the AI scenario. Additionally, this research offers a framework to practitioners for shaping customer engagement in chatbots. Originality/value: The value of this work lies in the incorporation of technology-related characteristics into the two well-established theories, the ELM and TAM, to identify the importance of AI and its applications (i.e. chatbots) for purchase and to understand the formation of perceived usefulness and chatbot use through information credibility and attitude toward AI. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: In recent years, there has been a rise in the use of conversational agents for lifestyle medicine, in particular for weight-related behaviors and cardiometabolic risk factors. Little is known about the effectiveness and acceptability of and engagement with conversational and virtual agents as well as the applicability of these agents for metabolic syndrome risk factors such as an unhealthy dietary intake, physical inactivity, diabetes, and hypertension. Objective: This review aimed to get a greater understanding of the virtual agents that have been developed for cardiometabolic risk factors and to review their effectiveness. Methods: A systematic review of PubMed and MEDLINE was conducted to review conversational agents for cardiometabolic risk factors, including chatbots and embodied avatars. Results: A total of 50 studies were identified. Overall, chatbots and avatars appear to have the potential to improve weight-related behaviors such as dietary intake and physical activity. There were limited studies on hypertension and diabetes. Patients seemed interested in using chatbots and avatars for modifying cardiometabolic risk factors, and adherence was acceptable across the studies, except for studies of virtual agents for diabetes. However, there is a need for randomized controlled trials to confirm this finding. As there were only a few clinical trials, more research is needed to confirm whether conversational coaches may assist with cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and physical activity. ©Lynnette Nathalie Lyzwinski, Mohamed Elgendi, Carlo Menon.

AB  - Nature parks are one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. Still, they are sometimes abandoned with little use despite their elegant landscapes, or they can be damaged by the influx of people who come for localized and temporary promotions, so it is necessary to ensure that a certain number of tourists continue to visit in a dispersed manner. While theme parks that charge admission fees may control the number of tourists by setting dynamic prices, this approach is not suitable for nature parks that are free of charge. Some nature parks collect donations, but this is not directly aimed at controlling the number of tourists. Therefore, we propose a system to boost and control the number of tourists by providing information to lure tourists to the best spots scattered throughout the vast nature park and offering unique amusement in return for their donations. We developed a smartphone application that amuses response to tourists' donations. In addition, we provided a tourist guide reflecting the status of sightseeing spots in real-time, and 89.6% of the subjects positively evaluated the guide. Furthermore, we observed that having the AI suggest ideas for making sightseeing spots more attractive had the effect of imagining the actions tourists would want to take at those spots. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: In parallel with the aging population, it will be necessary to provide health care to an increasing number of dementia patients in the coming years. It is critical to develop a gerontology education perspective and change it in accordance with the possibilities of the age. The simulation-based learning method provides an opportunity for experiential learning in education. There is quite a few data on how dementia simulation education improves attitudes toward dementia. We examined how a simulation education program changed students’ attitudes toward communication, empathy, and dementia with individuals with dementia. Methods: This quantitative study investigated undergraduate students’ change in awareness of dementia before and after participating in the educational intervention. This study employed a one-group repeated-measures design. A non-virtual, applied dementia simulation program consisting of eight stations was studied with gerontology third and fourth years 116 students. The data were collected by applying the Personal Information form, Dementia Attitude scale (DAS), Empathy Quotient scale (EQS), and The Evaluation Scale of Education Program (ESEP). Results: DAS and EQS scores were significantly higher after the theorical (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000) and practical education (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000) than before the theorical (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000) and practical education. DAS, EQS, and ESEP scores significantly higher after practical education than after the theorical one (pDAS=0.000; pEQS=0.000; pESEP=0.000). Conclusion: Results; points out that dementia simulation helps students understand the experiences of people living with dementia, develop empathetic attitudes, and that dementia simulation education complements and improves traditional teaching methods. Based on these findings, we recommend an applied learning process that includes dementia simulation in addition to classical methods in gerontology education. © Copyright 2023 by Medical Journal of Bakırköy published by Galenos Yayınevi.

AB  - Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) can increase user engagement and involvement and can strengthen the effect of an intervention on health outcomes that is provided via an ECA. However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of ECAs on health outcomes is still limited. In this article, we report on a study that has the goal to identify the effect of a match between a health topic and the ECAs’ appearance on ratings of personality characteristics, persuasiveness and intention to use. We report on an online experiment with three different ECAs and three different health topics, conducted among 732 older adults. We triangulated the quantitative results with qualitative insights from a focus group. The results reveal that older adults prefer an ECA that has an appearance matching a certain health topic, resulting in higher ratings on persuasiveness and intention to use. Personality characteristics should be measured embedded within a health topic, but are not rated higher because of a match. We furthermore provide guidelines for designing the content of the ECA. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in natural language processing tasks. In this paper, we explore the application of LLMs within a business context. Specifically, we employ LLMs to devise a sales strategy geared towards maximizing customer values (benefits and satisfaction). This sales plan encompasses five iterative stages: market landscape survey, customer profiling, product usage analysis, sales strategy formulation, and crafting persuasive pitches and materials. We leverage LLMs to supplement the limited data available to the company, aiming to enhance the efficacy of each stage and optimize KPIs, including the value-oriented sales conversion and profitability. Due to confidentiality and trade secret concerns, we blend artificial data with genuine data to ensure customer anonymity and protect sales playbooks. Despite these precautions, we effectively demonstrate our methodology of harnessing LLMs to refine the sales planning procedure. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Multimedia content, such as advertisements and story videos, exhibit a rich blend of creativity and multiple modalities. They incorporate elements like text, visuals, audio, and storytelling techniques, employing devices like emotions, symbolism, and slogans to convey meaning. There is a dearth of large annotated training datasets in the multimedia domain hindering the development of supervised learning models with satisfactory performance for real-world applications. On the other hand, the rise of large language models (LLMs) has witnessed remarkable zero-shot performance in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as emotion classification, question-answering, and topic classification. To leverage such advanced techniques to bridge this performance gap in multimedia understanding, we propose verbalizing long videos to generate their descriptions in natural language, followed by performing video-understanding tasks on the generated story as opposed to the original video. Through extensive experiments on fifteen video-understanding tasks, we demonstrate that our method, despite being zero-shot, achieves significantly better results than supervised baselines for video understanding. Furthermore, to alleviate a lack of story understanding benchmarks, we publicly release the first dataset on a crucial task in computational social science on persuasion strategy identification. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - The increasing need for organ donations remains a worldwide challenge as transplant waiting lists grow and donation rates persist at constant levels. The increasing popularity of conversational agents (CAs) has prompted new strategies for educating and persuading individuals to adjust their cognitive and behavioral beliefs and become donors. However, how CAs should be designed to modify uninformed users’ intention to donate remains unclear. Against this background, we conducted an online experiment (N=134) to examine the impact of a human-like CA design on users' intention to become organ donors. Based on the three-factor theory of anthropomorphism and the elaboration likelihood model, we derive three theoretical mechanisms to understand the influence of a CAs human-like design on users’ intention to donate. The findings show that perceived anthropomorphism does not directly impact persuasion and empathy but is mediated via perceived usefulness to influence the intention to donate. © 2023 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: "Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Hu.

AB  - Argument(ation) mining (AM) is an area of research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) that aims to identify, analyse and automatically generate arguments in natural language. In a pipeline, the identification and analysis of the arguments and their components (i.e. premises and claims) in texts and the prediction of their relations (i.e. attack and support) are then handled by argument-based reasoning frameworks so that, for example, fallacies and inconsistencies can be automatically identified. Recently, the field of argument mining has tackled new challenges, namely the evaluation of argument quality (e.g. strength, persuasiveness), natural language argument summarisation and retrieval, and natural language argument generation. In this paper, I discuss my main contributions in this area as well as some lines of future research. Copyright © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Deception and persuasion play a critical role in long-horizon dialogues between multiple parties, especially when the interests, goals, and motivations of the participants are not aligned. Such complex tasks pose challenges for current Large Language Models (LLM) as deception and persuasion can easily mislead them, especially in long-horizon multi-party dialogues. To this end, we explore the game of Avalon: The Resistance, a social deduction game in which players must determine each other's hidden identities to complete their team's objective. We introduce an online testbed and a dataset containing 20 carefully collected and labeled games among human players that exhibit long-horizon deception in a cooperative-competitive setting. We discuss the capabilities of LLMs to utilize deceptive long-horizon conversations between six human players to determine each player's goal and motivation. Particularly, we discuss the multimodal integration of the chat between the players and the game's state that grounds the conversation, providing further insights into the true player identities. We find that even current state-of-the-art LLMs do not reach human performance, making our dataset a compelling benchmark to investigate the decision-making and language-processing capabilities of LLMs. Our dataset and online testbed can be found at our project website: https://sstepput.github.io/Avalon-NLU/. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Background: Since the mid-2010s, use of conversational artificial intelligence (AI; chatbots) in health care has expanded significantly, especially in the context of increased burdens on health systems and restrictions on in-person consultations with health care providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. One emerging use for conversational AI is to capture evolving questions and communicate information about vaccines and vaccination. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to examine documented uses and evidence on the effectiveness of conversational AI for vaccine communication. Methods: This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, Embase, Epistemonikos, Global Health, Global Index Medicus, Academic Search Complete, and the University of London library database were searched for papers on the use of conversational AI for vaccine communication. The inclusion criteria were studies that included (1) documented instances of conversational AI being used for the purpose of vaccine communication and (2) evaluation data on the impact and effectiveness of the intervention. Results: After duplicates were removed, the review identified 496 unique records, which were then screened by title and abstract, of which 38 were identified for full-text review. Seven fit the inclusion criteria and were assessed and summarized in the findings of this review. Overall, vaccine chatbots deployed to date have been relatively simple in their design and have mainly been used to provide factual information to users in response to their questions about vaccines. Additionally, chatbots have been used for vaccination scheduling, appointment reminders, debunking misinformation, and, in some cases, for vaccine counseling and persuasion. Available evidence suggests that chatbots can have a positive effect on vaccine attitudes; however, studies were typically exploratory in nature, and some lacked a control group or had very small sample sizes. Conclusions: The review found evidence of potential benefits from conversational AI for vaccine communication. Factors that may contribute to the effectiveness of vaccine chatbots include their ability to provide credible and personalized information in real time, the familiarity and accessibility of the chatbot platform, and the extent to which interactions with the chatbot feel “natural” to users. However, evaluations have focused on the short-term, direct effects of chatbots on their users. The potential longer-term and societal impacts of conversational AI have yet to be analyzed. In addition, existing studies do not adequately address how ethics apply in the field of conversational AI around vaccines. In a context where further digitalization of vaccine communication can be anticipated, additional high-quality research will be required across all these areas. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Chatbots have been used to achieve persuasive goals in various communication contexts. This research investigates how chatbot anthropomorphism intersects with emotional appeals to influence persuasive outcomes in science communication by conducting two experiments in the contexts of skin cancer prevention and biodiversity conservation. The findings showed a matching effect between emotional appeals and anthropomorphic cues: For a chatbot with more anthropomorphic cues, fear appeals were more persuasive than hope appeals; in contrast, for a less anthropomorphic chatbot, hope appeals were more effective. A key psychological mechanism underlying the relationships was personal risk perceptions but only for fear appeals. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Considering development assurance, predictability, explainability and robustness, the lack of trustworthiness has been identified as the key challenge when it comes to the certification of adaptive flight automation systems. Such systems change their characteristics in response to changes in the mission, environment, threats, or failures, which disallows certification according to the currently applicable set of regulations that stipulate a strictly deterministic behaviour. Automation systems are supposed to maintain the status that has been certified. They are not allowed to evolve, to learn from experience, because the risks associated with a changing behaviour are unforeseeable.Rule-based, certifiable software is developed according to well-established processes and software assurance. A thorough requirements engineering results in a set of software requirements, which will be, after deployment, traced back and verified according to the specification. Learning-based systems, in contrast, learn from training data. Herewith, the challenge shifts to the production of such training data and the subsequent training. On the one hand, training data has to meet the required level of integrity. Incomplete, wrong, ambiguous, noised, or biased training data may lead to undesired behaviour. On the other hand, training data should be available in sufficient quantity for training, validation, and testing of the system in question.An anthropomorphic approach could significantly contribute to the production of training data and the training itself, given the availability - and the validity - of all the training exercises and check standards for manned aviation. Once in a machine-interpretable form, these well-established and proven exercises could be modified automatically with adaptions of the environmental conditions (weather, other traffic,...), with unexpected occurrences of system failures, or could be re-created from a base set of building blocks. The training of a future adaptive flight automation system could profit from a great availability, integrity, and diversity of data. During the training, an electronic flight instructor could demonstrate the accomplishment of such training scenarios, allowing the system to learn from example. Then, an electronic flight examiner could check whether a flight automation system satisfactorily completes the given exercise, based on check standards from manned aviation. Even after deployment, the monitoring could continue, flagging any decrease in the desired performance and disclosing adverse learning effects.Training syllabi and simulator session rundowns delineate what the assigned flight instructor is supposed to do during the training. Many syllabi are available for basic flight training, type rating training, line-oriented flight training, low-visibility training, upset prevention and recovery training, training for airports with special approach procedures and much more. Check standards are formulated, framing the allowable tolerances during a flight check.This paper copes with the challenge of compiling these syllabi and standards into an unambiguous form that can be used to automate flight training. It first introduces a classification scheme for flight training exercises, dividing them into the classes of deterministic and non-deterministic exercises, supporting the different training phases. Secondly, the general flying tasks of a pilot are categorized into prime flying tasks, indivisible tasks that are combinable in order to meet the standards in all phases of an exercise. Finally, based on these two ingredients, a formal language is proposed, interpretable by a computer system, by an electronic flight instructor / flight examiner, to particularize flight training scenarios - with a concrete example of a basic training exercise, the standard traffic pattern. This will eventually support the establishment of such an anthropomorphic approach, allowing us to train and check future adaptive flight automation systems in a traceable, proven, and extensible framework nowadays already in use for human pilots. Until then, the proposed automated flight training can be validated and refined with human pilot aspirants and human flight instructors.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper aims to uncover state-of-the-art on persuasion through a dialogue system between human and virtual agents. 37 participants interacted with six virtual agents in different conditions of facial expressions and camera angles. Through empirical measurements using the Big Five theory, we discover that virtual agents' friendliness becomes a solid persuading factor to our predominantly extroverted participants. The experiment deduces that openness, conscientiousness, and extraversion personalities are easily persuaded by our virtual agents, unlike reversed-conscientiousness and neuroticism personalities. © The 2023 International Conference on Artificial Life and Robotics (ICAROB2023), Feb. 9 to 12, on line, Oita, Japan.

AB  - Background: Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States. Despite the availability of a plethora of evidence-based smoking cessation resources, less than one-third of individuals who smoke seek cessation services, and individuals using these services are often those who are actively contemplating quitting smoking. There is a distinct dearth of low-cost, scalable interventions to support smokers not ready to quit (ambivalent smokers). Such interventions can assist in gradually promoting smoking behavior changes in this target population until motivation to quit arises, at which time they can be navigated to existing evidence-based smoking cessation interventions. Conversational agents or chatbots could provide cessation education and support to ambivalent smokers to build motivation and navigate them to evidence-based resources when ready to quit. Objective: The goal of our study is to test the proof-of-concept of the development and preliminary feasibility and acceptability of a smoking cessation support chatbot. Methods: We will accomplish our study aims in 2 phases. In phase 1, we will survey 300 ambivalent smokers to determine their preferences and priorities for a smoking cessation support chatbot. A “forced-choice experiment” will be administered to understand participants’ preferred characteristics (attributes) of the proposed chatbot prototype. The data gathered will be used to program the prototype. In phase 2, we will invite 25 individuals who smoke to use the developed prototype. For this phase, participants will receive an overview of the chatbot and be encouraged to use the chatbot and engage and interact with the programmed attributes and components for a 2-week period. Results: At the end of phase 1, we anticipate identifying key attributes that ambivalent smokers prefer in a smoking cessation support chatbot. At the end of phase 2, chatbot acceptability and feasibility will be assessed. The study was funded in June 2022, and data collection for both phases of the study is currently ongoing. We expect study results to be published by December 2023. Conclusions: Study results will yield a smoking behavior change chatbot prototype developed for ambivalent smokers that will be ready for efficacy testing in a larger study. © Uma S Nair, Karah Greene, Stephanie Marhefka, Kristin Kosyluk, Jerome T Galea.

AB  - Modern marketing strategies that leverage technology to of-fer significant value for the client have replaced conventional selling techniques in recent years. A conversational agent or dialogue system presents an interactive computing product as a means of influencing people’s opinions. However, this expanding topic still had limits in the earlier study. To advance this field, the current experimental study incorporates new elements that are re-quired to enhance the ability to persuade and build a compelling case for product advertising. Research in the past has shown that emotional branding is essential to strengthen the customer’s engagement. Therefore, in this study, we created six contents, conducted an experiment with Japanese participants, and analyzed how to persuade them with emotional and cultural content using a sinking boat joke. A sinking boat joke is a joke about convincing people to jump into the water when a boat is ready to sink, which incorporates a cultural context. The experiment was conducted by recruiting Japanese students at a Japanese university. Contents were presented in a counterbalanced way. The goal is to ascertain which emotion works best for advertising, to investigate cultural differences, and to analyze the content effectiveness that successfully persuades the Japanese participants. © 2022 The Author.

AB  - In the area of captology, computers as persuasive technology, conversational agent or dialogue system represent an interactive computing product as a key to changing people’s viewpoints. Our former original experimental research addressed that a virtual agent’s positive facial expressions and near-distance camera angle successfully influence participants’ thoughts during an experiment. However, fragmentation in this growing topic led to theoretical confusion. To move the field forward, this paper uncovers the evidence-based elements as the standard compliance for designing the persuasive conversational agent. First, the fundamental premises, implications, constructs, and indicators from our previous original research were generated. Second, a theory synthesis from related articles on the interaction between virtual agents to humans, with the aim of persuading, was analyzed. Thus, it derives twelve fundamental premises, two implications, three main constructs, and fifteen indicators. Third, a model elaborates on the relationships between these constructs and indicators was developed. Its foundation is based on the three related concepts of the Persuasion Knowledge Model, Stimulus-Organism-Response Theory, Fogg’s Captology Framework, and one measurement model of Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling. Hence, the theory synthesis provides the basis for inventing the proposed conceptual model, called the Agent-Subject Persuasion Model (ASPM), which emphasizes the originality of this research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Fintech is a buzz word that is present everywhere with its integration of digitization, internet of things, blockchain technology, machine learning, Artificial intelligence tools. Financial industry transformed through innovative and advanced technological processes to offer a wide variety of financial products and services at an affordable cost for opportunity broadened decision making. An accelerated growth of Fintech industry, wide range of service providers, convenience of the users and changing attitude of the investors. A Global correlation analysis allows to explore the level of interaction among the assets or indices. A key contribution of this paper is the analysis of the growth of Fintech in terms of size, participants, users market growth, and the role of policy makers along the stakeholders. Another part is a conceptual model which indicates how fintech and financial inclusion contributes to the circular flow of economy and in turn to the sustainable development goals. Based on a quantile regression and wavelet coherence approach, results show a heterogenous nexus of Fintech industry with those of digital technologies and equity benchmarks, where timing plays an important role which nexus is better described as a fundamental linkage co-movement. Implications may arise for investors' preferences to seeking more for company stocks that implicitly contribute to financial inclusion and therefore to sustainable development.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Despite efforts, the UK death rate from asthma is the highest in Europe, and 65% of people with asthma in the United Kingdom do not receive the professional care they are entitled to. Experts have recommended the use of digital innovations to help address the issues of poor outcomes and lack of care access. An automated SMS text messaging–based conversational agent (ie, chatbot) created to provide access to asthma support in a familiar format via a mobile phone has the potential to help people with asthma across demographics and at scale. Such a chatbot could help improve the accuracy of self-assessed risk, improve asthma self-management, increase access to professional care, and ultimately reduce asthma attacks and emergencies. Objective: The aims of this study are to determine the feasibility and usability of a text-based conversational agent that processes a patient’s text responses and short sample voice recordings to calculate an estimate of their risk for an asthma exacerbation and then offers follow-up information for lowering risk and improving asthma control; assess the levels of engagement for different groups of users, particularly those who do not access professional services and those with poor asthma control; and assess the extent to which users of the chatbot perceive it as helpful for improving their understanding and self-management of their condition. Methods: We will recruit 300 adults through four channels for broad reach: Facebook, YouGov, Asthma + Lung UK social media, and the website Healthily (a health self-management app). Participants will be screened, and those who meet inclusion criteria (adults diagnosed with asthma and who use WhatsApp) will be provided with a link to access the conversational agent through WhatsApp on their mobile phones. Participants will be sent scheduled and randomly timed messages to invite them to engage in dialogue about their asthma risk during the period of study. After a data collection period (28 days), participants will respond to questionnaire items related to the quality of the interaction. A pre- and postquestionnaire will measure asthma control before and after the intervention. Results: This study was funded in March 2021 and started in January 2022. We developed a prototype conversational agent, which was iteratively improved with feedback from people with asthma, asthma nurses, and specialist doctors. Fortnightly reviews of iterations by the clinical team began in September 2022 and are ongoing. This feasibility study will start recruitment in January 2023. The anticipated completion of the study is July 2023. A future randomized controlled trial will depend on the outcomes of this study and funding. Conclusions: This feasibility study will inform a follow-up pilot and larger randomized controlled trial to assess the impact of a conversational agent on asthma outcomes, self-management, behavior change, and access to care. © Rafael A Calvo, Dorian Peters, Laura Moradbakhti, Darren Cook, Georgios Rizos, Bjoern Schuller, Constantinos Kallis, Ernie Wong, Jennifer Quint.

AB  - Voice-based phishing attacks, in which a scammer uses social engineering techniques over a phone call to convince victims to divulge sensitive information, cause losses of several million dollars. We present a pilot study of a novel intervention that trains users to recognize phishing calls by identifying the persuasion principles used by the scammer. The training is implemented via a Whatsapp chatbot that includes example audio recordings and exercises of scam calls, and how the scammer employs the principle of authority in order to persuade the victim. 50 students from a university participated in the persuasion principles training. We then conducted a simulated vishing call a few days later to test how well the participants recognize the call compared to a control group (also 50 students) that was only given a general awareness training, and was not specifically trained to recognize authority via chatbot exercises. We also conducted interviews with participants from both the groups to understand the perceived usefulness of the training. © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Background: Mental disorders cause substantial health-related burden worldwide. Mobile health interventions are increasingly being used to promote mental health and well-being, as they could improve access to treatment and reduce associated costs. Behavior change is an important feature of interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being. There is a need to discern the active components that can promote behavior change in such interventions and ultimately improve users’ mental health. Objective: This study systematically identified mental health conversational agents (CAs) currently available in app stores and assessed the behavior change techniques (BCTs) used. We further described their main features, technical aspects, and quality in terms of engagement, functionality, esthetics, and information using the Mobile Application Rating Scale. Methods: The search, selection, and assessment of apps were adapted from a systematic review methodology and included a search, 2 rounds of selection, and an evaluation following predefined criteria. We conducted a systematic app search of Apple’s App Store and Google Play using 42matters. Apps with CAs in English that uploaded or updated from January 2020 and provided interventions aimed at improving mental health and well-being and the assessment or management of mental disorders were tested by at least 2 reviewers. The BCT taxonomy v1, a comprehensive list of 93 BCTs, was used to identify the specific behavior change components in CAs. Results: We found 18 app-based mental health CAs. Most CAs had <1000 user ratings on both app stores (12/18, 67%) and targeted several conditions such as stress, anxiety, and depression (13/18, 72%). All CAs addressed >1 mental disorder. Most CAs (14/18, 78%) used cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Half (9/18, 50%) of the CAs identified were rule based (ie, only offered predetermined answers) and the other half (9/18, 50%) were artificial intelligence enhanced (ie, included open-ended questions). CAs used 48 different BCTs and included on average 15 (SD 8.77; range 4-30) BCTs. The most common BCTs were 3.3 “Social support (emotional),” 4.1 “Instructions for how to perform a behavior,” 11.2 “Reduce negative emotions,” and 6.1 “Demonstration of the behavior.” One-third (5/14, 36%) of the CAs claiming to be CBT based did not include core CBT concepts. Conclusions: Mental health CAs mostly targeted various mental health issues such as stress, anxiety, and depression, reflecting a broad intervention focus. The most common BCTs identified serve to promote the self-management of mental disorders with few therapeutic elements. CA developers should consider the quality of information, user confidentiality, access, and emergency management when designing mental health CAs. Future research should assess the role of artificial intelligence in promoting behavior change within CAs and determine the choice of BCTs in evidence-based psychotherapies to enable systematic, consistent, and transparent development and evaluation of effective digital mental health interventions. © Xiaowen Lin, Laura Martinengo, Ahmad Ishqi Jabir, Andy Hau Yan Ho, Josip Car, Rifat Atun, Lorainne Tudor Car.

AB  - The JITAI is an intervention design to support health behavior change. We designed a multi-level modeling framework for JITAIs and developed a proof-of-concept prototype (POC). This study aimed at investigating the usability of the POC by conducting two usability tests with students. We assessed the usability and the students’ workload and success in completing tasks. In the second usability test, however, they faced difficulties in completing the tasks. We will work on hiding the complexity of the framework as well as improving the frontend and the instructions. © 2023 The authors, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and IOS Press.

AB  - Modeling what makes an advertisement persuasive, i.e., eliciting the desired response from consumer, is critical to the study of propaganda, social psychology, and marketing. Despite its importance, computational modeling of persuasion in computer vision is still in its infancy, primarily due to the lack of benchmark datasets that can provide persuasion-strategy labels associated with ads. Motivated by persuasion literature in social psychology and marketing, we introduce an extensive vocabulary of persuasion strategies and build the first ad image corpus annotated with persuasion strategies. We then formulate the task of persuasion strategy prediction with multi-modal learning, where we design a multi-task attention fusion model that can leverage other ad-understanding tasks to predict persuasion strategies. The dataset also provides image segmentation masks, which labels persuasion strategies in the corresponding ad images on the test split. We publicly release our code and dataset at https://midas-research.github.io/persuasion-advertisements/. Copyright © 2023, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - This paper focuses on modeling mixed traffic flow that comprises human-driven vehicles (HV), adaptive cruise control (ACC) vehicles, and cooperative adaptive cruise control (CACC) vehicles in the off-ramp diverging area. The car-following behaviors of HVs, ACC vehicles, and CACC vehicles are modeled using an intelligent driver model (IDM), ACC car-following model, and CACC car-following model, respectively. The lane-changing behaviors of different types of vehicles in off-ramp diverging areas are modeled using the anticipatory lane change (ALC) model and the mandatory lane change (MLC) model. These models are important for describing the interaction among different types of vehicles in mixed traffic. The safety and efficiency of mixed traffic flow are analyzed by integrating the developed car-following models and lane-changing models in numerical simulation. A one-way, two-lane scenario is established for the simulation. The results reveal that when the proportion of CACC vehicles is about 0.6, the safety and general operating efficiency of mixed traffic flow in the off-ramp area deteriorate significantly. Increasing the conservative MLC zone length can improve the average speed of traffic flow. Guiding drivers in changing lanes is one way to improve the efficiency of traffic flow. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Epilepsy is a major disorder affecting millions of people. Although modern electrophysiological and imaging approaches provide high-resolution access to the multi-scale brain circuit malfunctions in epilepsy, our understanding of how behavior changes with epilepsy has remained rudimentary. As a result, screening for new therapies for children and adults with devastating epilepsies still relies on the inherently subjective, semi-quantitative assessment of a handful of pre-selected behavioral signs of epilepsy in animal models. Here, we use machine learning-assisted 3D video analysis to reveal hidden behavioral phenotypes in mice with acquired and genetic epilepsies and track their alterations during post-insult epileptogenesis and in response to anti-epileptic drugs. These results show the persistent reconfiguration of behavioral fingerprints in epilepsy and indicate that they can be employed for rapid, automated anti-epileptic drug testing at scale. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Virtual coaches have the potential to address the low adherence common to eHealth applications for behavior change by, for example, providing motivational support. However, given the multitude of factors affecting users’ attitudes toward virtual coaches, more insights are needed on how such virtual coaches can be designed to affect these attitudes in a specific use context positively. Especially valuable are insights that are based on users interacting with such a virtual coach for longer. We thus conducted a study in which more than 500 smokers interacted with the text-based virtual coach Sam in five sessions. In each session, Sam assigned smokers a new preparatory activity for quitting smoking and provided motivational support for doing the activity. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of users’ willingness to continue working and their relationship with Sam, we obtained eight themes for users’ attitudes toward Sam. These themes relate to whether Sam is seen as human or artificial, specific characteristics of Sam (e.g., caring character), the interaction with Sam, and the relationship with Sam. We used these themes to formulate literature-based recommendations to guide designers of virtual coaches for behavior change. For example, letting the virtual coach get to know users and disclose more information about itself may improve its relationship with users. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for decision-support tools to help cities become more resilient to infectious diseases. Through urban design and planning, non-pharmaceutical interventions can be enabled, impelling behaviour change and facilitating the construction of lower risk buildings and public spaces. Computational tools, including computer simulation, statistical models, and artificial intelligence, have been used to support responses to the current pandemic as well as to the spread of previous infectious diseases. Our multidisciplinary research group systematically reviewed state-of-the-art literature to propose a toolkit that employs computational modelling for various interventions and urban design processes. We selected 109 out of 8,737 studies retrieved from databases and analysed them based on the pathogen type, transmission mode and phase, design intervention and process, as well as modelling methodology (method, goal, motivation, focus, and indication to urban design). We also explored the relationship between infectious disease and urban design, as well as computational modelling support, including specific models and parameters. The proposed toolkit will help designers, planners, and computer modellers to select relevant approaches for evaluating design decisions depending on the target disease, geographic context, design stages, and spatial and temporal scales. The findings herein can be regarded as stand-alone tools, particularly for fighting against COVID-19, or be incorporated into broader frameworks to help cities become more resilient to future disasters. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to achieve persuasive operational transformations. Yet, agility is one of the prominent concepts in the organizational capability to gain competitive advantage in the global conditions that emerge with industry 4.0. However, a successful implementation of AI depends also on the ability to identify critical success factors (CSFs) that are important to be considered when implementing AI. While previous literature has already revealed CSFs that are important to be considered, this paper is the first of its kind that has used the M-TISM (Modified Total Interpretative Structural Modelling) methodology for the identification and prioritization of CSFs of AI in an agile industry 4.0 firm. With this background, this paper reveal 19 factors related to the technological, organizational and environmental dimensions. Then, the fuzzy MICMAC process is used to classify the CSFs based on driving and dependence power. © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Purpose: Prediction is a critical task in targeted online advertising, where predictions better than random guessing can translate to real economic return. This study aims to use machine learning (ML) methods to identify individuals who respond well to certain linguistic styles/persuasion techniques based on Aristotle’s means of persuasion, rhetorical devices, cognitive theories and Cialdini’s principles, given their psychometric profile. Design/methodology/approach: A total of 1,022 individuals took part in the survey; participants were asked to fill out the ten item personality measure questionnaire to capture personality traits and the dysfunctional attitude scale (DAS) to measure dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive vulnerabilities. ML classification models using participant profiling information as input were developed to predict the extent to which an individual was influenced by statements that contained different linguistic styles/persuasion techniques. Several ML algorithms were used including support vector machine, LightGBM and Auto-Sklearn to predict the effect of each technique given each individual’s profile (personality, belief system and demographic data). Findings: The findings highlight the importance of incorporating emotion-based variables as model input in predicting the influence of textual statements with embedded persuasion techniques. Across all investigated models, the influence effect could be predicted with an accuracy ranging 53%–70%, indicating the importance of testing multiple ML algorithms in the development of a persuasive communication (PC) system. The classification ability of models was highest when predicting the response to statements using rhetorical devices and flattery persuasion techniques. Contrastingly, techniques such as authority or social proof were less predictable. Adding DAS scale features improved model performance, suggesting they may be important in modelling persuasion. Research limitations/implications: In this study, the survey was limited to English-speaking countries and largely Western society values. More work is needed to ascertain the efficacy of models for other populations, cultures and languages. Most PC efforts are targeted at groups such as users, clients, shoppers and voters with this study in the communication context of education – further research is required to explore the capability of predictive ML models in other contexts. Finally, long self-reported psychological questionnaires may not be suitable for real-world deployment and could be subject to bias, thus a simpler method needs to be devised to gather user profile data such as using a subset of the most predictive features. Practical implications: The findings of this study indicate that leveraging richer profiling data in conjunction with ML approaches may assist in the development of enhanced persuasive systems. There are many applications such as online apps, digital advertising, recommendation systems, chatbots and e-commerce platforms which can benefit from integrating persuasion communication systems that tailor messaging to the individual – potentially translating into higher economic returns. Originality/value: This study integrates sets of features that have heretofore not been used together in developing ML-based predictive models of PC. DAS scale data, which relate to dysfunctional beliefs and cognitive vulnerabilities, were assessed for their importance in identifying effective persuasion techniques. Additionally, the work compares a range of persuasion techniques that thus far have only been studied separately. This study also demonstrates the application of various ML methods in predicting the influence of linguistic styles/persuasion techniques within textual statements and show that a robust methodology comparing a range of ML algorithms is important in the discovery of a performant model. © 2023, Annye Braca and Pierpaolo Dondio.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled text-to-speech transformation has been widely employed to deliver online information in various fields. However, few studies have investigated the effect of the AI voice in environmental risk communication, especially in the field of climate change, an issue that poses a severe threat to global public health. To address this gap, the current study examines how the AI voice impacts the persuasive outcome of climate-related information and the potential mechanism that underlies this process. Based on the social and affect heuristics of voice, we propose a serial mediation model to test the effect of climate-related information delivered by different voice types (AI voice vs. human voice) in eliciting risk perception and motivating pro-environmental behavioral intention. Through an online auditory experiment (N = 397), we found the following. First, the AI voice was as effective as the human voice in eliciting risk perception and motivating pro-environmental behavioral intention. Second, compared with human voice, the AI voice yielded a listener’s lower level of perceived identity oneness with the speaker, which decreased risk perception and subsequently inhibited pro-environmental behavioral intention. Third, compared with human voice, the AI voice produced a higher level of auditory fear, which increased risk perception and thereby led to stronger pro-environmental behavioral intention. The paradoxical role of the AI voice and its wise use in environmental risk communication for promoting global public health are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most relevant technologies of our time. During the last decade, AI has made major technological breakthroughs most recently in the space of generative AI. This development is enabled by an increase in computing power, a decrease in its price, and the emergence of ubiquitous computing, resulting in vast amounts of storable and processable data. However, the diffusion of AI depends on its legitimacy in society, whereby legitimacy is understood as the congruence between organizational activities and their cultural environment. This study aims at understanding the process whereby AI is being (de)legitimated across key industries and over time. To capture and trace the process of legitimation, we rely on media coverage as a form of societal discourse reflecting the legitimation process of AI. We find that the legitimation process gathers momentum in the mid-2010s and the legitimacy of AI increases over time. Furthermore, we identify four types of legitimacy discourse, which integrate sentiment, specific media frames, and appeals of persuasion. Uncovering the four types of legitimacy discourse, we aim at supporting organizations seeking to understand the legitimacy of specific AI applications and how these legitimacy judgments can shift. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Persuasion is omnipresent in our daily communication. As a mechanism for changing or forming one’s opinion or behavior, persuasive dialogues and their strategies have gained interest for developing intelligent conversational systems. Given the complexity of this task, persuasion systems, especially dealing in conversations that require ‘no action’ by the user but rather a change in opinion or belief, require specialized annotated corpora and the understanding of logical structure, natural language, and persuasive strategies. The sparsity of available annotated data and a wide range of proposed models make it challenging for developing strategic chatbots specific to user needs. To address these issues, this study introduces a novel framework combining a replicable data collection tool and a topic-independent annotation schema for designing an argument-graph corpus and incorporating both persuader and persuadee perspectives, essential for building smart conversational agents. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Persuasion modeling is a key building block for conversational agents. Existing works in this direction are limited to analyzing textual dialogue corpora. We argue that visual signals also play an important role in understanding human persuasive behaviors. In this paper, we introduce the first multimodal dataset for modeling persuasion behaviors. Our dataset includes 199 dialogue transcriptions and videos captured in a multi-player social deduction game setting, 26, 647 utterance level annotations of persuasion strategy, and game level annotations of deduction game outcomes. We provide extensive experiments to show how dialogue context and visual signals benefit persuasion strategy prediction. We also explore the generalization ability of language models for persuasion modeling and the role of persuasion strategies in predicting social deduction game outcomes. Our dataset can be found at https://persuasion-deductiongame.socialai-data.org.

AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) are often included as virtual coaches in eHealth applications. Tailoring conversations with these coaches to the individual user can increase the effectiveness of the coaching. An improvement for this tailoring process could be to (automatically) tailor the conversation at the topic level. In this article, we describe the design and evaluation of a blueprint topic model for use in the implementation of such topic selection. First, we constructed a topic model by extracting actions from the literature that a CA as coach could perform. We divided these actions in groups and labeled them with topics. We included literature from the behavioral psychology, relational agents and persuasive technology domains. Second, we evaluated this topic model through an online closed card sort study with health coaching experts. The constructed topic model contains 30 topics and 115 actions. Overall, the sorting of actions into topics was validated by the 11 experts participating in the card sort. Cards with actions that were sorted incorrectly mostly missed an immediacy indicator in their description (e.g., the difference between “you could plan regular walks” as opposed to “let’s plan a walk”) and/or were based on behavior change techniques that were difficult to translate to a conversation. The blueprint topic model presented in this article is an important step towards more intelligent virtual coaches. Future research should focus on the implementation of automatic topic selection. Furthermore, tailoring of coaching dialogues with CAs in multiple steps could be further investigated, for example, from the technical or user interaction perspective. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Stampede Theory: Human Nature, Technology, and Runaway Social Realities explores the biological, evolutionary and technological systems that drive troubling patterns of behavior among groups while also proposing actions to combat harm. The book discusses different ways that living beings coordinate and how the emergence of communication technologies has changed behaviors. As the problem of echo chambers and misinformation grows, it is crucial to understand underlying causes and provide solutions—this book does just that by pulling from multiple fields to produce a coherent story about how social realities are created and how they can create resilient communities or reinforce damaging beliefs. This interdisciplinary approach rests on three primary pillars: 1) How information systems affect the distribution of ideas, information, influence and belief; 2. Technology-mediated communication between individuals and groups, from stories pressed into clay tablets to “likes” on social media; 3) The sociology of behavioral bias in groups ranging from teams to nations. Because of its interdisciplinary foundations, the book includes chapters that address behavioral economics, cults, artificial intelligence, and the individual psychology of belief.  This will be a valuable resource for a range of readers, from political and social scientists to decision-makers in government and business, scientists in the fields of machine learning and AI, and more. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Several years ago, a characteristic of leadership was the intelligence index, but in recent years this has changed, and emotional intelligence is considered an important parameter for a leader. A leader who shows a high index of emotional intelligence can activate his/her human potential and subsequently others. There is a large body of literature on “what” great leaders should do, but more emphasis needs to be placed on “how” to develop such leaders by focusing on detailed individual behavior change and self-development. The current article aims to investigate the concept of emotional intelligence and describe the levels of the emotional intelligence pyramid model and how these are reflected in the role of leadership. The theoretical model is complemented by a set of metacognitive and metaemotional strategies while emphasizing the role of technologies to provide fertile ground for the implementation of emotional intelligence skills in leadership. The strategies framework provides a training paradigm for implementation in education and working environments. The results of this article provide a new theoretical framework of the emotional skills a leader must possess, and they also provide a useful framework for cultivating them, which will promote long-term human capital development and help everyone achieve educational and professional success. The pyramid model of emotional intelligence and its strategies can have practical applications in any form of leadership, as research has shown a positive correlation between these two concepts. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) have become ubiquitous in our daily lives. Recognizing the potential of CAs being persuasive agents, we are interested in leveraging CAs to reduce compulsive smartphone use, a widespread behavior among young adults that can lead to negative consequences. This work presents the design and development of StayFocused, a mobile app incorporating a chatbot to assist people in setting focus goals and reflecting on their phone-checking behaviors in situ. Particularly, we highlight the iterative process of curating prompts for GPT-3, and the lessons learned from our trials and errors. With StayFocused, we propose a three-week between-subjects study with college students. We envision the design of StayFocused and the proposed study will deepen our understanding of how CAs support immediate actions as well as sustained behavior change, and inform the design of persuasive technologies for reducing unintended behaviors such as compulsive smartphone use.  © 2023 Owner/Author.

AB  - Our eating decisions are guided by several psychological dimensions: cognitive, emotional, value-based, social, and behavioural. The social psychology of eating helps us understand these dimensions and how we can promote healthy and sustainable eating to improve people's wellbeing. What is most important in deciding what we want to eat? What drives people to go vegan? Do we tend to eat more when we are nervous? Does it change our behavior when we sit at the table with others? Why do we put off starting the diet until the next week? How does online and offline communication influence our eating behaviour? Is it possible to help people change their eating habits thanks to artificial intelligence? These and other questions are answered in this book, with up-to-date literature references and pointers to the most promising developments in the field. An essential text for undergraduate and graduate students, as well as researchers in the fields of psychology and nutrition. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Planning for goal-oriented dialogue often requires simulating future dialogue interactions and estimating task progress. Many approaches thus consider training neural networks to perform look-ahead search algorithms such as A* search and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, this training often requires abundant annotated data, which creates challenges when faced with noisy annotations or low-resource settings. We introduce GDP-ZERO, an approach using Open-Loop MCTS to perform goal-oriented dialogue policy planning without any model training. GDP-ZERO prompts a large language model to act as a policy prior, value function, user simulator, and system model during the tree search. We evaluate GDP-ZERO on the goal-oriented task PersuasionForGood, and find that its responses are preferred over ChatGPT up to 59.32% of the time, and are rated more persuasive than ChatGPT during interactive evaluations. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - There is growing awareness that effective emotion regulation is critical for health, adjustment and wellbeing. Emerging evidence suggests that interventions that promote flexible emotion regulation may have the potential to reduce the incidence and prevalence of mental health problems in specific at-risk populations. The challenge is how best to engage with at risk populations, who may not be actively seeking assistance, to deliver this early intervention approach. One possible solution is via digital technology and development, which has rapidly accelerated in this space. Such rapid growth has, however, occurred at the expense of developing a deep understanding of key elements of successful program design and specific mechanisms that influence health behavior change. This paper presents a detailed description of the design, development and evaluation of an emotion regulation intervention conversational agent (ERICA) who acts as a digital coach. ERICA uses interactive conversation to encourage self-reflection and to support and empower users to learn a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies including Refocusing, Reappraisal, Planning and Putting into Perspective. A pilot evaluation of ERICA was conducted with 138 university students and confirmed that ERICA provided a feasible and highly usable method for delivering an emotion regulation intervention. The results also indicated that ERICA was able to develop a therapeutic relationship with participants and increase their intent to use a range of cognitive emotion regulation strategies. These findings suggest that ERICA holds potential to be an effective approach for delivering an early intervention to support mental health and wellbeing. ERICA’s dialogue, embedded with interactivity, therapeutic alliance and empathy cues, provide the basis for the development of other psychoeducation interventions. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, the misinformation problem has been addressed with a crowdsourcing-based approach: to assess the truthfulness of a statement, instead of relying on a few experts, a crowd of non-expert is exploited. We study whether crowdsourcing is an effective and reliable method to assess truthfulness during a pandemic, targeting statements related to COVID-19, thus addressing (mis)information that is both related to a sensitive and personal issue and very recent as compared to when the judgment is done. In our experiments, crowd workers are asked to assess the truthfulness of statements, and to provide evidence for the assessments. Besides showing that the crowd is able to accurately judge the truthfulness of the statements, we report results on workers’ behavior, agreement among workers, effect of aggregation functions, of scales transformations, and of workers background and bias. We perform a longitudinal study by re-launching the task multiple times with both novice and experienced workers, deriving important insights on how the behavior and quality change over time. Our results show that workers are able to detect and objectively categorize online (mis)information related to COVID-19; both crowdsourced and expert judgments can be transformed and aggregated to improve quality; worker background and other signals (e.g., source of information, behavior) impact the quality of the data. The longitudinal study demonstrates that the time-span has a major effect on the quality of the judgments, for both novice and experienced workers. Finally, we provide an extensive failure analysis of the statements misjudged by the crowd-workers. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Mixed-initiative dialogue tasks involve repeated exchanges of information and conversational control. Conversational agents gain control by generating responses that follow particular dialogue intents or strategies, prescribed by a policy planner. The standard approach has been fine-tuning pre-trained language models to perform generation conditioned on these intents. However, these supervised generation models are limited by the cost and quality of data annotation. We instead prompt large language models as a drop-in replacement to fine-tuning on conditional generation. We formalize prompt construction for controllable mixed-initiative dialogue. Our findings show improvements over fine-tuning and ground truth responses according to human evaluation and automatic metrics for two tasks: PersuasionForGood and Emotional Support Conversations. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Purpose: Harmonizing religion and economic pursuits is treacherous because mixing the two rarely resonate with consumers, often resulting consumers’ greed perceptions. This paper aims to explore the antecedents and consequence of consumers’ greed perceptions in the context of for-profit religious-affiliated companies (FPRCs) and how they can harmonize religious and commercial missions by using different ad types (direct vs indirect appeal). Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted two experiments: Study 1 was an online experiment with participants from the USA collected through Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (n = 410) to reveal the overall mechanism. Study 2 was a field experiment (n = 292) to corroborate Study 1’s findings. The authors analyzed the data using a multigroup structural equation model. Findings: First, consumers perceive greed against FPRCs’ dual identities incurred by their commercial activities. Second, when FPRCs obscure their religious identities by using third-party organizations (TPOs) as its promoter (i.e. indirect appeal), consumers’ greed perceptions decline, but this does not increase consumers’ future patronage intentions. Finally, in online and field experiments, consumers enhance their purchase intentions and behavior, respectively, under indirect appeal. Research limitations/implications: First, further investigation of the cognitive dissonance mechanism when consumers face seemingly contradictory identities of organizations is crucial to identify bottlenecks in promoting FPRCs’ commercial offerings. Second, examining boundary conditions of indirect appeal is important to enhance our understanding of FPRCs’ advertising, such as consumers’ awareness of TPOs’ intentionality. Lastly, not every type of indirect appeal brings the same effects. Future studies may explore diverse forms of indirect appeal, such as using artificial intelligence-based algorithms without TPOs. Practical implications: Despite heightened interest in supporting dual missions (i.e. purpose and profit), this study shows why doing well while doing good is inherently challenging in practice creating marketing liability. To deal with this, the present findings suggest that, first, rather than exposing an FPRC’s religious (or communal) identity upfront, providing subtle cues through a TPO of its religious affiliation can be persuasive to win the hearts of target customers. Second, given the short-term effectiveness of indirect appeal, FPRCs need to use both direct and indirect appeal flexibly, as each type of ad delivers a distinctive advantage. Lastly, indirect appeal is particularly effective in offline promotional activities in the context of FPRCs. Originality/value: First, by meshing paradox theory, the authors show that dual identities of FPRCs expose them to a marketing liability that single-mission enterprises rarely face. Second, when FPRCs use indirect appeal, they face a tradeoff between mitigating greed perception and securing future patronage. Third, results from the online experiment and field experiment show when consumers’ intention and actual behavior align. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Phase change materials (PCMs) have been attracting increasing interest in computer bionics and artificial intelligence neuron systems. However, the influence of interface between Si3N4 and PCMs on phase chang behavior is still unclear. In this paper, phase change performance and crystallization behavior of homogeneous Sb film are adjusted by changing the thickness of the Si3N4 film and the iteration period. Sb film covered by Si3N4 has better thermal stability, better data retention, and higher crystallization rate due to that the stable Si3N4 can reduce the long-range order and inhibit the nano-size growth of Sb crystal grains. The low element diffusion between Sb and Si3N4 is favorable to stabilize the nano-interface and significantly improve the resistance drift. The resistance polymorphism including high, intermediate, and low resistance states can be obtained by annealing at different temperatures. The ability to achieve such a multilevel resistance state is ascribed to the nucleation-dominated crystallization mode. © 2023

AB  - The widespread use of computers, digital cellular phones, and the Internet has the potential to improve health care and make it more person-centered. The goal of digital health is to provide more effective and efficient health care through the use of information and communication technologies. Technology-driven change has impacted less on health care in the past than it has on other industries, but this is changing as obstacles to its uptake are overcome. These include disparities in access and engagement with digital technologies, concerns about privacy and security of sensitive health information, limited evidence for effectiveness and concerns about safety (e.g. using mental health apps) and concerns about robots replacing clinicians. As these obstacles are overcome, digital health may enable care that is more person centered (of, with, for and by the person). This can be achieved through more individualized assessment; enhanced sharing of decision making and collaborative treatment planning; and by supporting health behavior change and greater participation in self-management. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Caries risk assessment (CRA) is essential to delivering personalized/precision care in caries management. Limited formal evaluation and validation of existing CRA tools affects the ability to accurately predict new lesions. However, this should not prevent clinicians from assessing modifiable risk factors to guide preventive measures and address individual needs to personalize care. Since caries is a multifactorial and dynamic disease process, CRA is complex and impacted by multiple variables throughout the life course, demanding periodic re-assessment. Many factors can influence caries risk at the individual, family, and community level; however, unfortunately, caries experience is still considered one of the greatest indicators of future risk for caries. CRA tools that are validated, inexpensive, and easy to use should be developed and prioritized to help support decision-making to implement evidence based, and minimally invasive caries management strategies for coronal caries lesions in children, adults, and older persons. Efforts into developing CRA tools should include evaluation and reporting of internal and external validation information. In the future, approaches using big data and artificial intelligence may drive risk predictions, and cost-effectiveness analyses may help derive the selection of appropriate risk thresholds for decision-making. Because of the importance of CRA in the treatment planning and decision-making process, challenges for implementation including how to communicate risk to drive behavior change, development of tools that are quick and easy to integrate seamlessly into the busy clinical flow, and reimbursement for the time needed to implement should be considered. © 2023 S.

AB  - Interventions to improve health and well-being abound. Whether they are designed for prevention, maintenance or improvement, a key challenge is the motivation of the user to change their current behaviours, such as persisting or taking new actions. To encourage someone to change their behaviour requires persuading them to change their goals and/or their beliefs about the behaviour or their ability to perform it. Our embodied conversational agent (ECA) uses explanations based on the goals and beliefs of the user to promote a sense of personalisation and engagement with the treatment plan which could form a bond as the dyad develop shared goals and tasks together. To keep our message minimal and understand whether belief-based or goal-based explanations are more efficacious in changing behaviour intention, we collected data in the context of a scenario where the ECA seeks to change four behaviours recommended to help students manage their study stress. Our findings suggest that when the behaviour requires a change in desire, we need goal-based explanation, when adoption of the behaviour requires addressing a barrier we need belief-based explanation and warrant future investigation. Further, the stratified analysis suggested that more tailoring to the student’s context could provide more motivation to change. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Two studies tested the hypothesis that a Large Language Model (LLM) can be used to model psychological change following exposure to influential input. The first study tested a generic mode of influence - the Illusory Truth Effect (ITE) - where earlier exposure to a statement boosts a later truthfulness test rating. Analysis of newly collected data from human and LLM-simulated subjects (1000 of each) showed the same pattern of effects in both populations; although with greater per statement variability for the LLM. The second study concerns a specific mode of influence – populist framing of news to increase its persuasion and political mobilization. Newly collected data from simulated subjects was compared to previously published data from a 15-country experiment on 7286 human participants. Several effects from the human study were replicated by the simulated study, including ones that surprised the authors of the human study by contradicting their theoretical expectations; but some significant relationships found in human data were not present in the LLM data. Together the two studies support the view that LLMs have potential to act as models of the effect of influence. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Despite their prevalence in eHealth applications for behavior change, persuasive messages tend to have small effects on behavior. Conditions or states (e.g., confidence, knowledge, motivation) and characteristics (e.g., gender, age, personality) of persuadees are two promising components for more effective algorithms for choosing persuasive messages. However, it is not yet sufficiently clear how well considering these components allows one to predict behavior after persuasive attempts, especially in the long run. Since collecting data for many algorithm components is costly and places a burden on users, a better understanding of the impact of individual components in practice is welcome. This can help to make an informed decision on which components to use. We thus conducted a longitudinal study in which a virtual coach persuaded 671 daily smokers to do preparatory activities for quitting smoking and becoming more physically active, such as envisioning one's desired future self. Based on the collected data, we designed a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-approach that considers current and future states to maximize the effort people spend on their activities. Using this RL-approach, we found, based on leave-one-out cross-validation, that considering states helps to predict both behavior and future states. User characteristics and especially involvement in the activities, on the other hand, only help to predict behavior if used in combination with states rather than alone. We see these results as supporting the use of states and involvement in persuasion algorithms.

AB  - Digitalization and sustainability have been considered as critical elements in tackling a growing problem of solid waste in the framework of circular economy (CE). Although digitalization can enhance time-efficiency and/or cost-efficiency, their end-results do not always lead to sustainability. So far, the literatures still lack of a holistic view in understanding the development trends and key roles of digitalization in waste recycling industry to benefit stakeholders and to protect the environment. To bridge this knowledge gap, this work systematically investigates how leveraging digitalization in waste recycling industry could address these research questions: (1) What are the key problems of solid waste recycling? (2) How the trends of digitalization in waste management could benefit a CE? (3) How digitalization could strengthen waste recycling industry in a post-pandemic era? While digitalization boosts material flows in a CE, it is evident that utilizing digital solutions to strengthen waste recycling business could reinforce a resource-efficient, low-carbon, and a CE. In the Industry 4.0 era, digitalization can add 15% (about USD 15.7 trillion) to global economy by 2030. As digitalization grows, making the waste sector shift to a CE could save between 30% and 35% of municipalities' waste management budget. With digitalization, a cost reduction of 3.6% and a revenue increase of 4.1% are projected annually. This would contribute to USD 493 billion in an increasing revenue yearly in the next decade. As digitalization enables tasks to be completed shortly with less manpower, this could save USD 421 billion annually for the next decade. With respect to environmental impacts, digitalization in the waste sector could reduce global CO2 emissions by 15% by 2030 through technological solutions. Overall, this work suggests that digitalization in the waste sector contributes net-zero emission to a digital economy, while transitioning to a sustainable world as its social impacts. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, task-oriented virtual assistants have gained huge popularity and demand in both research and industry communities. The primary aim of a task-oriented dialogue agent is to assist end-users in accomplishing a task successfully and satisfactorily. Existing virtual agents have acquired proficiency in assisting users in solving simple tasks such as restaurant bookings. However, they operate under the deterministic presumption that end-users will have a servable task objective, which makes them inadequate under adversarial situations such as goal unavailability. On the other hand, human agents accomplish users’ tasks even in many goal unavailability scenarios by persuading them towards a similar goal to the user's proposed task. Motivated by the limitation, the current work proposes and builds a novel transformer-based context-aware personalized persuasive virtual assistant (CoPersUasive VA), which also serves end-users in task unavailability situations. The proposed CoPersUasive VA recognizes goal conflicts through user sentiment and identifies an appropriate persuasion strategy using ongoing dialogue context and user personality. Depending on users’ proposed goals, it finds a similar servable goal and persuades them with the identified persuasion strategy. The obtained experimental results and detailed post-analysis firmly establish that the proposed model effectively enhances the capability of task-oriented virtual assistants to deal with the task failures caused by goal unavailability. The obtained findings also suggest the crucial role of dialogue context in identifying an appropriate and appealing persuasion strategy. The proposed CoPersUasive model could easily be adapted to any other domain by fine-tuning the model on an underlying task. Furthermore, we developed a personalized persuasive multi-intent conversational dialogue corpus annotated with intent, slot, sentiment, and dialogue act for electronic domain. © 2022

AB  - Background: Obesity is a public health issue worldwide. Conversational agents (CAs), also frequently called chatbots, are computer programs that simulate dialogue between people. Owing to better accessibility, cost-effectiveness, personalization, and compassionate patient-centered treatments, CAs are expected to have the potential to provide sustainable lifestyle counseling for weight management. Objective: This systematic review aimed to critically summarize and evaluate clinical studies on the effectiveness and feasibility of CAs with unconstrained natural language input for weight management. Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), PsycINFO, and ACM Digital Library were searched up to December 2022. Studies were included if CAs were used for weight management and had a capability for unconstrained natural language input. No restrictions were imposed on study design, language, or publication type. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias assessment tool or the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklist. The extracted data from the included studies were tabulated and narratively summarized as substantial heterogeneity was expected. Results: In total, 8 studies met the eligibility criteria: 3 (38%) randomized controlled trials and 5 (62%) uncontrolled before-and-after studies. The CAs in the included studies were aimed at behavior changes through education, advice on food choices, or counseling via psychological approaches. Of the included studies, only 38% (3/8) reported a substantial weight loss outcome (1.3-2.4 kg decrease at 12-15 weeks of CA use). The overall quality of the included studies was judged as low. Conclusions: The findings of this systematic review suggest that CAs with unconstrained natural language input can be used as a feasible interpersonal weight management intervention by promoting engagement in psychiatric intervention-based conversations simulating treatments by health care professionals, but currently there is a paucity of evidence. Well-designed rigorous randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes, longer treatment duration, and follow-up focusing on CAs' acceptability, efficacy, and safety are warranted. © Eunyoung Noh, Jiyoon Won, Sua Jo, Dae-Hyun Hahm, Hyangsook Lee.

AB  - Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, are automated computer programs powered by natural language processing designed to engage consumers in interactive, one-on-one, personalized text- or voice-based conversations. Focusing on text-based, anthropomorphic social chatbots that can be easily implemented on various digital platforms, this chapter synthesizes the literature on computer-mediated communication and human-computer interaction to provide a comprehensive review of the pivotal factors that can enhance chatbots’ perceived humanness and the key considerations in consumer-chatbot interaction and relationship. Specifically, this chapter first discusses the research findings on the persuasiveness of computer-controlled chatbots in relation to human-controlled avatars. Then, the chapter delves into the various anthropomorphic cues used in chatbot design and messaging, including human identity cues, verbal, and non-verbal cues. Strategies and examples for chatbots to communicate humility in order to mitigate consumers’ frustration when chatbots fail to meet consumers’ expectations are also provided. The chapter next addresses some of the most widely studied mediators of chatbot anthropomorphism-social presence and parasocial interaction-and the under-researched role of emotion in consumer-chatbot interactions. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the “uncanny valley” effect pertaining to people’s feelings of eeriness toward highly human-like chatbots. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - The development of mobile and wearable sensing devices for continuous ketone detection has received tremendous recent attention. These devices have opened the doors to personalized medicine applications related to the management of ketosis and diabetic ketoacidosis and to personalized nutrition and wellness (particularly in connection to ketogenic diet). This review discusses the importance of ketone bodies, past and recent advances in decentralized ketone sensing strategies towards such important biomedical and nutrition applications. Special attention is given to electrochemical sensing platforms for on-site and wearable detection of β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), one of the dominant physiological ketone bodies, and to the challenges of using the corresponding dehydrogenase enzyme for extended on-body BHB monitoring. Future trends, opportunities, and challenges towards frequent home self-testing and continuous monitoring of ketone bodies for personalized healthcare, nutrition, and wellness are discussed in connection to mobile and wearable devices coupled to artificial intelligence towards supporting dietary behavior change. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: To describe the degree of automation in just-in-time, adaptive interventions (JITAIs) assessed in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in any medical specialty, and to assess the completeness of intervention reporting. Study Design and Setting: Systematic scoping review—we searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science, from 1 January 2019 to 2 March 2021, for reports of RCTs assessing JITAIs. We assessed whether study reports included the minimum information required to replicate the interventions based on JITAI frameworks. We described JITAIs according to their automation level using an established framework (partially, highly, or fully automated), and care workload distribution (requiring work from patients, health care professionals [HCPs], both, or neither). Results: We included 88 JITAIs (62%, n = 55 supported chronic illness management and 12%, n = 11 supported health behavior change). Overall, 77% (n = 68) of JITAIs were missing some information required to replicate the intervention (e.g., n = 38, 43% inadequately reported the algorithm used to select intervention components). Only fifteen (17%) JITAIs were fully automated and did not require additional work from HCPs nor patients. Of the remaining JITAIs, 36% required work from both patients and HCPs, and 47% required work from either patients or HCPs. Conclusion: Most JITAIs are not fully automated and require work from the HCPs and patients. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Chatbots are increasingly used to support COVID-19 vaccination programs. Their persuasiveness may depend on the conversation-related context. Objective: This study aims to investigate the moderating role of the conversation quality and chatbot expertise cues in the effects of expressing empathy/autonomy support using COVID-19 vaccination chatbots. Methods: This experiment with 196 Dutch-speaking adults living in Belgium, who engaged in a conversation with a chatbot providing vaccination information, used a 2 (empathy/autonomy support expression: present vs absent) × 2 (chatbot expertise cues: expert endorser vs layperson endorser) between-subject design. Chatbot conversation quality was assessed through actual conversation logs. Perceived user autonomy (PUA), chatbot patronage intention (CPI), and vaccination intention shift (VIS) were measured after the conversation, coded from 1 to 5 (PUA, CPI) and from –5 to 5 (VIS). Results: There was a negative interaction effect of chatbot empathy/autonomy support expression and conversation fallback (CF; the percentage of chatbot answers “I do not understand” in a conversation) on PUA (PROCESS macro, model 1, B=–3.358, SE 1.235, t186=2.718, P=.007). Specifically, empathy/autonomy support expression had a more negative effect on PUA when the CF was higher (conditional effect of empathy/autonomy support expression at the CF level of +1SD: B=–.405, SE 0.158, t186=2.564, P=.011; conditional effects nonsignificant for the mean level: B=–0.103, SE 0.113, t186=0.914, P=.36; conditional effects nonsignificant for the –1SD level: B=0.031, SE=0.123, t186=0.252, P=.80). Moreover, an indirect effect of empathy/autonomy support expression on CPI via PUA was more negative when CF was higher (PROCESS macro, model 7, 5000 bootstrap samples, moderated mediation index=–3.676, BootSE 1.614, 95% CI –6.697 to –0.102; conditional indirect effect at the CF level of +1SD: B=–0.443, BootSE 0.202, 95% CI –0.809 to –0.005; conditional indirect effects nonsignificant for the mean level: B=–0.113, BootSE 0.124, 95% CI –0.346 to 0.137; conditional indirect effects nonsignificant for the –1SD level: B=0.034, BootSE 0.132, 95% CI –0.224 to 0.305). Indirect effects of empathy/autonomy support expression on VIS via PUA were marginally more negative when CF was higher. No effects of chatbot expertise cues were found. Conclusions: The findings suggest that expressing empathy/autonomy support using a chatbot may harm its evaluation and persuasiveness when the chatbot fails to answer its users’ questions. The paper adds to the literature on vaccination chatbots by exploring the conditional effects of chatbot empathy/autonomy support expression. The results will guide policy makers and chatbot developers dealing with vaccination promotion in designing the way chatbots express their empathy and support for user autonomy. ©Wojciech Trzebiński, Toni Claessens, Jeska Buhmann, Aurélie De Waele, Greet Hendrickx, Pierre Van Damme, Walter Daelemans, Karolien Poels.

AB  - The recent success of large language models (LLMs) has shown great potential to develop more powerful conversational recommender systems (CRSs), which rely on natural language conversations to satisfy user needs. In this paper, we embark on an investigation into the utilization of ChatGPT for CRSs, revealing the inadequacy of the existing evaluation protocol. It might overemphasize the matching with ground-truth items annotated by humans while neglecting the interactive nature of CRSs. To overcome the limitation, we further propose an interactive Evaluation approach based on LLMs, named iEvaLM, which harnesses LLM-based user simulators. Our evaluation approach can simulate various system-user interaction scenarios. Through the experiments on two public CRS datasets, we demonstrate notable improvements compared to the prevailing evaluation protocol. Furthermore, we emphasize the evaluation of explainability, and ChatGPT showcases persuasive explanation generation for its recommendations. Our study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the untapped potential of LLMs for CRSs and provides a more flexible and realistic evaluation approach for future research about LLM-based CRSs.

AB  - Mobile health applications (apps) have been shown to be effective for improving eating habits. However, most of the existing apps rely on calorie and nutrient counting which have several limitations including the difficulty in sustaining long-term use, inaccuracy, and the risk of developing eating disorders. We designed and developed a mHealth framework for nutritional behaviour change, integrated into the CarpeDiem app, that focuses on the intake of key food groups which are known to have a higher impact on health indicators instead of the intake of nutrients. This framework is mainly based on a gamified system that delivers personalized dietary missions to the user and provides motivational recommendations that help the user to achieve these missions. Its design was guided by an evidenced-based theory of behavioural change, the HAPA model, and it is also characterized by the personalization of the system and the use of a recommender system based on advanced artificial intelligence techniques. Overall, the approach used in the present app could foster a sustained improvement of eating habits among the general population, which is the main challenge of dietary interventions, decreasing the risk of developing the chronic diseases associated with unhealthy dietary habits. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Along with the popularity of smartphones, artificial intelligence-based personalized suggestions can be seen as promising ways to change eating habits toward more desirable diets. Objectives: Two issues raised by such technologies were addressed in this study. The first hypothesis tested is a recommender system based on automatically learning simple association rules between dishes of the same meal that would make it possible to identify plausible substitutions for the consumer. The second hypothesis tested is that for an identical set of dietary-swaps suggestions, the more the user is—or thinks to be—involved in the process of identifying the suggestion, the higher is their probability of accepting the suggestion. Methods: Three studies are presented in this article, first, we present the principles of an algorithm to mine plausible substitutions from a large food consumption database. Second, we evaluate the plausibility of these automatically mined suggestions through the results of online tests conducted for a group of 255 adult participants. Afterward, we investigated the persuasiveness of 3 suggestion methods of such recommendations in a population of 27 healthy adult volunteers through a custom designed smartphone application. Results: The results firstly indicated that a method based on automatic learning of substitution rules between foods performed relatively well identifying plausible swaps suggestions. Regarding the form that should be used to suggest, we found that when users are involved in selecting the most appropriate recommendation for them, the resulting suggestions were more accepted (OR = 3.168; P < 0.0004). Conclusions: This work indicates that food recommendation algorithms can gain efficiency by taking into account the consumption context and user engagement in the recommendation process. Further research is warranted to identify nutritionally relevant suggestions. © 2023 American Society for Nutrition

AB  - The study involved adolescents (teens) in exploring the potential of conversational agents (CAs) to support adolescents during emotionally difficult times. During the online focus groups, participants were asked to talk about common problems they are experiencing and the conversational support they usually receive, design multi-turn supportive conversations that could be programmed into a CA, and offer recommendations for the features of supportive CAs for teens. Participants talked about stressful experiences that were reported in previous studies, i.e. school and family related problems, peer relationships, and self-image, suggesting that CAs can be programmed to anticipate and address stress/negative emotions related to these common stressors. In expressing preferences for conversational support, participants highlighted the importance of both cognitive (informational) and emotional dimensions in agents' responses. The findings point to the importance of developing CA content that offers teens advice on strategies to cope with negative emotion (advice on behavior change, self-care strategies), and also simply acknowledges their problems and lands an emotional "hearing ear".  © 2023 ACM.

AB  - Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are advanced human-like interfaces that engage users in natural face-to-face conversations and interactions. These traits position ECAs as innovative tools for delivering interventions for promoting health-related behavior adoption. This includes motivational interviewing (MI), a therapeutic approach that combines brief interventions with motivational techniques to encourage the adoption of healthier behaviors. Objective: This study aims to identify the health issues addressed by ECAs delivering MI interventions, explore the key characteristics of these ECAs (eg, appearance, dialogue mechanism, emotional model), analyze the implementation of MI principles and techniques within ECAs, and examine the evaluation methods and primary outcomes of studies that use ECAs providing MI interventions. Methods: We conducted a scoping review following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) methodology. Our systematic search covered the PubMed, Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital, and PsycINFO databases for papers published between January 2008 and December 2022. We included papers describing ECAs developed for delivering MI interventions targeting health-related behaviors and excluded articles that did not describe ECAs with human appearances and without the necessary evaluation or MI explanation. In a multistage process, 3 independent reviewers performed screening and data extraction, and the collected data were synthesized using a narrative approach. Results: The initial search identified 404 articles, of which 3.5% (n=14) were included in the review. ECAs primarily focused on reducing alcohol use (n=5, 36%), took on female representations (n=9, 64%), and gave limited consideration to user ethnicity (n=9, 64%). Most of them used rules-driven dialogue mechanisms (n=13, 93%), include emotional behavior to convey empathy (n=8, 57%) but without an automatic recognition of user emotions (n=12, 86%). Regarding MI implementation, of 14 studies, 3 (21%) covered all MI principles, 4 (29%) included all processes, and none covered all techniques. Most studies (8/14, 57%) conducted acceptability, usability, and user experience assessments, whereas a smaller proportion (4/14, 29%) used randomized controlled trials to evaluate behavior changes. Overall, the studies reported positive results regarding acceptability, usability, and user experience and showed promising outcomes in changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Conclusions: This study revealed significant advancements in the use of ECAs for delivering MI interventions aimed at promoting healthier behaviors over the past 15 years. However, this review emphasizes the need for a more in-depth exploration of ECA characteristics. In addition, there is a need for the enhanced integration of MI principles, processes, and techniques into ECAs. Although acceptability and usability have received considerable attention, there is a compelling argument for placing a stronger emphasis on assessing changes in attitudes, beliefs, motivation, and behavior. Consequently, inclusion of more randomized controlled trials is essential for comprehensive intervention evaluations. ©José Mercado, Ismael Edrein Espinosa-Curiel, Juan Martínez-Miranda.

AB  - The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data in medicine has increased in recent years. Indeed, the use of AI in mobile health (mHealth) apps could considerably assist both individuals and health care professionals in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, in a person-centered manner. Nonetheless, there are several challenges that must be overcome to provide high-quality, usable, and effective mHealth apps. Here, we review the rationale and guidelines for the implementation of mHealth apps and the challenges regarding quality, usability, and user engagement and behavior change, with a special focus on the prevention and management of noncommunicable diseases. We suggest that a cocreation-based framework is the best method to address these challenges. Finally, we describe the current and future roles of AI in improving personalized medicine and provide recommendations for developing AI-based mHealth apps. We conclude that the implementation of AI and mHealth apps for routine clinical practice and remote health care will not be feasible until we overcome the main challenges regarding data privacy and security, quality assessment, and the reproducibility and uncertainty of AI results. Moreover, there is a lack of both standardized methods to measure the clinical outcomes of mHealth apps and techniques to encourage user engagement and behavior changes in the long term. We expect that in the near future, these obstacles will be overcome and that the ongoing European project, Watching the risk factors (WARIFA), will provide considerable advances in the implementation of AI-based mHealth apps for disease prevention and health promotion. © Alejandro Deniz-Garcia, Himar Fabelo, Antonio J Rodriguez-Almeida, Garlene Zamora-Zamorano, Maria Castro-Fernandez, Maria del Pino Alberiche Ruano, Terje Solvoll, Conceição Granja, Thomas Roger Schopf, Gustavo M Callico, Cristina Soguero-Ruiz, Ana M Wägner, WARIFA Consortium.

AB  - The deep learning arena explores new dimensions once considered impossible to human in-telligence. Recently, it has taken footsteps in the biological data world to deal with the diverse patterns of data derived from biomolecules. The convolutional neural networks, one of the most employed and persuasive deep learning architectures, can unravel the sequestered truths from these data, especially from the biological sequences. These neural network variants outperform traditional bioinformatics tools for the enduring tasks associated with such sequences. This work imparts an exciting preface to the basics of convolutional neural network architecture and how it can be instrumented to deal with biological sequence analysis. The approach followed in this paper can provide the reader with an enhanced view of convolutional neural networks, their basic working principles and how they apply to biological sequences. A detailed view of critical steps involved in deep learning, starting from the data preprocessing, architecture designing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation metrics, are portrayed. A comparative analysis of convolutional neural network architectures developed for protein family classification is also discussed. This review contributes significantly to understanding the concepts behind deep learning architectures and their applications in biological sequence analysis. It can lift the barrier of limited knowledge to a great extent on the deep learning concepts and their implementation, especially for people who are deal-ing with pure biology. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Introduction: Obese rodents e.g., the leptin-deficient (ob/ob) mouse exhibit remarkable behavioral changes and are therefore ideal models for evaluating mental disorders resulting from obesity. In doing so, female as well as male ob/ob mice at 8, 24, and 40 weeks of age underwent two common behavioral tests, namely the Open Field test and Elevated Plus Maze, to investigate behavioral alteration in a sex- and age dependent manner. The accuracy of these tests is often dependent on the observer that can subjectively influence the data. Methods: To avoid this bias, mice were tracked with a video system. Video files were further analyzed by the compared use of two software, namely EthoVision (EV) and DeepLabCut (DLC). In DLC a Deep Learning application forms the basis for using artificial intelligence in behavioral research in the future, also with regard to the reduction of animal numbers. Results: After no sex and partly also no age-related differences were found, comparison revealed that both software lead to almost identical results and are therefore similar in their basic outcomes, especially in the determination of velocity and total distance movement. Moreover, we observed additional benefits of DLC compared to EV as it enabled the interpretation of more complex behavior, such as rearing and leaning, in an automated manner. Discussion: Based on the comparable results from both software, our study can serve as a starting point for investigating behavioral alterations in preclinical studies of obesity by using DLC to optimize and probably to predict behavioral observations in the future.

AB  - ChatGPT as an innovative AI-based language generation chatbot has drawn a large amount of attention from educators and researchers in academia. Though ChatGPT possesses advanced technological functions, users from the educational field hold different opinions and attitudes toward ChatGPT. As using ChatGPT is becoming a non-stoppable trend, most educators and administrators changed their attitude from panic and prohibition to welcoming and embracing. This paper borrowed the concepts of attitude and attitude change from social psychology, and explained the attitude change toward ChatGPT among educators in higher education. Based on the ABC model of attitude and social judgment theory, we developed a conceptual model of attitude and attitude change from T1 to T2. We propose there will be a significant difference between attitude at T1 and that at T2 and explain such a change by using social judgement theory to highlight the significance of stimuli or persuasive messages from universities. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Behavior change support agents are most effective when they are personalized to the user’s goals and motivations. To achieve this the agent should be able to create a user model based on limited initial inputs from the user. We demonstrate how autoepistemic logic can be used to build a model which combines direct input from the user with assumptions about the user’s reasoning. These beliefs can be used when reasoning about the user’s motivations, but they may also be rejected when presented with conflicting information. This results in a user model in which both knowledge and beliefs about the user are included but still clearly separated. We illustrate our ideas using an example of a behavior support agent which assists the user in exercising more. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - With the rapid growth of Extended Reality (XR) technologies for training purposes, it has become essential to incorporate Artificial Intelligence (AI) modules into the simulations to assist trainers and trainees. One powerful AI solution is the use of recommender systems (RS) to enhance user interactions and experiences in immersive training. This work explores the integration of a RS into an XR training platform and focuses on the design of persuasive interfaces to present recommendations. Personalised training goals can be achieved for more successful outcomes by allowing trainers to modify training scenarios during the exercise. The goal of this work is to illustrate how effective integration of AI and persuasive interfaces in XR training platforms can result in successful and personalised training outcomes. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Objective: Long term behavioural disturbances and interventions in healthy habits (mainly eating and physical activity) are the primary cause of childhood obesity. Current approaches for obesity prevention based on health information extraction lack the integration of multi-modal datasets and the provision of a dedicated Decision Support System (DSS) for health behaviour assessment and coaching of children. Methods: Continuous co-creation process has been applied in the frame of the Design Thinking Methodology, involving children, educators and healthcare professional in the whole process. Such considerations were used to derive the user needs and the technical requirements needed for the conception of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform based on microservices. Results: To promote the adoption of healthy habits and the prevention of the obesity onset for children (9-12 years old), the proposed solution empowers children -including families and educators- in taking control of their health by collecting and following-up real-time information about nutrition, physical activity data coming from IoT devices, and interconnecting healthcare professionals to provide a personalised coaching solution. The validation has two phases involving +400 children (control/intervention group), on four schools in three countries: Spain, Greece and Brazil. The prevalence of obesity decreased in 75.5% from baseline levels in the intervention group. The proposed solution created a positive impression and satisfaction from the technology acceptance perspective. Conclusions: Main findings confirm that this ecosystem can assess behaviours of children, motivating and guiding them towards achieving personal goals. Clinical and Translational Impact Statement - This study presents Early Research on the adoption of a smart childhood obesity caring solution adopting a multidisciplinary approach; it involves researchers from biomedical engineering, medicine, computer science, ethics and education. The solution has the potential to decrease the obesity rates in children aiming to impact to get a better global health. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding and optimizing adolescent-specific engagement with behavior change interventions will open doors for providers to promote healthy changes in an age group that is simultaneously difficult to engage and especially important to affect. For digital interventions, there is untapped potential in combining the vastness of process-level data with the analytical power of artificial intelligence (AI) to understand not only how adolescents engage but also how to improve upon interventions with the goal of increasing engagement and, ultimately, efficacy. Rooted in the example of the INSPIRE narrative-centered digital health behavior change intervention (DHBCI) for adolescent risky behaviors around alcohol use, we propose a framework for harnessing AI to accomplish 4 goals that are pertinent to health care providers and software developers alike: measurement of adolescent engagement, modeling of adolescent engagement, optimization of current interventions, and generation of novel interventions. Operationalization of this framework with youths must be situated in the ethical use of this technology, and we have outlined the potential pitfalls of AI with particular attention to privacy concerns for adolescents. Given how recently AI advances have opened up these possibilities in this field, the opportunities for further investigation are plenty. © Alison Giovanelli, Jonathan Rowe, Madelynn Taylor, Mark Berna, Kathleen P Tebb, Carlos Penilla, Marianne Pugatch, James Lester, Elizabeth M Ozer.

AB  - This article presents an empirical requirement elicitation study for an argumentation-based digital companion for supporting behavior change, whose ultimate goal is the promotion and facilitation of healthy behavior. The study was conducted with non-expert users as well as with health experts and was in part supported by the development of prototypes. It focuses on human-centric aspects, in particular user motivations, as well as on expectations and perceptions regarding the role and interaction behavior of a digital companion. Based on the results of the study, a framework for person tailoring the agent's roles and behaviors, and argumentation schemes are proposed. The results indicate that the extent to which a digital companion argumentatively challenges or supports a user's attitudes and chosen behavior and how assertive and provocative the companion is may have a substantial and individualized effect on user acceptance, as well as on the effects of interacting with the digital companion. More broadly, the results shed some initial light on the perception of users and domain experts of “soft,” meta-level aspects of argumentative dialogue, indicating potential for future research.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence is all about making machines more intelligent so that they can think and work like humans to make their work easy. The fundamental principle of employing a technology to model smart action with minimal user interaction is known to simply "AI." Perhaps most importantly, human intelligence served as the core model for early automation initiatives. The objective was to mimic smart person conduct in machines by discovering and replicating the intellectual systems that underlying individual intelligence.

AB  - Background: Individuals with disabilities living with chronic health conditions require self-management programs that are accessible, sustainable, inclusive, and adaptable. Health coaching is an effective approach to promoting behavior change in self-management. Health coaching combined with telehealth technology has the potential to improve the overall quality of, and access to, health services. Objective: This protocol outlines the study design for implementing the My Health, My Life, My Way intervention. The study will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the intervention for people with disabilities and optimize it. Methods: The My Health, My Life, My Way study is a 4-arm randomized controlled trial evaluating the delivery of a 6-month intervention involving telecoaching, inclusive educational content, and technology access for 200 individuals with chronic conditions and physical disabilities. This study uses the engineering-inspired multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework to evaluate intervention components and assess whether a combination or lack of individual elements influences behavior. Participants will be randomized to 1 of 4 study arms: scheduled coaching calls and gamified rewards, no scheduled coaching calls and gamified rewards, scheduled coaching calls and flat rewards, and no scheduled coaching calls and flat rewards. Results: The My Health, My Life, My Way study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, and recruitment and enrollment will begin in May 2023. Data analysis is expected to be completed within 6 months of ending data collection. This clinical trial protocol was developed based on the SPIRIT (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials) 2013 statement. Conclusions: The My Health, My Life, My Way study will help to optimize and improve our understanding of the feasibility and efficacy of a web-based self-management program for people with physical disabilities and chronic conditions. More specifically, My Health, My Life, My Way will determine which combination of interventions (coaching calls and gamification) will result in increased participation in self-management programming. The My Health, My Life, My Way intervention has the potential to become a scalable and novel method to successfully manage chronic conditions in people with disabilities. © Eric Evans, Ayse Zengul, Amy Knight, Amanda Willig, Andrea Cherrington, Tapan Mehta, Mohanraj Thirumalai.

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) applications are widely used in interactions with end users. However, there remains a lack of understanding of how the different characteristics of these systems, particularly the anthropomorphic design and the type of explanations provided interact to affect user reactions to AI. We address this research gap by building on social response theory (SRT), prior XAI and anthropomorphic design literature, to investigate how anthropomorphic design (human-like vs. machine-like) and types of explanations (consensual, expert, internal, empirical validation-based explanations) affect user reactions to AI (perceived trust and persuasiveness) and acceptance of AI systems. We will evaluate the proposed research model by conducting a 2 × 4 between-subjects experiment. This study will enrich the theoretical landscape of anthropomorphic design and human-AI interaction (HAII), offering actionable insights into user perception and acceptance for XAI practitioners.

AB  - Background: The minimally invasive nature of thoracoscopic surgery is well recognized; however, the absence of a reliable evaluation method remains challenging. We hypothesized that the postoperative recovery speed is closely linked to surgical invasiveness, where recovery signifies the patient’s behavior transition back to their preoperative state during the perioperative period. Objective: This study aims to determine whether machine learning using triaxial acceleration data can effectively capture perioperative behavior changes and establish a quantitative index for quantifying variations in surgical invasiveness. Methods: We trained 7 distinct machine learning models using a publicly available human acceleration data set as supervised data. The 3 top-performing models were selected to predict patient actions, as determined by the Matthews correlation coefficient scores. Two patients who underwent different levels of invasive thoracoscopic surgery were selected as participants. Acceleration data were collected via chest sensors for 8 hours during the preoperative and postoperative hospitalization days. These data were categorized into 4 actions (walking, standing, sitting, and lying down) using the selected models. The actions predicted by the model with intermediate results were adopted as the actions of the participants. The daily appearance probability was calculated for each action. The 2 differences between 2 appearance probabilities (sitting vs standing and lying down vs walking) were calculated using 2 coordinates on the x-and y-axes. A 2D vector composed of coordinate values was defined as the index of behavior pattern (iBP) for the day. All daily iBPs were graphed, and the enclosed area and distance between points were calculated and compared between participants to assess the relationship between changes in the indices and invasiveness. Results: Patients 1 and 2 underwent lung lobectomy and incisional tumor biopsy, respectively. The selected predictive model was a light-gradient boosting model (mean Matthews correlation coefficient 0.98, SD 0.0027; accuracy: 0.98). The acceleration data yielded 548,466 points for patient 1 and 466,407 points for patient 2. The iBPs of patient 1 were [(0.32, 0.19), (–0.098, 0.46), (–0.15, 0.13), (–0.049, 0.22)] and those of patient 2 were [(0.55, 0.30), (0.77, 0.21), (0.60, 0.25), (0.61, 0.31)]. The enclosed areas were 0.077 and 0.0036 for patients 1 and 2, respectively. Notably, the distances for patient 1 were greater than those for patient 2 ({0.44, 0.46, 0.37, 0.26} vs {0.23, 0.0065, 0.059}; P=.03 [Mann-Whitney U test]). Conclusions: The selected machine learning model effectively predicted the actions of the surgical patients with high accuracy. The temporal distribution of action times revealed changes in behavior patterns during the perioperative phase. The proposed index may facilitate the recognition and visualization of perioperative changes in patients and differences in surgical invasiveness. © Kozo Nakanishi, Hidenori Goto.

AB  - The prevalence of type 2 diabetes in North West London (NWL) is relatively high compared to other parts of the United Kingdom with outcomes suboptimal. This presents a need for more effective strategies to identify people living with type 2 diabetes who need additional support. An emerging subset of web-based interventions for diabetes self-management and population management has used artificial intelligence and machine learning models to stratify the risk of complications from diabetes and identify patients in need of immediate support. In this study, two prototype risk prediction tools on the MyWay Diabetes and MyWay Clinical platforms were evaluated with six clinicians and six people living with type 2 diabetes in NWL using the think aloud method. The results of the sessions with people living with type 2 diabetes showed that the concept of the tool was intuitive, however, more instruction on how to correctly use the risk prediction tool would be valuable. The feedback from the sessions with clinicians was that the data presented in the tool aligned with the key diabetes targets in NWL, and that this would be useful for identifying and inviting patients to the practice who are overdue for tests and at risk of complications. The findings of the evaluation have been used to support the development of the prototype risk predictions tools. This study demonstrates the value of conducting usability testing on web-based interventions designed to support the targeted management of type 2 diabetes in local communities. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background: Black boys and men from disinvested communities are disproportionately survivors and perpetrators of youth violence. Those presenting to emergency departments with firearm-related injuries also report recent substance use. However, young Black men face several critical individual and systemic barriers to accessing trauma-focused prevention programs. These barriers contribute to service avoidance, the exacerbation of violence recidivism, substance use relapse, and a revolving-door approach to prevention. In addition, young Black men are known to be digital natives. Therefore, technology-enhanced interventions offer a pragmatic and promising opportunity to mitigate these barriers, provide vital life skills for self-led behavior change, and boost service engagement with vital community resources. Objective: The study aims to systematically adapt and pilot-test Boosting Violence-Related Outcomes Using Technology for Empowerment, Risk Reduction, and Life Skills Preparation in Youth Based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (BrotherlyACT), a culturally congruent, trauma-focused digital psychoeducational and service-engagement tool tailored to young Black men aged 15-24 years. BrotherlyACT will incorporate microlearning modules, interactive safety planning tools for risk assessment, goal-setting, mindfulness practice, and a service-engagement conversational agent or chatbot to connect young Black men to relevant services. Methods: The development of BrotherlyACT will occur in 3 phases. In phase 1, we will qualitatively investigate barriers and facilitators influencing young Black men’s willingness to use violence and substance use prevention services with 15-30 young Black men (aged 15-24 years) who report perpetrating violence and substance use in the past year and 10 service providers (aged >18 years; any gender; including health care providers, street outreach workers, social workers, violence interrupters, community advocates, and school staff). Both groups will be recruited from community and pediatric emergency settings. In phase 2, a steering group of topic experts (n=3-5) and a youth and community advisory board comprising young Black men (n=8-12) and service providers (n=5-10) will be involved in participatory design, alpha testing, and beta testing sessions to develop, refine, and adapt BrotherlyACT based on an existing skills-based program (Achieving Change Through Values-Based Behavior). We will use user-centered design principles and the Assessment, Decision, Administration, Production, Topical, Experts, Integration, Training, and Testing framework to guide this adaptation process (phase 2). In phase 3, a total of 60 young Black men will pilot-test the adapted BrotherlyACT over 10 weeks in a single-group, pretest-posttest design to determine its feasibility and implementation outcomes. Results: Phase 1 data collection began in September 2021. Phases 2 and 3 are scheduled to start in June 2023 and end in September 2024. Conclusions: The development and testing of BrotherlyACT is a crucial first step in expanding an evidence-based psychoeducational and service-mediating intervention for young Black men involved in violence. This colocation of services shifts the current prevention strategy from telling them why to change to teaching them how. © Chuka Emezue, Niranjan S Karnik, Blaine Reeder, Michael Schoeny, Rickey Layfield, Amie Zarling, Wrenetha Julion.

AB  - Osteoporosis is a prevalent medical condition characterized by a reduction in bone mass and density, which significantly increases the risk of fractures. In order to promote optimal bone health, it is essential to acquire relevant information and adopt a lifestyle that safeguards bone integrity. In light of this, the present study employed the Health Belief Model as a framework to design and develop the Bone+ mobile health chatbot platform. Leveraging artificial intelligence technology, the platform utilizes image analysis of X-rays to assess bone density and predict the likelihood of bone loss. Moreover, it offers comprehensive information on osteoporosis prevention, empowering users to make well-informed decisions regarding their bone health. The results obtained from the heuristic evaluation questionnaire of the chatbot platform demonstrated satisfactory usability, thereby further supporting its efficacy as a valuable tool in osteoporosis prevention. © ICT 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - With increasing population, expanding human activities and the effects of climate change, ensuring adequate Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) conditions are crucial for the healthcare, development and well-being of nations and their citizens. The inclusion of WASH within the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) reflects the need to adopt innovative approaches for providing the necessary WASH infrastructure and services. Data Analytics on the WASH indicators help monitor the progress of WASH initiatives, infrastructure availability and conditions, service levels, WASH-related behavior changes, etc. and guide the development of early warning systems. Hence, this work applies Data Analytics on the WASH records from the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) to enable efficient and effective WASH analysis and interventions. Further, the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) technologies and their amalgamation as Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) have the potential to bring transformative changes to WASH practices. This work presents various research directions for addressing the challenges in the WASH sector by implementing AI algorithms on real-time data procured by IoT devices. These AIoT research directions contribute to developing a sustainable WASH ecosystem by enhancing efficiency, identifying indicative patterns, and enabling data-driven decision-making. © 2023 Seventh Sense Research Group®

AB  - In mobile technologies for health and well-being (mHealth), push notifications are a widely used tool to implement persuasive strategies. However, little research has been carried out to investigate the impact of notifications in such technologies and users’ attitudes towards them. In this study, we address this gap by exploring the role of notifications and their customisation in the context of mobile applications that promote social and mental well-being. Based on observational data collected from 152 participants, we investigate users’ attitudes and preferences towards notifications. Moreover, we explore how users’ attitudes towards notifications differ along demographic dimensions. Our findings show that customisation of notifications is a desired feature that can be used to improve the persuasive aspect of mHealth applications. Implications derived from our study can provide guidance for researchers and practitioners alike when designing app notifications to create better motivating, meaningful, and persuasive experiences. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In recent years, the usage of virtual assistants to complete tasks like service scheduling and online shopping has increased in both popularity and need. An end user’s task goals are the main objectives of a task-oriented conversation agent, and those should be served effectively and successfully. Beside that, user satisfaction is one of the most important aspect that should be taken care of. Communication with multi-modal responses makes the conversation easier and more attractive. Responses through proper images can improve the quality of a task oriented conversation in terms of user satisfaction. Keeping these aspects in mind, we propose a framework which infuses multi-modality with an end-to-end persuasive task oriented dialogue generation module. Additionally, we create a personalised persuasive multi-modal dialogue (PPMD) corpus with slot, sentiment, and agent action annotation at turn level that contains multi-modal responses from both ends. The results and thorough analysis on this dataset show that the suggested multi-modal persuasive virtual assistant achieves better performance over traditional task-oriented frameworks in terms of user satisfaction. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Expressive writing and motivational interviewing are well-known approaches to help patients cope with stressful life events. Although these methods are often applied by human counselors, it is less well understood if an automated artificial intelligence approach can benefit patients. Providing an automated method would help expose a wider range of people to the possible benefits of motivational interviewing, with lower cost and more adaptability to sudden events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study presents an automated writing system and evaluates possible outcomes among participants with respect to behavior related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We developed a rule-based dialogue system for “Expressive Interviewing” to elicit writing from participants on the subject of how COVID-19 has impacted their lives. The system prompts participants to describe their life experiences and emotions and provides topic-specific prompts in response to participants’ use of topical keywords. In May 2021 and June 2021, we recruited participants (N=151) via Prolific to complete either the Expressive Interviewing task or a control task. We surveyed participants immediately before the intervention, immediately after the intervention, and again 2 weeks after the intervention. We measured participants’ self-reported stress, general mental health, COVID-19–related health behavior, and social behavior. Results: Participants generally wrote long responses during the task (53.3 words per response). In aggregate, task participants experienced a significant decrease in stress in the short term (~23% decrease, P<.001) and a slight difference in social activity compared with the control group (P=.03). No significant differences in short-term or long-term outcomes were detected between participant subgroups (eg, male versus female participants) except for some within-condition differences by ethnicity (eg, higher social activity among African American people participating in Expressive Interviewing vs participants of other ethnicities). For short-term effects, participants showed different outcomes based on their writing. Using more anxiety-related words was correlated with a greater short-term decrease in stress (r=–0.264, P<.001), and using more positive emotion words was correlated with a more meaningful experience (r=0.243, P=.001). As for long-term effects, writing with more lexical diversity was correlated with an increase in social activity (r=0.266, P<.001). Conclusions: Expressive Interviewing participants exhibited short-term, but not long-term, positive changes in mental health, and some linguistic metrics of writing style were correlated with positive change in behavior. Although there were no significant long-term effects observed, the positive short-term effects suggest that the Expressive Interviewing intervention could be used in cases in which a patient lacks access to traditional therapy and needs a short-term solution. © Ian Stewart, Charles Welch, Lawrence An, Ken Resnicow, James Pennebaker, Rada Mihalcea.

AB  - Digital innovations in Explosive Ordnance Risk Education (EORE) are gaining increasing importance with the rapid development of technology and need for a combination of online and offline, in-person and remote delivery. New innovative technical tools and approaches in EORE include digital media platforms and information services, Extended Reality, Artificial Intelligence, just to name a few. All these are already bringing a significant potential for the EORE and the broader humanitarian mine action sector to scale up risk education work and ensure that more communities at risk can be reached. Beyond simple reach, impact and effectiveness is however more important, as EORE ultimately aims to generate safe behavior. Despite the multiplicity of methods used, fully ascertaining impact and effectiveness is still challenging in the field. Digital EORE itself is also facing several challenges on the ground before it can be further scaled up. This paper reviews the latest innovative approaches in EORE and provides a critical analysis of their scope for scale-up, and of the ways of measuring their impact and effectiveness. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI)–based chatbots can offer personalized, engaging, and on-demand health promotion interventions. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the feasibility, efficacy, and intervention characteristics of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior change. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in 7 bibliographic databases (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library, PsycINFO, Web of Science, Embase, and JMIR publications) for empirical articles published from 1980 to 2022 that evaluated the feasibility or efficacy of AI chatbots for behavior change. The screening, extraction, and analysis of the identified articles were performed by following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Results: Of the 15 included studies, several demonstrated the high efficacy of AI chatbots in promoting healthy lifestyles (n=6, 40%), smoking cessation (n=4, 27%), treatment or medication adherence (n=2, 13%), and reduction in substance misuse (n=1, 7%). However, there were mixed results regarding feasibility, acceptability, and usability. Selected behavior change theories and expert consultation were used to develop the behavior change strategies of AI chatbots, including goal setting, monitoring, real-time reinforcement or feedback, and on-demand support. Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information. However, the reported results need to be interpreted with caution because of the moderate to high risk of internal validity, insufficient description of AI techniques, and limitation for generalizability. Conclusions: AI chatbots have demonstrated the efficacy of health behavior change interventions among large and diverse populations; however, future studies need to adopt robust randomized control trials to establish definitive conclusions. © Abhishek Aggarwal, Cheuk Chi Tam, Dezhi Wu, Xiaoming Li, Shan Qiao.

AB  - The advent of digital transformation has revolutionized the marketing landscape, presenting both challenges and opportunities for businesses. This scientific paper delves into the realm of marketing communications in the context of this transformative era. The primary objective is to examine the profound impact of various marketing communication tools on consumer perception and response to advertising messages, direct marketing, electronic communication, and other innovative marketing techniques. Utilizing the ANOVA (analysis of variance) statistical evaluation method, comprehensive empirical research data are analysed to uncover key trends and insights. The findings shed light on the dynamic market developments characterized by a notable decline in the effectiveness of traditional mass marketing approaches. Instead, there is a discernible shift towards more specialized marketing strategies, bolstered by the rapid advancement of computer and information technologies. Moreover, this study confirms a hypothesis pertaining to the efficacy of Internet advertising in relation to different age groups of customers. This confirmation underscores the importance of leveraging digital platforms and channels to engage specific target audiences effectively. The practical significance of this research lies in its potential to guide marketers in optimizing their marketing budgets, identifying the most impactful communication channels, and discerning statistically significant variations in consumer responses to diverse marketing communication tools. By understanding these nuances, marketers can design more targeted and persuasive marketing campaigns, leading to enhanced customer engagement and improved business outcomes. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - The likelihood that a defendant will reoffend is one of the key considerations that informs sentencing outcomes. It is relevant to the aims of community protection, specific deterrence, and rehabilitation. Despite this, empirical data establishes that judges make poor predictions regarding whether defendants will reoffend. Algorithms are being increasingly used in some parts of the United States to determine the risk that offenders will commit other crimes. This practice has come under considerable criticism for a range of reasons. This chapter examines the persuasiveness of criticisms of sentencing algorithms, discusses the relative limitations of both human and computational decision-making, and argues that properly designed artificial intelligence systems can significantly enhance the integrity of the sentencing process. © Oxford University Press 2022.

AB  - Drawing from the theoretical underpinnings of prior work in interactive narratives to explain complexity, playable explanations, and newsgames this work aims to expand the impact and accessibility of comprehensive investigate journalism to a wide audience of North, Central and South Americans. The goal was to apply the benefits of ludic interactive narratives to explain the complexities and systemic biases in the United States immigration system for differing immigration scenarios between 2017–2021. The game combines elements of documentary games, persuasive play, and the fundamentals of interactive narrative to provide a playful explanation of explicit and implicit policy. It is, in short, an interactive system about a system. This interpretation of the system was derived not from a top-down view of the system, but by the reverse engineered understanding informed by two years of investigative journalism research informed by the data in both the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers. This paper articulates the development process, release, and subsequent observations from an experienced engaged by more than 45,000 players. This case study is understood as the first ever playful interactive based on the Panama Papers and Paradise Papers investigations. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - When it comes to persuading other people, non-verbal cues play an important role in order to be successful. Mostly, people use these non-verbal cues subconsciously and, from the perspective of the persuadee, are not aware of the subliminal impact of them. To raise awareness of subliminal persuasion, we analyzed videos of different political public speeches. We used the labels of three annotators to train three subjective neural networks capable of predicting their degree of perceived persuasiveness based on the images as input only. We then created visualizations of the predictions for each network/annotator to draw conclusions about what the annotators have most likely focused on. For that, we employed layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) that highlights the most relevant image sections for each prediction. Our results show that techniques like LRP can help uncover existing subliminal bias. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The fully autonomous vehicle (AV) promises to be both a prototypic example of deep mediatization in the built environment and the apotheosis of the mediatized automobile. Autonomy has been an elusive goal, however. Its achievement will depend on a persuasive sociotechnical imaginary (STI), along with breakthroughs in digital technology. The latter involve advanced artificial intelligence, of course, but also the transformation of the nature of media, a dynamic that goes well beyond the mere proliferation of in-car media. After exploring “media” and automotive deep mediatization, this article dwells on neglected examples of existing mobile autonomy. It then turns to STIs in general, which are visionary articulations of pioneering communities, and the American AV STI in particular. This is constructed through a close reading of recent semipopular publications that mostly promote the desirability of vehicular autonomy. The article concludes critically, with analysis of the unpersuasiveness of the current American AV STI, the vehicle in AV, and the transformation of media. © 2023 (James Miller).

AB  - The marketing, more precisely, advertising industry has always been driven by the pursuit of personalization, precise identification of target groups, attracting the right audience and attribution for the least effort with the lowest cost. In order for this technique to be successful, it requires a significant and deep knowledge of the audience. That deep knowledge relies on data science, especially in marketing areas of search engine optimization, customer engagement, responsiveness, profiling and real-time marketing campaigns. Moreover, new ways to apply data science and analytics in marketing emerge every day as we witness activities like extreme personalization, micro-targeting, micro-segmentation, and many others. And as result OOH (“out-of-home advertising”) was disregarded until recently because of its lack of ability to provide attribution or consumer data. Nevertheless, transformation from traditional out-of-home advertising to digital out-of-home (“DOOH”) advertising or any “digital media endorsing audio and video messages related to products or services outside of the home”, illustrates how the advertising industry is leveraging new technologies to continue the pursuit of personalization and customization. Our research starts with traditional OOH and expand to usage of anamorphic illusion technology, which is the art of bending images through optical illusions which rely on viewers to be standing or viewing from a specific angle to actually see or realize the full effect of the finished creative. Being able to predict where viewers will stand, based on illusion board content, our research provide methodology which brings platform for message-persuasion level enhancement by collecting anonymized data and turn them into business-driven personalized insights. Research include AI empowered platform for recognition and collection of insights from audience. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Recommender systems aim to support their users by reducing information overload so that they can make better decisions. Recommender systems must be transparent, so users can form mental models about the system’s goals, internal state, and capabilities, that are in line with their actual design. Explanations and transparent behaviour of the system should inspire trust and, ultimately, lead to more persuasive recommendations. Here, explanations convey reasons why a recommendation is given or how the system forms its recommendations. This paper focuses on the question how such claims about effectiveness of explanations can be evaluated. Accordingly, we investigate various models that are used to assess the effects of explanations and recommendations. We discuss objective and subjective measurement and argue that both are needed. We define a set of metrics for measuring the effectiveness of explanations and recommendations. The feasibility of using these metrics is discussed in the context of a specific explainable recommender system in the food and health domain. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Today’s learners are more realistic and spend most of their learning time exploring information technologies like eLearning, video-assisted learning, blockchain technology for MOOCs, artificial intelligence (AI), learning analytics, gamification, immersive learning with VR and AR, STEAM-based programmes, social media, and others to generate novice ideas. This research paper analyses the efficacy of e-portfolios to involve engineering students of BTech first year in setting, organising, comprehending, evaluating, and analysing academic writing skills through information and communication technology (ICT). The English language and communication skills lab uses a quantitative experimental research strategy that emphasises questionnaires and e-portfolios to improve participants’ writing skills (ELCS). This project studies using JNTU-related e-portfolios to create intrinsically motivating creative competency in students. E-portfolios are easily accessible and allow students to provide multimedia proof, say the researchers. Instead of writing about their accomplishments, students can submit photographs, videos, and audio recordings. This speeds up and enhances learning. Many engineering students enhanced their persuasive writing using e-portfolios. Copyright © 2023 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - This article examines the role that Criminal Law should play in regulating the non-therapeutic use of immersive Virtual Reality (VR), specifically its massive use by consumers. The starting point has been to consider VR as an intermediate risk scenario, for the purposes of Criminal Law, between the criminality entirely generated in the physical world and that developed in the 2D digital environments [cybercrimes and criminality linked to social networks and persuasive Artificial Intelligence (AI)]. Firstly, specialize literature has been analyzed to establish the nature of virtual reality. From a technical standpoint, virtual reality is a neurotechnology infused with high-risk artificial intelligence; an inseparable synthesis of non-invasive neurotechnology and a set of AI systems, considered high-risk for the fundamental rights of citizens. From the perspective of its functioning, VR is a “transformative” neurotechnology capable of altering what people perceive as reality. This is possible, because its realism lies in the emotional immersion of the user in the virtual experience, similarly to how our brain functions. Therefore, the key idea in the immersive functioning of virtual reality is its capacity to evoke and modify human emotions, which results its greater harmful potential compared to the 2D environment. From there, three central and specific areas of (legally unaddressed) risk arise: (1) the special comprehensive nature of the data collected and stored during its use; (2) its ability to mentally reproduce the “physical” experience of the avatar in the user; and (3) its significant capacity to manipulate individuals. Secondly, the paper examines both the reported cases and the foreseeable criminality in virtual worlds or “proto-metaverse,” focusing on the three risk areas, and exemplifying them with attacks on mental privacy, sexual freedom, and consumer manipulation. Finally, it is proposed that Criminal Law should also intervene (as soon as possible) to define the “red lines” of massive virtual reality use by citizens. With a democratic and human-centered approach, a basic legal framework is outlined for the criminalization of specific harms and risks associated with virtual reality, adapting the existing legal framework as necessary.

AB  - This paper presents the Interactive Behavior Change Model (IBCM 8.0), a system that integrates behavior change principles from neuroscience, psychology, and behavioral science into a behavioral meta-theory. With its broad, application-agnostic nature, the IBCM provides insight into behavior change, how it operates, and offers an alternative explanation for why various behavior change models work or do not work. It has applications as a behavioral system for education, research, analysis, intervention design, and implementation in various technologies, especially self-adaptive systems run by rule-based engines or artificial intelligence (AI). Due to space limits, this paper covers the model structure and theory with a limited high-level overview of its ontology. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

This method is aimed at mitigating the typically time-consuming task of providing feedback on argumentation documents, which often falls solely on the author’s supervisor or teacher. The proposed method divides the task argument improvement into three types of micro-tasks: (1) classifying opinions vs. facts, (2) checking that evidence is given to support the facts, and (3) checking that a rationale is given to support the opinions. These micro-tasks are allocated to the crowd workers and executed asynchronously to achieve efficient feedback generation. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Conversational artificial intelligence (chatbots and dialogue systems) is an emerging tool for tobacco cessation that has the potential to emulate personalised human support and increase engagement. We aimed to determine the effect of conversational artificial intelligence interventions with or without standard tobacco cessation interventions on tobacco cessation outcomes among adults who smoke, compared to no intervention, placebo intervention or an active comparator. Methods: A comprehensive search of six databases was completed in June 2022. Eligible studies included randomised controlled trials published since 2005. The primary outcome was sustained tobacco abstinence, self-reported and/or biochemically validated, for at least 6 months. Secondary outcomes included point-prevalence abstinence and sustained abstinence of less than 6 months. Two authors independently extracted data on cessation outcomes and completed the risk of bias assessment. Random effects meta-analysis was conducted. Results: From 819 studies, five randomised controlled trials met inclusion criteria (combined sample size n = 58,796). All studies differed in setting, methodology, intervention, participants and end-points. Interventions included chatbots embedded in multi- and single-component smartphone apps (n = 3), a social media-based (n = 1) chatbot, and an internet-based avatar (n = 1). Random effects meta-analysis of three studies found participants in the conversational artificial intelligence enhanced intervention were significantly more likely to quit smoking at 6-month follow-up compared to control group participants (RR = 1.29, 95% CI (1.13, 1.46), p < 0.001). Loss to follow up was generally high. Risk of bias was high overall. Conclusion: We found limited but promising evidence on the effectiveness of conversational artificial intelligence interventions for tobacco cessation. Although all studies found benefits from conversational artificial intelligence interventions, results should be interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity. Given the rapid evolution and potential of artificial intelligence interventions, further well-designed randomised controlled trials following standardised reporting guidelines are warranted in this emerging area. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The effective management of chronic conditions requires an approach that promotes a shift in care from the clinic to the home, improves the efficiency of health care systems, and benefits all users irrespective of their needs and preferences. Digital health can provide a solution to this challenge, and in this paper, we provide our vision for a smart health ecosystem. A smart health ecosystem leverages the interoperability of digital health technologies and advancements in big data and artificial intelligence for data collection and analysis and the provision of support. We envisage that this approach will allow a comprehensive picture of health, personalization, and tailoring of behavioral and clinical support; drive theoretical advancements; and empower people to manage their own health with support from health care professionals. We illustrate the concept with 2 use cases and discuss topics for further consideration and research, concluding with a message to encourage people with chronic conditions, their caregivers, health care professionals, policy and decision makers, and technology experts to join their efforts and work toward adopting a smart health ecosystem. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - This study investigates fact-checking effectiveness in reducing belief in misinformation across various types of fact-check sources (i.e., professional fact-checkers, mainstream news outlets, social media platforms, artificial intelligence, and crowdsourcing). We examine fact-checker credibility perceptions as a mechanism to explain variance in fact-checking effectiveness across sources, while taking individual differences into account (i.e., analytic thinking and alignment with the fact-check verdict). An experiment with 859 participants revealed few differences in effectiveness across fact-checking sources but found that sources perceived as more credible are more effective. Indeed, the data show that perceived credibility of fact-check sources mediates the relationship between exposure to fact-checking messages and their effectiveness for some source types. Moreover, fact-checker credibility moderates the effect of alignment on effectiveness, while analytic thinking is unrelated to fact-checker credibility perceptions, alignment, and effectiveness. Other theoretical contributions include extending the scope of the credibility-persuasion association and the MAIN model to the fact-checking context, and empirically verifying a critical component of the two-step motivated reasoning model of misinformation correction. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to progress, the use of AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in higher education settings has gained significant attention. This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students' ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students' ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students' ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students' ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education. The findings also provide actionable guidance for AI developers and educational institutions seeking to optimize student engagement with AI technologies. Copyright © 2024 Polyportis.

AB  - Epilepsy is a prevalent and frequently devastating neurological disorder defined by recurring spontaneous seizures caused by aberrant electrical activity in the brain. Over ten million people worldwide suffer from drug-resistant epilepsy. This severe condition requires novel treatment approaches. Both oxidative and nitrosative stress are thought to have a role in the etiology of epilepsy. Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogue that is used to treat type-2 diabetes mellitus. According to recent studies, Liraglutide also shows neuroprotective properties, improving memory retention and total hippocampus pyramidal neuronal population in mice. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the anti-seizure and anti-oxidative effects of liraglutide in a pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced rat model of epilepsy. 48 rats were randomly assigned to two groups: those who had electroencephalography (EEG) recordings and those who underwent behavioral assessment. Rats received either intraperitoneal (IP) liraglutide at two different dosages (3–6 mg/kg) or a placebo, followed by pentylenetetrazole (IP). To determine if liraglutide has anti-seizure characteristics, we examined seizure activity in rats using EEG, the Racine convulsion scale (RCS), the time of first myoclonic jerk (FMJ), and MDA, SOD, TNF-α, IL-1β and GAD-67 levels. The mean EEG spike wave percentage score was reduced from 75.8% (placebo) to 59.4% (lower-dose) and 41.5% (higher-dose). FMJ had increased from a mean of 70.6 s (placebo) to 181.2 s (lower-dose) and 205.2 s (higher-dose). RCS was reduced from a mean of 5.5 (placebo) to 2.7 (lower-dose) and 2.4 (higher-dose). Liraglutide (3 and 6 mg/kg i.p.) successfully decreased the spike percentages and RCS associated with PTZ induced epilepsy, as well as considerably decreased MDA, TNF-α, IL-1β and elevated SOD, GAD-67 levels in rat brain. Liraglutide significantly decreased seizure activity at both dosages when compared to control, most likely due to its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. The potential clinical role of liraglutide as an anti-seizure medication should be further explored. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Among myriad complex challenges facing educational institutions in this era of a rapidly evolving job marketplace is the development of career self-efficacy among students. Self-efficacy has traditionally been understood to be developed through the direct experience of competence, the vicarious experience of competence, social persuasion, and physiological cues. These four factors, and particularly the first two, are difficult to build into education and training programs in a context where changing skills make the specific meaning of graduate competence largely unknown and, notwithstanding the other contributions in this collection, largely unknowable. In response, in this paper we argue for a working metacognitive model of career self-efficacy that will prepare students with the skills needed to evaluate their skills, attitudes and values and then adapt and develop them as their career context evolves around them. The model we will present is one of evolving complex sub-systems within an emergent milieu. In identifying various contributing factors, the model provides specific cognitive and affective constructs as important targets for actionable learning analytics for career development.

AB  - This paper presents proposed solutions for addressing two subtasks in SemEval-2023 Task 3: “Detecting the Genre, the Framing, and the Persuasion techniques in online news in a multilingual setup”. In subtask 1, “News Genre Categorisation”, the goal is to classify a news article as an opinion, a report, or a satire. In subtask 3, “Detection of Persuasion Technique”, the system must reveal persuasion techniques used in each news article paragraph choosing among 23 defined methods. Solutions leverage the application of the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) method, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). In subtask 1, SHAP was used to understand what was driving the model to fail so that it could be improved accordingly. In contrast, in subtask 3, a re-calibration of the Attention Mechanism was realized by extracting critical tokens for each persuasion technique. The underlying idea is the exploitation of XAI for countering the over-fitting of the resulting model and attempting to improve the performance when there are few samples in the training data. The achieved performance on English for subtask 1 ranked 6th with an F1-score of 58.6% (despite 78.4% of the 1st) and for subtask 3 ranked 12th with a micro-averaged F1-score of 29.8% (despite 37.6% of the 1st). © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Even though blood products cannot be produced artificially, but are important for many surgeries and treatments, less than 1 % of the population donates blood in countries like South Africa or Ghana. Therefore, efficient and successful blood donor mobilisation and management are important. We argue that a chatbot offers easy access to information for all types of donors and can support the transition of non-, first-time or lapsed donors to regular donors. By applying the design science research methodology, we have developed a chatbot for all donor types in South Africa and Ghana. We performed two design cycles, collaborating with experts from three blood services and grounding our research on existing and derived behavioural change models. The chatbot was positively evaluated in two workshops that included focus group discussions and online surveys. © 2023 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2023: "Rising like a Phoenix: Emerging from the Pandemic and Reshaping Hu.

AB  - Ubiquitous devices, such as smartphones and wearables, are becoming increasingly popular for monitoring user behavior, health, and well-being. Through omnipresent monitoring, they aim to raise user awareness and encourage positive health behavior change. Yet, ubiquitous technologies suffer from expectation mismatch, lack of user-centric adaptiveness, and, ultimately, high abandonment rates. This work is motivated by the vital need to tailor and personalize ubiquitous technologies while dealing with the challenges arising from the lack of user profiling and the absence of relevant, self-reported user data. To this end, we show that the automatically passively collected sensing data from the wearables can be exploited to improve personalization and infer several user states relevant to demographic, physiological, psychological, and personality aspects, complementing the need for time-consuming self-reports. To accomplish this task, and enable the reproducibility and extensibility of our work; we propose an extensive benchmark suite by exploiting sensing data harvested from ubiquitous devices.Our benchmark covers a wide range of personalization tasks, including modeling gender, age, personality states, and stress, experimenting on the publicly available, newly released LifeSnaps dataset containing over 71 million rows of data capturing the daily lives of 71 participants in their naturalistic environments. The proposed benchmarking continuum showcases the strong potential for the applicability of the presented work in critical applications, such as mental healthcare monitoring, privacy preservation, and responsible artificial intelligence (AI), by fostering fairness assessments when protected attribute knowledge is unavailable. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are used by ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), a ground-breaking technology, to produce natural language answers to input or prompts. It has been applied in a variety of industries, including content development, customer support, and natural language processing. With the increase in the growth of AI technology, the company like OpenAI created the chatGPT prototype which is used as chatting machine. ChatGPT has several limitations even if it is wonderful and creates interesting stories, poems, songs, essays, and other writing. The bot will respond to queries from users with relevant, persuasive subjects and arguments. Here in this work, a brief introduction about chatGPT like how it came, what are the opportunities, various applications, implementing issues, and future is presented. A variety of chatGPT tools and software used is also analyzed.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Data-centric targeting with artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming advertising by using machine learning and big data to target consumers, creating value for both consumers and brands. Despite the growing interest in ethnicity targeting in social media, there is still much to learn about leveraging ethnicity data for advertising research and practice. In this study, we surveyed 1,030 Black U.S. social media users to explore their understanding of AI and data gathering related to ethnicity. We focused on ethnic affinity targeting (EAT), a controversial tactic used by social media platforms. Our results indicate that the ethical aspects of persuasion knowledge, specifically appropriateness beliefs, affect consumers’ coping strategies through distinct mechanisms. Consumers’ ethnic identification and the stability of their affinity feelings toward social media also influence intentions to use specific coping strategies. These findings suggest that consumers’ perceptions of ethnicity targeting depend on how advertisers collect and use ethnicity data and underscore the importance of diverse perspectives to inform algorithm transparency practices and policies. © 2023 American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - Although automation is not a novelty, high hopes are currently pinned on more and more ingenious devices built with Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI has become a key discussion point in the agendas of governments and multinational agencies, with particular interest in educational applications. This article explores parallels between ideas surrounding AI in education and conceptions proposed in the 17th century by Jan Amos Comenius, known as the father of modern education. Drawing upon illustrations from ongoing research that takes metaphor as its core analytical category, the piece assumes that metaphors are not mere stylistic elements, but strategic persuasive devices. Comenius’ didachography, a portmanteau coined in his 1657 Didactica Magna to describe an inclusive educational system, relies heavily on metaphors that suggest remarkable similarities with contemporary EdTech rhetoric, especially on AI-related developments. Whilst exemplifying that ideas and premises entailed in current discourses on EdTech may hark back to centuries-old ideas, the paper argues that, despite taking on varying, contextually situated linguistic expressions, underlying metaphors appear to have endured from Comenius’ time to support the advent of an educational system poised to automate teaching and, thus, dispense with a key part of his scheme: the teacher. In closing, the piece suggests that we may need to acknowledge the contingent nature of teaching and learning, perhaps accepting that key aspects of what makes us human may always resist engineering. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) applications are widely used in interactions with end users. However, there remains a lack of understanding of how the different characteristics of these systems, particularly the anthropomorphic design and the type of explanations provided interact to affect user reactions to AI. We address this research gap by building on social response theory (SRT), prior XAI and anthropomorphic design literature, to investigate how anthropomorphic design (human-like vs. machine-like) and types of explanations (consensual, expert, internal, empirical validation-based explanations) affect user reactions to AI (perceived trust and persuasiveness) and acceptance of AI systems. We will evaluate the proposed research model by conducting a 2 × 4 between-subjects experiment. This study will enrich the theoretical landscape of anthropomorphic design and human-AI interaction (HAII), offering actionable insights into user perception and acceptance for XAI practitioners.

AB  - Background: People with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID; IQ=50-85) are at risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (AUD). One factor contributing to this risk is sensitivity to peer pressure. Hence, tailored trainings are needed to practice alcohol refusal in impacted patients. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) appears promising to engage patients in dialogs with virtual humans, allowing to practice alcohol refusal realistically. However, requirements for such an IVR have not been studied for MBID/AUD. Objective: This study aims to develop an IVR alcohol refusal training for patients with MBID and AUD. In this work, we cocreated our peer pressure simulation with experienced experts in addiction care. Methods: We followed the Persuasive System Design (PSD) model to develop our IVR alcohol refusal training. With 5 experts from a Dutch addiction clinic for patients with MBID, we held 3 focus groups to design the virtual environment, persuasive virtual human(s), and persuasive dialog. Subsequently, we developed our initial IVR prototype and conducted another focus group to evaluate IVR and procedures for clinical usage, resulting in our final peer pressure simulation. Results: Our experts described visiting a friend at home with multiple friends as the most relevant peer pressure situation in the clinical setting. Based on the identified requirements, we developed a social-housing apartment with multiple virtual friends present. Moreover, we embedded a virtual man with generic appearance to exert peer pressure using a persuasive dialog. Patients can respond to persuasive attempts by selecting (refusal) responses with varying degrees of risk for relapse in alcohol use. Our evaluation showed that experts value a realistic and interactable IVR. However, experts identified lacking persuasive design elements, such as paralanguage, for our virtual human. For clinical usage, a user-centered customization is needed to prevent adverse effects. Further, interventions should be therapist delivered to avoid try-and-error in patients with MBID. Lastly, we identified factors for immersion, as well as facilitators and barriers for IVR accessibility. Conclusions: Our work establishes an initial PSD for IVR for alcohol refusal trainings in patients with MBID and AUD. With this, scholars can create comparable simulations by performing an analogous cocreation, replicate findings, and identify active PSD elements. For peer pressure, conveying emotional information in a virtual human’s voice (eg, paralanguage) seems vital. However, previous rapport building may be needed to ensure that virtual humans are perceived as cognitively capable entities. Future work should validate our PSD with patients and start developing IVR treatment protocols using interdisciplinary teams. © Simon Langener, Jan Kolkmeier, Joanne VanDerNagel, Randy Klaassen, Jeannette van Manen, Dirk Heylen.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has been applied to health behavior change research for over a decade. Current research programs include machine learning for delivering just-in-time adaptive interventions, computational modeling of behavior change processes, and the use of social AI for communication and persuasion. With new advances in AI, we propose an international workshop to bring together experts from all related disciplines to discuss and explore the potentials of AI for behavior change research. We discuss in this proposal the aims, planned activities, expected outcomes, and a promotion strategy for the workshop. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Previous research on argumentation in online discussions has largely focused on examining individual comments and neglected the interactive nature of discussions. In line with previous work, we represent individual comments as sequences of semantic argumentative unit types. However, because it is intuitively necessary for dialogical argumentation to address the opposing viewpoints, we extend this model by clustering type sequences into different argument arrangement patterns and representing discussions as sequences of these patterns. These sequences of patterns are a symbolic representation of argumentation strategies that capture the overall structure of discussions. Using this novel approach, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the strategies in 34,393 discussions from the online discussion forum Change My View and show that our discussion model is effective for persuasiveness prediction, outperforming LLM-based classifiers on the same data. Our results provide valuable insights into argumentation dynamics in online discussions and, through the presented prediction procedure, are of practical importance for writing assistance and persuasive text generation systems. © 2023 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Background: The motivational interviewing (MI) approach has been shown to help move ambivalent smokers toward the decision to quit smoking. There have been several attempts to broaden access to MI through text-based chatbots. These typically use scripted responses to client statements, but such nonspecific responses have been shown to reduce effectiveness. Recent advances in natural language processing provide a new way to create responses that are specific to a client's statements, using a generative language model. Objective: This study aimed to design, evolve, and measure the effectiveness of a chatbot system that can guide ambivalent people who smoke toward the decision to quit smoking with MI-style generative reflections. Methods: Over time, 4 different MI chatbot versions were evolved, and each version was tested with a separate group of ambivalent smokers. A total of 349 smokers were recruited through a web-based recruitment platform. The first chatbot version only asked questions without reflections on the answers. The second version asked the questions and provided reflections with an initial version of the reflection generator. The third version used an improved reflection generator, and the fourth version added extended interaction on some of the questions. Participants' readiness to quit was measured before the conversation and 1 week later using an 11-point scale that measured 3 attributes related to smoking cessation: readiness, confidence, and importance. The number of quit attempts made in the week before the conversation and the week after was surveyed; in addition, participants rated the perceived empathy of the chatbot. The main body of the conversation consists of 5 scripted questions, responses from participants, and (for 3 of the 4 versions) generated reflections. A pretrained transformer-based neural network was fine-tuned on examples of high-quality reflections to generate MI reflections. Results: The increase in average confidence using the nongenerative version was 1.0 (SD 2.0; P=.001), whereas for the 3 generative versions, the increases ranged from 1.2 to 1.3 (SD 2.0-2.3; P<.001). The extended conversation with improved generative reflections was the only version associated with a significant increase in average importance (0.7, SD 2.0; P<.001) and readiness (0.4, SD 1.7; P=.01). The enhanced reflection and extended conversations exhibited significantly better perceived empathy than the nongenerative conversation (P=.02 and P=.004, respectively). The number of quit attempts did not significantly change between the week before the conversation and the week after across all 4 conversations. Conclusions: The results suggest that generative reflections increase the impact of a conversation on readiness to quit smoking 1 week later, although a significant portion of the impact seen so far can be achieved by only asking questions without the reflections. These results support further evolution of the chatbot conversation and can serve as a basis for comparison against more advanced versions. © 2023 Berghahn Journals. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Sensors are increasingly used in health interventions to unobtrusively and continuously capture participants’ physical activity in free-living conditions. The rich granularity of sensor data offers great potential for analyzing patterns and changes in physical activity behaviors. The use of specialized machine learning and data mining techniques to detect, extract, and analyze these patterns has increased, helping to better understand how participants’ physical activity evolves. Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to identify and present the various data mining techniques employed to analyze changes in physical activity behaviors from sensors-derived data in health education and health promotion intervention studies. We addressed two main research questions: (1) What are the current techniques used for mining physical activity sensor data to detect behavior changes in health education or health promotion contexts? (2) What are the challenges and opportunities in mining physical activity sensor data for detecting physical activity behavior changes? Methods: The systematic review was performed in May 2021 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We queried the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), IEEE Xplore, ProQuest, Scopus, Web of Science, Education Resources Information Center (ERIC), and Springer literature databases for peer-reviewed references related to wearable machine learning to detect physical activity changes in health education. A total of 4388 references were initially retrieved from the databases. After removing duplicates and screening titles and abstracts, 285 references were subjected to full-text review, resulting in 19 articles included for analysis. Results: All studies used accelerometers, sometimes in combination with another sensor (37%). Data were collected over a period ranging from 4 days to 1 year (median 10 weeks) from a cohort size ranging between 10 and 11615 (median 74). Data preprocessing was mainly carried out using proprietary software, generally resulting in step counts and time spent in physical activity aggregated predominantly at the daily or minute level. The main features used as input for the data mining models were descriptive statistics of the preprocessed data. The most common data mining methods were classifiers, clusters, and decision-making algorithms, and these focused on personalization (58%) and analysis of physical activity behaviors (42%). Conclusions: Mining sensor data offers great opportunities to analyze physical activity behavior changes, build models to better detect and interpret behavior changes, and allow for personalized feedback and support for participants, especially where larger sample sizes and longer recording times are available. Exploring different data aggregation levels can help detect subtle and sustained behavior changes. However, the literature suggests that there is still work remaining to improve the transparency, explicitness, and standardization of the data preprocessing and mining processes to establish best practices and make the detection methods easier to understand, scrutinize, and reproduce. ©Claudio Diaz, Corinne Caillaud, Kalina Yacef.

AB  - Recent developments in the area of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have broadened opportunities for users to interact with various technologies. In this context, many enterprises have been shifting their priorities to offering distinctive user experiences (UX) from purely concentrating on effective production and distribution of products/applications. They believe that creating a good user experience is the key to develop efficient and persuasive products/applications. The survey in this paper considers the user experience of mobile applications. Many times mobile application users encounter bugs which may affect the functionality of applications and it is not a good user experience. This survey is based on recognizing and analyzing existing research work that outlines various approaches used for mobile GUI testing tasks to enhance user experience. It is carried out by collecting similar research publications from reputed journals and conferences from 2018 till date. To present an organized literature survey, Research Questions (RQs) are framed. Research questions provide a clear focus and direction for the review paper. They help to define the scope of review and may ensure that the review paper addresses relevant and significant aspects of the topic. To present a detailed analysis, the results of Research Questions are collated. In the end, conclusions and future work are presented. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2023.

AB  - Digital technologies are becoming a more common part of behaviour change initiatives and campaigns. However, digital solutions can themselves present risks and challenges. In this chapter, we draw on the concept of technological solutionism to consider issues and shortcomings for behaviour change campaigns. We use the case of Florence, the World Health Organization’s “virtual health worker” who is designed to help people quit smoking, to spotlight how technologies operationalise social issues; the risk of embedded biases within technological solutions; and assumptions about digital access. While Florence is very efficient and always available, the experience overlooks some of the inherently “human” aspects of tobacco cessation, even if they are non-rational or time-consuming. The chapter encourages behaviour change practitioners to think critically about technologically enabled solutions and to be mindful of issues that can be embedded within them. © 2023 World Scientific Publishing Co..

AB  - The Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are promising technologies that can help make the health system more efficient, which concurrently can be particularly useful to help maintain a high quality of life for older adults, especially in light of healthcare staff shortage. Many health issues are challenging to manage both by healthcare staff and policymakers. They have a negative impact on older adults and their families and are an economic burden to societies around the world. This situation is particularly critical for older adults, a population highly vulnerable to diseases that needs more consideration and care. It is, therefore, crucial to improve diagnostic and management as well as proposed prevention strategies to enhance the health and quality of life of older adults. In this study, we focus on detecting symptoms in early stages of diseases to prevent the deterioration of older adults' health and avoid complications. We focus on digestive and urinary system disorders [mainly the Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) and the Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS)] that are known to affect older adult populations and that are detrimental to their health and quality of life. Our proposed approach relies on unobtrusive IoT and change point detections algorithms to help follow older adults' health status daily. The approach monitors long-term behavior changes and detects possible changes in older adults' behavior suggesting early onsets or symptoms of IBS and UTI. We validated our approach with medical staff reports and IoT data collected in the residence of 16 different older adults during periods ranging from several months to a few years. Results are showing that our proposed approach can detect changes associated to symptoms of UTI and IBS, which were confirmed with observations and testimonies from the medical staff.

AB  - The Information Retrieval community has made strides in developing neural rankers, which have show strong retrieval effectiveness on large-scale gold standard datasets. The focus of existing neural rankers has primarily been on measuring the relevance of a document or passage to the user query. However, other considerations such as the convincingness of the content are not taken into account when retrieving content. We present a large gold standard dataset, referred to as CoRe, which focuses on enabling researchers to explore the integration of the concepts of convincingness and relevance to allow for the retrieval of relevant yet persuasive content. Through extensive experiments on this dataset, we report that there is a close association between convincingness and relevance that can have practical value in how convincing content are presented and retrieved in practice. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Engagement is key to interventions that achieve successful behavior change and improvements in health. There is limited literature on the application of predictive machine learning (ML) models to data from commercially available weight loss programs to predict disengagement. Such data could help participants achieve their goals. Objective: This study aimed to use explainable ML to predict the risk of member disengagement week by week over 12 weeks on a commercially available web-based weight loss program. Methods: Data were available from 59,686 adults who participated in the weight loss program between October 2014 and September 2019. Data included year of birth, sex, height, weight, motivation to join the program, use statistics (eg, weight entries, entries into the food diary, views of the menu, and program content), program type, and weight loss. Random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and logistic regression with L1 regularization models were developed and validated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. In addition, temporal validation was performed on a test cohort of 16,947 members who participated in the program between April 2018 and September 2019, and the remaining data were used for model development. Shapley values were used to identify globally relevant features and explain individual predictions. Results: The average age of the participants was 49.60 (SD 12.54) years, the average starting BMI was 32.43 (SD 6.19), and 81.46% (39,594/48,604) of the participants were female. The class distributions (active and inactive members) changed from 39,369 and 9235 in week 2 to 31,602 and 17,002 in week 12, respectively. With 10-fold-cross-validation, extreme gradient boosting models had the best predictive performance, which ranged from 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.85) to 0.93 (95% CI 0.93-0.93) for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and from 0.57 (95% CI 0.56-0.58) to 0.95 (95% CI 0.95-0.96) for area under the precision-recall curve (across 12 weeks of the program). They also presented a good calibration. Results obtained with temporal validation ranged from 0.51 to 0.95 for area under a precision-recall curve and 0.84 to 0.93 for area under the receiver operating characteristic curve across the 12 weeks. There was a considerable improvement in area under a precision-recall curve of 20% in week 3 of the program. On the basis of the computed Shapley values, the most important features for predicting disengagement in the following week were those related to the total activity on the platform and entering a weight in the previous weeks. Conclusions: This study showed the potential of applying ML predictive algorithms to help predict and understand participants’ disengagement with a web-based weight loss program. Given the association between engagement and health outcomes, these findings can prove valuable in providing better support to individuals to enhance their engagement and potentially achieve greater weight loss. ©Aida Brankovic, Gilly A Hendrie, Danielle L Baird, Sankalp Khanna.

AB  - Family caregivers of autistic children are susceptible to unconfirmed fads and false claims regarding to the efficacy of unproven interventions. This study aims to predict family caregivers’ participation and adoption of unproven interventions in online communities. Based on the Diffusion of Innovations theory, we first divided the family caregivers’ adoption process into five stages: awareness, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Social network analysis and natural language processing methods were subsequently utilised to characterise personal, environmental, and behavioural factors for predicting the formation of last three stage. The results indicated promising evidence for the application of machine learning algorithms in predicting family caregivers’ decision (AUC = 0.823), implementation (AUC = 0.887), and confirmation (AUC = 0.921). Furthermore, the results showed that factors such as social interaction, social persuasion, and modelling significantly contributed to family caregivers’ online community participation and facilitated the adoption process of unproven interventions. Family caregivers with stronger negative emotions expressed were more likely to adopt unproven interventions and recommend these interventions to other community members, thereby accelerating the diffusion of these interventions. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: Previous studies indicated that physical education programs in schools were unsuccessful to ameliorate physical activity (PA) behaviors among adolescents. This study investigated PE teachers’ perceptions of barriers and facilitators to PA and further digital exercise interventions among inactive British adolescents in secondary schools based on the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, and Behavior (COM-B) model, the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW), and Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Method: A qualitative study was conducted among 156 PE teachers in England. deductive thematic analysis approach was applied to analyze data. Results: A comprehensive perception of PE teachers revealed 21 barriers to PA among inactive adolescents in secondary schools. The study findings show that barriers exist across all categories of the COM-B model in physical opportunity (7), reflective motivation (5), social opportunity (4), psychological capability (4) and physical capability (1). The majority of these barriers were reported in previous studies as being barriers to PA from the perspective of children and adolescents. This shows that the findings are consistent with the views of children and adolescents that participated in these studies. Particular salient barriers for inactive adolescents were reported and greater insight into their experiences was highlighted. The study reported the main sources of behavior, intervention functions, policy functions, and behavior change tools that can be used for future behavior change interventions to support inactive adolescents. Conclusion: The study recommends using its findings to design interventions for inactive adolescents to achieve recommended levels of physical activity (PA). The study’s comprehensive approach and evidence-based solutions provide extensive reference points for future intervention design, informing policy and contributing to enhancing support for inactive adolescents. Further development of digital exercise interventions, including conversational artificial intelligence (AI), is suggested to engage adolescents at scale and provide personalized support to overcome multiple barriers to PA.

AB  - Populations in resource-limited communities have low health awareness, low financial literacy levels, and inadequate access to primary healthcare, leading to low adoption of preventive health behaviours, low healthcare-seeking behaviours, and poor health outcomes. Healthcare providers have limited reach and insights, limiting their ability to design relevant products for resource limited settings. Our primary preventive health intervention, called the Saathealth family health interventions, is a scaled digital offering that aims to improve knowledge levels on various health topics, nudge positive behaviour changes, and drive improved health outcomes. This case study presents our learnings and best practices in scaling these digital health interventions in resource-limited settings and maximising their impact. We scaled the Saathealth interventions to cumulatively reach >10 million users across India using a multi-pronged approach: (1) ensuring localization and cultural relevance of the health content delivered through user research; (2) disseminating content using omni-channel approaches, which involved using diverse content types and multiple digital platforms; (3) using iterative product features such as gamification and artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) predictive models; (4) using real-time analytics to adapt the user's digital experience by using interactive content to drive them towards products and services and (5) experiments with sustainability models to yield some early successes. The Saathealth family health mobile app had >25,000 downloads and the intervention reached >873,000 users in India every month through the mobile app, Facebook, and Instagram combined, from the time period of February 2022 to January 2023. We repeatedly observed videos and quizzes to be the most popular content types across all digital channels being used. Our AI-based predictive models helped improve user retention and content consumption, contributing to the sustainability of the mobile apps. In addition to reaching a high number of users across India, our scaling strategies contributed to deepened engagement and improved health-seeking behaviour. We hope these strategies help guide the sustainable and impactful scaling of mobile health interventions in other resource-limited settings. 2023 Hazra-Ganju, Dlima, Menezes, Ganju and Mer.

AB  - Artificially created characters–virtual influencers–amass millions of followers on social media and affect digital natives’ engagement and decisionmaking in remarkable ways. Guided by the Uses and Gratification (U&G) approach and the Uncanny Valley Theory, this study seeks to understand this phenomenon. By looking into followers’ engagement with virtual influencers, this study identifies and conceptualizes six primary motivations–namely, novelty, information, entertainment, surveillance, esthetics, and integration and social interaction. Furthermore, we found that most followers perceive virtual influencers as uncanny and authentically fake. However, followers also express acceptance of their staged fabrication where curated flaws and self-justification have been found to mitigate the effect of the uncanny valley. Virtual influencers are considered effective in building brand image and boosting brand awareness, but lack the persuasive ability to incite purchase intention due to a lack of authenticity, a low similarity to followers, and their weak parasocial relations with followers. These findings advance the extant literature on U&G, influencer advertising, and virtual influencers in the era of artificial intelligence; provide insights into the mitigating factors of the uncanny valley; and yield theoretical and practical implications for the efficacy of virtual influencers in advertising campaigns. © Copyright © 2022, American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence, unperceived, can acquire the user's data, find connections not visible by a human being, profile the users, and aim at persuading them, resulting in Persuasive Technology (PT). During the persuasive process, PT can use manipulation, finding and using routes to affect System 1, the primordial brain of individuals, in the absence of their awareness, undermining their decision-making processes. Multiple international and European bodies recognized that AI systems could use manipulation at an unprecedented degree via second-generation dark patterns such as the hypernudge and that computational manipulation constitutes a risk for autonomy and different, overlapping, fundamental rights such as privacy, informational self-determination and freedom of thought. However, there is a lack of shared ideas regarding which fundamental rights are violated by computational manipulation and which fundamental rights can protect individuals against it. The right to be let alone and the right to hold and express a thought differ from the right to create a thought, being in control of the decision-making process and free from cognitive interferences operated by computational manipulation. Therefore, this paper argues in favor of recognizing a newly emerged fundamental right, the right to mental self-determination, tailored to the unprecedented abilities of AI-driven manipulative technologies.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) tools have become integral to the coding workflow, facilitating productivity through auto-completion, code suggestions, and chat dialogues. More than ever, the psychological relationship between software engineers and AI partners requires further exploration, mirroring the need to understand the psychological aspects of pilot-navigator roles these tools partly simulate, as highlighted in earlier studies. [Goal] The presented research aims to investigate the programmer behavior change and psychological effects of AI-Assisted programming on professionals and undergraduates. [Methods] The authors performed a series of seven experimental programming sessions on the undergraduate student sample, subjecting them to programming in solo, pair, and AI-Assisted settings. Following the experimental sessions, five semi-structured interviews were conducted with the experimental participants from the academic realm and another five with experienced users of AI programming tools from the professional realm. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis in an essentialist way, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of the participants' experiences, feelings, and attitudes toward AI-Assisted programming. [Results] A total of ten themes were identified, half shared across the two realms, with 51 constituent codes selected from the professional and 35 from the student interview transcripts. The realm-Agnostic themes were: "Effectance", "Intrinsic Motivation", "Perceived AI Personality", "Dynamics of Human and AI Pairing,"and "Paradigm Shifts". The realm-specific themes included: "Personal Growth and Development", "Prospects", "Ethical Considerations", "Safety", and "Effects on Learning Processes". [Conclusion] The presented research illuminates the profound potential of using AI as a programming partner in simulated pilot-navigator roles in both professional and academic realms. It underscores the importance of understanding its effects on psychological well-being and human experience. Incorporating the revealed psychological aspects of human-AI interaction, its benefits, limitations, and dynamics will be pivotal for successful AI implementation and continued evolution in software engineering contexts. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Machine learning approaches for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression can substantially assist researchers and clinicians in developing effective AD preventive and treatment strategies. This study proposes a novel machine learning algorithm to predict the AD progression utilising a multi-task ensemble learning approach. Specifically, we present a novel tensor multi-task learning (MTL) algorithm based on similarity measurement of spatio-temporal variability of brain biomarkers to model AD progression. In this model, the prediction of each patient sample in the tensor is set as one task, where all tasks share a set of latent factors obtained through tensor decomposition. Furthermore, as subjects have continuous records of brain biomarker testing, the model is extended to ensemble the subjects' temporally continuous prediction results utilising a gradient boosting kernel to find more accurate predictions. We have conducted extensive experiments utilising data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and model. Results demonstrate that the proposed model have superior accuracy and stability in predicting AD progression compared to benchmarks and state-of-the-art multi-task regression methods in terms of the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) questionnaire and The Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) cognitive scores. Brain biomarker correlation information can be utilised to identify variations in individual brain structures and the model can be utilised to effectively predict the progression of AD with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and cognitive scores of AD patients at different stages.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Digital health with mHealth contributes to health promotion by empowering the user with a holistic view of their health. Proactive mHealth is to predict and prevent a situation beforehand, promptly. Most health decisions are taken by the user pervasively. They have a short or long-term impact. Being proactive requires support as ubiquitous decision-making is prone to sudden changes. Changes in users’ internal and contextual states require adaptive systems with timeliness. Personalized health information needs analysis to support user-level decision-making. The goal is to automate processes and augment healthy behaviour. Data from wearables, together with the context, requires automated decision-making with AI modelling, for predicting intervention values. Prediction and prevention mechanism in implementation requires timely interventions, triggered with a supportive action. The health information (wearables + context) can provide information about the states (current, future, and goal). AI-enabled proactive mHealth framework accentuates abstraction by presenting modules with rules of user-level decision-making, tools for automated decision-making, design with P5 principles, and the architecture of Just-in-time adaptive interventions. In this paper, a proof-of-concept (POC) for health promotion with physical activity is implemented based on the framework. The goal is to promote health with motivation. The paper also categorizes intervention with type, properties, and principles. Components of intervention and behaviour change are also listed. POC includes parameters of context and user profile. The paper provides a step-by-step approach to implementing the system on the framework, from input/output mapping to modelling. The outcome is a POC that alters and augments behaviour change for health promotion with physical activity. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Supply Chain Management is a quintessential task of every firm as it is the core of the business. A business is driven entirely by customer behaviour, change in seasonal demand and how the customer expands or shrunk their purchasing power. The stock available in the inventory should also be managed based on the changing demand, if under stocked or overstocked leads to huge losses to the business and they will also lose their market share. This work focuses on the ongoing problem in the supply chain domain, which is the Bullwhip Effect, wherein a slight change in the customer demand has a significant impact in the inventory leading to stocking more than required. Many methodologies have been incorporated to reduce the effect of Bull whip. The advancement in the field of Artificial Intelligence has rendered effective to solve various real time problems. The machine learning algorithms can be fine-tuned to predict the seasonal demand in the market in prior based on the customer behaviour. The prediction results obtained using CatBoost machine learning algorithm has proven effective as it predicts the sales with better accuracy by combining the boost-ing technique on a decision tree. © 2023, Scibulcom Ltd..

AB  - Imbalanced data poses a significant challenge in classification as model performance is affected by insufficient learning from minority classes. Balancing methods are often used to address this problem. However, such techniques can lead to problems such as overfitting or loss of information. This study addresses a more challenging aspect of balancing methods - their impact on model behavior. To capture these changes, Explainable Artificial Intelligence tools are used to compare models trained on datasets before and after balancing. In addition to the Variable Importance method, this study uses Partial Dependence and Accumulated Local Effects profiles. Real and simulated datasets are tested, and an open-source Python package edgaro is developed to facilitate this analysis. The results obtained show significant changes in model behavior due to balancing methods, which can lead to biased models toward a balanced distribution. These findings confirm that balancing analysis should go beyond model performance comparisons to achieve higher reliability of machine learning models. Therefore, we propose a new method performance gain plot for informed data balancing strategy to make an optimal selection of balancing method by analyzing the measure of change in model behavior versus performance gain. © 2023 A.

AB  - Persuasive systems motivate behaviour change using persuasive strategies (PS) which are often implemented in various ways. However, whether or not the effectiveness of PS varies depending on implementation choices is yet to be investigated via an empirical study. We conduct a large-scale study of 568 participants to investigate if and how individuals at different Stages of Change (SoC) respond to different implementations of each strategy in the same system. We also explore why the implementations motivate behaviour change using ARCS motivation model. Our results show that people’s SoC plays a significant role in the perceived effectiveness of different implementations of the same strategy and that the implementations motivate for different reasons. For instance, people at the precontemplation stage are motivated by reward strategy implemented as badges because it increases their Confidence, while people in the preparation stage prefer reward implemented as points to build their Confidence. Our work links SoC theory with motivation theory and Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model to offer practical guidelines for tailoring PS implementations to individuals to motivate behaviour change. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Argumentative persuasive technologies are technologies that use argumentation in order to persuade the persuadee to believe in something or not, which can later lead the persuadee to perform an action or not. The use of such tools opens numerous ethical considerations. In this paper, we survey the literature on persuasion that might be useful for argumentative persuasive chatbots, we cover the existing legal framework and ethical principles and we critically analyze the new proposal for a regulation on artificial intelligence of the European Commission. We also show how to use argumentation to enhance explainability and transparency of the persuasion systems. We propose to show the graphical representation of the arguments used during the persuasion to the user at the end of the dialogue, containing the relations between the arguments (attacks, supports), their origin (source), who uttered them (i.e. the machine or the human participant) and the persuasive methods employed. Our approach has several benefits. Namely, it makes the system more transparent and enhances the human understanding of the system, which is a benefit per se. Furthermore, the fact that the system is transparent increases the trust of the user, which (apart from being one of the goals of AI in general) can increase the chance that the user is persuaded by the system. Finally, the user can give a feedback on the presented arguments (e.g. how much they believe the arguments are ethical), which can be later used to improve the persuasion system. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Perception, emotions and human reactions during the use of interactive applications are important factors for the evaluation of the user experience. The optimal evaluation of applications with augmented, mixed, virtual reality concept, or those with persuasive design usually consists of a standard user experience method mix. In addition to the classic usability test, survey or observation, psychophysical methods can also be used. This paper gives hints to help choosing the optimal measurement method mix for evaluation in giving a short description on 5 electro graphic methods. It compares the electro graphic methods electrooculography (EOG) and electroencephalography (EEG) and shows pros, cons, technical details and knowledge to perform the procedures. Both methods are combinable and can give a more detailed view in human reactions. The idea behind the study was to analyze and interpret typical user reactions. One insight learned during the development of the research design was the missing literature with specific EEG atlas for user experience context. Therefore, we show result cases out of the study and discuss the idea to simplify analysis and interpretation of data with a specified user EEG atlas and an image based artificial intelligence algorithm we will work on in future. © ICWI 2023.All rights reserved.

AB  - The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced a spectrum of generative AI services that promise to enhance various professional and personal tasks. This study aims to explore the factors influencing users' intentions to transition from basic to premium generative AI services, focusing on Performance Expectancy (PE), Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), Personal Innovativeness (PI), and Social Influence (SI). A survey of 193 individuals, primarily university students with an IT background, revealed that PE, TSE, and SI significantly affect the Behavioral Intention (BI) to adopt enhanced services, with SI being the most influential. Contrary to expectations, PI did not predict BI, indicating that innovation alone does not drive the adoption of advanced AI capabilities. The findings suggest that the practicality of AI tools, user confidence in their technical skills, and the persuasive power of social networks are pivotal in the decision-making process for upgrading AI services. This research contributes to the understanding of AI adoption patterns and provides insights for developers and marketers to tailor user experiences and educational initiatives that align with user needs and social dynamics. It also underscores the importance of addressing ethical considerations as AI continues to permeate various aspects of society.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we describe our approach to address the challenges of tailoring and personalizing behavior change recommendations based on energy consumption data collected through smart meters and energy monitoring technologies. The approach uses time-series clustering techniques with dynamic time warping to group daily energy consumption curves into similar clusters, and then provides personalized recommendations for shifting energy behavior to each individual based on their predicted consumption pattern, the day-ahead energy prices and the resulting savings opportunities. The paper presents the methodology and discusses the suitability of this approach for improving traditional energy feedback and demand response interventions, and provides an outlook on the possibilities of artificial intelligence methods to further improve the concept. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Recognising that there is a growing trend of misfits between a firm’s technology/routines and market customer needs due to the exponential technological change and linear-type needs evolution in the age of AI (artificial intelligence), this paper aims at developing a model/theory/paradigm that guarantees to attain the targeted outcome. It firstly draws the necessary conditions of BM/BMI from the natures of AI regime according to which literature review on BM/BMI is done and selects direct causal mechanisms of profit (DCMP) & business model schema (BMS) as the theoretical foundation, classifies all probable circumstances into several contingency settings in terms of environmental changes, technological change, needs evolution and bargaining power, specifies strategic indicators including normative business model (NBM) by contingency setting based on DCMP & BMS, builds the comprehensive unified paradigm (CUP) that introduces new strategising logic ‘Seek NBM first & then Get-to-It’ through new decision-making mode ‘adaptising’ with practical rationality, discusses about some vague/dubious notions in strategising, and concludes that CUP works as the general theory of BMI for it holds the universal and contingency rules for BMI simultaneously, asserting that when it comes to BM/BMI, there is nothing more robust, persuasive and practical than the general theory of BMI, CUP. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Background: The UN's High Commissioner's request for a moratorium on the use and adoption of specific Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems that pose serious risk to human rights, this commentary explores the current environment and future implications of using third-party wearable technologies in research for participants’ data privacy and data security. While wearables have been identified as tools for improving users’ physical and mental health and wellbeing by providing users with more personalized data and tailored interventions, the use of this technology does not come without concern. Objective: Primarily, as researchers, we are concerned with enmeshment of corporate and research interests and what this can mean for participant data. Methods: By drawing on specific sections of the UN Report ‘The right to privacy in the digital age’, we discuss the conflicts between corporate and research agendas and point out the current and future implications of the involvement of third-party companies for participant data privacy, data security and data usage. Finally, we offer suggestions for researchers and third-party wearable developers for conducting ethical and transparent research with wearable tech. Conclusion: We propose that this commentary be used as a foothold for further discussions about the ethical implications of using third-party wearable tech in research. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Marketing communicators are utilizing artificial intelligence–driven technology to create seemingly real communications featuring synthetic humans. This research aims to determine the consequences of disclosing the use of synthetic, or “deepfake,” video avatars in marketing. Based on schema congruity theory and the persuasion knowledge model, this research investigates whether disclosing an avatar as synthetic impacts consumers’ perceptions of source credibility and subsequent purchase intention. It also examines the role of social cynicism on consumers’ perceptions of source credibility and purchase intention. This study employs a posttest only, control group experimental design (n = 318) with participants from the United States (low social cynicism) and India (high social cynicism). Using partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis, findings indicate that disclosure of a synthetic avatar negatively impacted purchase intention due to reduced perceptions of source trustworthiness. Results show that for women and higher-income individuals, disclosure has a greater negative effect on purchase intention. However, there was no significant support for social cynicism moderating the mediation effects of the three dimensions of source credibility on purchase intention. Discussion includes implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers interested in synthetic human avatar use in marketing communications. © 2023 American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - According to the World Health Organization (WHO), adherence is considered “the extent to which a person’s behaviour – taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider”. Adherence rates average 50% in countries such as the United States, exerting important pressure on health systems. Factors which influence medication adherence can be related to the patient, the clinical conditions, therapy, socioeconomic factors and the healthcare system. Methods of adherence assessment are direct and indirect. While direct methods measure a certain drug or metabolite in body fluids of patients, indirect methods refer to self-report measures, pill count, electronic monitoring devices, electronic databases. The continuous growth of worldwide mobile phone use makes mHealth an important tool for both evaluating as well as improving adherence. © 2023, Romanian Society for Pharmaceutical Sciences.

AB  - This paper describes developments in the fields of asthma and COPD self-management interventions (SMIs) over the last two decades and discusses future directions. Evidence around SMIs has exponentially grown. Efficacy on group level is convincing and both asthma and COPD SMIs are currently recommended by respiratory guidelines. Core components of asthma SMIs are defined as education, action plans, and regular review, with some discussion about self-monitoring. Exacerbation action plans are defined as an integral part of COPD management. Patient’s adherence to SMI’s is however inadequate and significantly reducing the intervention’s impact. Adherence could be improved by tailoring of SMIs to patients’ needs, health beliefs, and capabilities; the use of shared decision making; and optimising the communication between patients and health care providers. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health innovations have rapidly been introduced and expanded. Digital technology use may increase efficiency, flexibility, and efficacy of SMIs. Furthermore, artificial intelligence can be used to e.g., predict exacerbations in action plans. Research around digital health innovations to ensure evidence-based practice is of utmost importance. Current implementation of respiratory SMIs is not satisfactory. Implementation research should be used to generate further insights, with cost-effectiveness, policy (makers), and funding being significant determinants. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background Using reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions as a test case, this study aimed to develop and evaluate machine learning (ML) algorithms for extracting information from study reports and predicting outcomes as part of the Human Behaviour-Change Project. It is the first of two linked papers, with the second paper reporting on further development of a prediction system. Methods Researchers manually annotated 70 items of information (‘entities’) in 512 reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions covering intervention content and delivery, population, setting, outcome and study methodology using the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology. These entities were used to train ML algorithms to extract the information automatically. The information extraction ML algorithm involved a named-entity recognition system using the ‘FLAIR’ framework. The manually annotated intervention, population, setting and study entities were used to develop a deep-learning algorithm using multiple layers of long-short-term-memory (LSTM) components to predict smoking cessation outcomes. Results The F1 evaluation score, derived from the false positive and false negative rates (range 0–1), for the information extraction algorithm averaged 0.42 across different types of entity (SD=0.22, range 0.05–0.88) compared with an average human annotator’s score of 0.75 (SD=0.15, range 0.38–1.00). The algorithm for assigning entities to study arms (e.g., intervention or control) was not successful. This initial ML outcome prediction algorithm did not outperform prediction based just on the mean outcome value or a linear regression model. Conclusions While some success was achieved in using ML to extract information from reports of randomised trials of smoking cessation interventions, we identified major challenges that could be addressed by greater standardisation in the way that studies are reported. Outcome prediction from smoking cessation studies may benefit from development of novel algorithms, e.g., using ontological information to inform ML (as reported in the linked paper  3).

AB  - In life science and medicine, we have been conducting research using laboratory animals such as mice, rats and monkeys. However, it is impossible for humans to fully understand the feelings and conditions of experimental animals with whom we cannot communicate. In particular, investigators have recently focused on brain function and have created animal models to mimic human depression, pain, and dementia through behavioral tests such as tail suspension and mazes. These methods allow for some evaluation of the animal’s condition. However, we cannot detect trivial behavioral changes that reflect the state of mind and body of the animals reproducibly and objectively. With improvements in imaging and information processing technology, it is now possible to photograph animals for extended periods of time and perform sophisticated analysis. Artificial intelligence (AI) can also perform learning and inference, or intelligent work (machine learning), for extended periods of time by processing higher levels of information and can find interpretations that humans are unaware of. To bring innovation to life science research using animals, it is necessary to integrate and utilize these technologies to digitize and extensively and deeply evaluate biological information and emotions of experimental animals. We have been developing some basic technologies for experimental animals by applying image analysis technology, AI, and mathematical analysis. In this review, we introduce the technologies we have developed, including the latest reports. © 2023, Japanese Pharmacological Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter argues that social media robots, more commonly known as “bots,” are becoming a formative tool of online radicalization. Besides pushing targeted and personalized content perceived by users as more persuasive, algorithmic innovations in “affect recognition” have given artificially intelligent agents the ability to exploit the emotional state of social media users. On encrypted social media channels, such social media bots are especially useful to extremist groups which lack human and financial resources to enact large-scale psychological warfare campaigns. As newer generations of social bots grow their ability to read and respond to human emotions and, in turn, increase their anthropomorphic tendencies, we argue that these automated headhunters will play a dominant role in online radicalization. This chapter undertakes a qualitative study of the affective role of conversational AI in establishing an emotional relationship with potential recruits in online radicalization. We also assess current efforts by Western security agencies, social media companies, and academic researchers to counter online radicalization strategies by extremist organizations. Our chapter points to the need of greater cross-platform multi-disciplinary research, study of bots that operate in foreign languages, and detection of extremist content in multimodal forms such as memes, music, videos, and selfies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.

AB  - Olfactory dysfunction is a complication arising from various factors, including neurodegenerative disorders, aging, and viral infections like COVID-19. It can adversely affect appetite and food enjoyment, potentially leading to malnutrition. Food tailored to the sensory preferences of such patients can be an effective intervention. However, the utilization of artificial intelligence for suggesting suitable food and persuasive designs for presenting such suggestions has yet to be researched in this context. To address this gap, we conducted a co-creation workshop with patients and multidisciplinary experts to identify food-related goals and challenges faced in daily contexts. The emerging solutions are personalized food recommendations, flavor enhancements, and food sensory descriptors. However, the current databases and models are not suitable for producing these solutions. This is due to the complex feature set required to produce such recommendations. Moreover, such a system needs to incorporate factors such as health, enjoyment, and practical limitations to provide adequate support. Therefore, we outline a research roadmap toward providing personalized and persuasive artificial intelligence for people with olfactory dysfunction. © 2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Moral courage has rarely been the focus of persuasive technologies. So far, few insights on persuasive strategies for moral courage exist, which mainly target a social psychological perspective but do not address game-based specifics. Against this background, we conducted an experimental study to identify game-related persuasive strategies. We show that the players’ experience of relatedness, i.e., social belonging and interactions with fictitious characters or other players, is key for enabling courageous altruistic behavior change, namely moral and civil courage, but not other forms of altruistic behavior, such as help-giving. We present large to medium effect sizes with an increase in the relationship between moral courage and relatedness over time. We conclude that persuasive technologies for moral courage require specific persuasion strategies. By addressing relatedness, users can negotiate social norms in a reciprocal relationship with the technology, and future persuasive games could contribute to increased moral courage and, thus, social justice. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - To investigate how the interaction effects of dispositional and regional factors affect the susceptibility to persuasive strategies, we conducted a large-scale online survey (n = 3,116 in eight major cities in Japan). Our results indicate that (1) the association between the persuasiveness of persuasive strategies and personality types varies across regions, but (2) the different distributions of personality types among regions could not completely account for the regional variations. Based on our findings, as well as insights from previous studies, we propose a framework demonstrating how regional factors affect personality and the susceptibility to persuasive strategies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

With the growth of the cryptocurrency market and obscurity around it, a new form of scam, namely "Collusion Scam" has emerged as a dominant force within YouTube's comment space. Unlike typical scams and spams, collusion scams employ a cunning persuasion strategy, using the facade of genuine social interactions within comment threads to create an aura of trust and success to entrap innocent users. In this research, we collect 1,174 such collusion scam threads and perform a detailed analysis, which is tailored towards the successful detection of these scams. We find that utilization of the collusion dynamics can provide an accuracy of 96.67% and an F1-score of 93.04%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictive power of metadata associated with these threads and user channels, which act as compelling indicators of collusion scams. Finally, we show that modern LLM, like chatGPT, can effectively detect collusion scams without the need for any training. © 2023 Incoma Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chronic diseases are persistent health conditions that affect our quality of life, increase morbidity and mortality, and are a global challenge. Further, the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases requires the development of new methods for the early detection of these disease-specific biomarkers. Here, we provide a concise review of the chronic disease biomarkers acquired by electrochemical sensors. Then, we discuss the potential of artificial neural networks on the sensed data for disease monitoring and management. Next, we describe risk factors, causes, pathophysiological processes, and severity of chronic diseases. This is followed with a careful review of how we can use the sensed chronic disease biomarkers and clinical symptoms as features for the machine learning algorithms. Finally, we discuss how uncovered patterns in the biosensors’ data using artificial neural networks can be used to predict and diagnose chronic diseases. We believe this review will help in developing artificial neural network-based innovative analytical tools for chronic diseases and other healthcare applications in future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Regular physical activity (PA), healthy habits, and an appropriate diet are recommended guidelines to maintain a healthy lifestyle. A healthy lifestyle can help to avoid chronic diseases and long-term illnesses. A monitoring and automatic personalized lifestyle recommendation system (i.e., automatic electronic coach or eCoach) with considering clinical and ethical guidelines, individual health status, condition, and preferences may successfully help participants to follow recommendations to maintain a healthy lifestyle. As a prerequisite for the prototype design of such a helpful eCoach system, it is essential to involve the end-users and subject-matter experts throughout the iterative design process. Methods: We used an iterative user-centered design (UCD) approach to understend context of use and to collect qualitative data to develop a roadmap for self-management with eCoaching. We involved researchers, non-technical and technical, health professionals, subject-matter experts, and potential end-users in design process. We designed and developed the eCoach prototype in two stages, adopting different phases of the iterative design process. In design workshop 1, we focused on identifying end-users, understanding the user’s context, specifying user requirements, designing and developing an initial low-fidelity eCoach prototype. In design workshop 2, we focused on maturing the low-fidelity solution design and development for the visualization of continuous and discrete data, artificial intelligence (AI)-based interval forecasting, personalized recommendations, and activity goals. Results: The iterative design process helped to develop a working prototype of eCoach system that meets end-user’s requirements and expectations towards an effective recommendation visualization, considering diversity in culture, quality of life, and human values. The design provides an early version of the solution, consisting of wearable technology, a mobile app following the “Google Material Design” guidelines, and web content for self-monitoring, goal setting, and lifestyle recommendations in an engaging manner between the eCoach app and end-users. Conclusions: The adopted iterative design process brings in a design focus on the user and their needs at each phase. Throughout the design process, users have been involved at the heart of the design to create a working research prototype to improve the fit between technology, end-user, and researchers. Furthermore, we performed a technological readiness study of ProHealth eCoach against standard levels set by European Union (EU). © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Currently, there is a surge of interest in fair Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research which aims to mitigate discriminatory bias in AI algorithms, e.g. along lines of gender, age, and race. While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when human- fair-AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer and more accurate college major recommendations. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that the perceived gender disparity associated with a college major is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, our results demonstrate we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. They also highlight the urgent need to extend the current scope of fair AI research from narrowly focusing on debiasing AI algorithms to including new persuasion and bias explanation technologies in order to achieve intended societal impacts.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized user experience with objects. Things can perform social roles and convey persuasive messages to users, posing an important research question for communication and human-computer interaction researchers: What are the factors and underlying mechanisms that shape persuasive effects of IoT? Bridging the reactance theory and the computers are social actors paradigm, this study focuses on how power dynamics are shaped in human-IoT interactions and its implications on persuasion. Specifically, the study examines the effects of the social role assigned to the IoT mobile app agent and the scope of IoT controlled by the app on users’ perceived power and subsequent persuasive outcomes. The results reveal that when the mobile IoT app is for controlling a smart home, the servant (vs. companion) agent elicits greater perceived power over IoT for users, leading to less threat-to-freedom and better persuasive outcomes, including attitude, intention, and actual behavior. However, such a difference is not observed when the mobile app is for controlling a single smart device (i.e., smart fridge). The study findings offer valuable implications for communication practitioners interested in using IoT as a persuasive tool. Copyright © 2022 Kang, Kim and Wang.

AB  - We developed a virtual agent that motivates church-going users to change their health behavior by telling existing cultural narratives that have high relevance with the counseling topic in an engaging way. We evaluated this agent in a between-subjects experiment where participants interacted with an agent that counseled them on nutrition either without a story, with a story but told in a neutral speech style, or with a story using dramatic delivery inspired by church sermons. We found that interaction with either one of the storytelling agents leads to a significantly greater change in confidence to engage in the target behavior of healthy eating than interacting with a non-storytelling agent, demonstrating the efficacy of stories in health counseling by virtual agents.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Digital interventions for increasing physical activity behavior have shown great potential, especially those with social media. Chatbots, also known as conversational agents, have emerged in healthcare in relation to digital interventions and have proven effective in promoting physical activity among adults. The study’s objective is to explore users’ experiences with a social media chatbot. The concept and the prototype development of the social media chatbot MYA were realized in three steps: requirement analysis, concept development, and implementation. MYA’s design includes behavior change techniques effective in increasing physical activity through digital interventions. Participants in a usability study answered a survey with the Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ), which is comparable to the Systems Usability Scale. The mean CUQ score was below 68, the benchmark for average usability. The highest mean CUQ score was 64.5 for participants who thought MYA could help increase their physical activity behavior. The lowest mean CUQ score was 40.6 for participants aged between 50 and 69 years. Generally, MYA was considered to be welcoming, very easy to use, realistic, engaging, and informative. However, some technical issues were identified. A good and diversified user experience promotes prolonged chatbot use. Addressing identified issues will enhance users’ interaction with MYA. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases, specifically eosinophilic gastritis and duodenitis, are chronic inflammatory conditions characterized by persistent gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms and elevated levels of activated eosinophils in the GI tract. Both clinical and endoscopic findings are nonspecific, no clinical or histopathologic diagnostic guidelines are published, and disease awareness is low, both among clinicians and amongst pathologists, who tend to overlook mild or moderate increases in the density of eosinophils in GI biopsy specimens. Yet, evaluating and, at times, counting eosinophils in GI biopsies may have important clinical implications: the numbers of tissue eosinophils correlate with clinical manifestations, can be used as determinants of effective management, and are used to assess the effects of treatment. A most persuasive argument for providing a count rather than a value judgment is that patients read reports, understand numbers, and use them to help to understand the course of their disease. The objective of this primer is to provide pathologists with the tools to incorporate a quantitative assessment of eosinophilia in the diagnosis of gastric and duodenal biopsy specimens and to develop a systematic approach to their evaluation, counting, and reporting. To achieve this aim, we present our general approach to the biopsy (where to count), followed by details on the characteristics of a countable eosinophil (what to count), and provide with a set of suggestions on the counting methods (how to count). We conclude with suggestions on how to report GI tissue eosinophilia in a manner that alerts clinicians and prompts pertinent management steps.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) has profound implications for both communication and persuasion. We consider how AI complicates and promotes rethinking of persuasion theory and research. We define AI-based persuasion as a symbolic process in which a communicative-AI entity generates, augments, or modifies a message-designed to convince people to shape, reinforce, or change their responses-that is transmitted to human receivers. We review theoretical perspectives useful for studying AI-based persuasion-the Computers Are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, the Modality, Agency, Interactivity, and Navigability (MAIN) model, and the heuristic-systematic model of persuasion-to explicate how differences in AI complicate persuasion in two ways. First, thin AI exhibits few (if any) machinic (i.e., AI) cues, social cues might be available, and communication is limited and indirect. Second, thick AI exhibits ample machinic and social cues, AI presence is obvious, and communication is direct and interactive. We suggest avenues for future research in each case. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of International Communication Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of prediabetes and diabetes in the United States poses a serious threat to the health of the population. Closely associated with obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cardiovascular disease, a diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes carries with it life-altering demands. Critically important among these is the requirement for frequent glucose level checks - typically performed with blood obtained from a fingerstick. Innovative real-time continuous glucose monitoring (rtCGM) technology makes it possible for patients and their clinicians to receive continuous glucose level measurements around the clock without finger sticks. Accruing evidence shows that rtCGM is an effective tool for patients and their clinicians in managing diabetes (ie, maintaining glucose levels within the recommended target range) and in understanding how lifestyle behaviors directly influence glucose levels. In recent years, a number of large payer organizations (eg, private health insurers, employers) have incorporated rtCGM in their diabetes management programs as a means of addressing the dual challenge of achieving/maintaining control of glucose levels and preventing or delaying the onset of complications. Programmatic integrated approaches have been used successfully and cost-effectively for managing other chronic conditions. Incorporating rtCGM in similar integrated approaches in diabetes management may be of value in improving quality outcomes and reducing costs on a population level. The evidence supports broader adoption and continued study to evaluate models that incorporate the use of rtCGM.  Copyright © 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - We study a dynamic model of Bayesian persuasion in sequential decision-making settings. An informed principal observes an external parameter of the world and advises an uninformed agent about actions to take over time. The agent takes actions in each time step based on the current state, the principal's advice/signal, and beliefs about the external parameter. The action of the agent updates the state according to a stochastic process. The model arises naturally in many applications, e.g., an app (the principal) can advice the user (the agent) on possible choices between actions based on additional real-time information the app has. We study the problem of designing a signaling strategy from the principal's point of view. We show that the principal has an optimal strategy against a myopic agent, who only optimizes their rewards locally, and the optimal strategy can be computed in polynomial time. In contrast, it is NP-hard to approximate an optimal policy against a far-sighted agent. Further, if the principal has the power to threaten the agent by not providing future signals, then we can efficiently compute a threat-based strategy. This strategy guarantees the principal's payoff as if playing against an agent who is far-sighted but myopic to future signals. © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Purpose: The importance of artificial intelligence in human resource management has grown substantially. Previous literature discusses the advantages of AI implementation at a workplace and its various consequences, often hostile, for employees. However, there is little empirical research on the topic. The authors address this gap by studying if individuals oppose biased algorithm recommendations regarding disciplinary actions in an organisation. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted an exploratory experiment in which the authors evaluated 76 subjects over a set of 5 scenarios in which a biased algorithm gave strict recommendations regarding disciplinary actions at a workplace. Findings: The authors’ results suggest that biased suggestions from intelligent agents can influence individuals who make disciplinary decisions. Social implications: The authors’ results contribute to the ongoing debate on applying AI solutions to HR problems. The authors demonstrate that biased algorithms may substantially change how employees are treated and show that human conformity towards intelligent decision support systems is broader than expected. Originality/value: The authors’ paper is among the first to show that people may accept recommendations that provoke moral dilemmas, bring adverse outcomes, or harm employees. The authors introduce the problem of “algorithmic conformism” and discuss its consequences for HRM. © 2022, Marcin Lukasz Bartosiak and Artur Modlinski.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) systems to generate images from natural language are a game changer in graphic design. However, in visual persuasive communication, the image is not just a drawing, but is the message itself. It arises from the need for understanding how AI systems could be adopted in the design of visual communication. Thus, this article presents a model that describes the theoretical–methodological factors present in the design of persuasive visual discourses, which arises from a qualitative study with an analysis of grounded theory from the opinion of experts in the essential areas for visual communication. Thus, we propose a model to guide the design process of persuasive messages throughout seven stages. Additionally, an analysis for contributing to the orderly and informed incorporation of technologies, techniques, and methods relevant to each stage is presented. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led public health departments to issue several orders and recommendations to reduce COVID-19-related morbidity and mortality. However, for various reasons, including lack of ability to sufficiently monitor and influence behavior change, adherence to these health orders and recommendations has been suboptimal. Starting April 29, 2020, during the initial stay-at-home orders issued by various state governors, we conducted an intervention that sent online website and mobile application advertisements to people's mobile phones to encourage them to adhere to stay-at-home orders. Adherence to stay-at-home orders was monitored using individual-level cell phone mobility data, from April 29, 2020 through May 10, 2020. Mobile devices across 5 regions in the United States were randomly-assigned to either receive advertisements from our research team advising them to stay at home to stay safe (intervention group) or standard advertisements from other advertisers (control group). Compared to control group devices that received only standard corporate advertisements (i.e., did not receive public health advertisements to stay at home), the (intervention group) devices that received public health advertisements to stay at home demonstrated objectively-measured increased adherence to stay at home (i.e., smaller radius of gyration, average travel distance, and larger stay-at-home ratios). Results suggest that 1) it is feasible to use mobility data to assess efficacy of an online advertising intervention, and 2) online advertisements are a potentially effective method for increasing adherence to government/public health stay-at-home orders. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - To counter the fake news phenomenon, the scholarly community has attempted to debunk and prebunk disinformation. However, misinformation still constitutes a major challenge due to the variety of misleading techniques and their continuous updates which call for the exercise of critical thinking to build resilience. In this study we present two open access chatbots, the Fake News Immunity Chatbot and the Vaccinating News Chatbot, which combine Fallacy Theory and Human–Computer Interaction to inoculate citizens and communication gatekeepers against misinformation. These chatbots differ from existing tools both in function and form. First, they target misinformation and enhance the identification of fallacious arguments; and second, they are multiagent and leverage discourse theories of persuasion in their conversational design. After having described both their backend and their frontend design, we report on the evaluation of the user interface and impact on users’ critical thinking skills through a questionnaire, a crowdsourced survey, and a pilot qualitative experiment. The results shed light on the best practices to design user-friendly active inoculation tools and reveal that the two chatbots are perceived as increasing critical thinking skills in the current misinformation ecosystem. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Conversational Interfaces for user assistance are becoming persuasive. Today, though, most chatbots are not integrated into the application in which they are placed, but only superimposed, with no communication between the conversational and the graphical interface. We propose Multi-modal Conversational Troubleshooting Kit (MCTK), a Python package to easily integrate a conversational agent for troubleshooting in web applications. MCTK is multi-modal: once the system recognizes the problem the user is encountering, the textual solution in the chat is coupled with visual hints in the GUI. On top of that, MCTK is easy to configure and offers separation of concerns: dialogue designers can work on the conversation without the necessity of modifying the code, and vice versa. © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Researchers have underlined the need for a better understanding of the variables that contribute to and undermine the process of fake reviews detection, to help business, government, and non-profit organizations design more effective strategies (Grazioli & Jarvenpaa, 2000; Xiao & Benbasat, 2011). The purpose of this paper is to offer a comprehensive literature review on the role that AI-based technology plays in the creation, diffusion, as well as detection of fake online consumer reviews, and to propose a theoretical framework for future research. There is a developing literature on digital deception detection based on artificially intelligent tools, including machine learning and automated deception classifiers in analyzing textual and contextual indicators of manipulation (Anderson & Simester, 2014; Munzel, 2015). In this context, artificial intelligence represents a resource to automate business processes in online targeting, engaging consumers, as well as gain insights from data, analyzing numbers, text, voice, faces, and images (Davenport & Ronanki, 2018; Grewal et al., 2020; Shankar, 2018; Wirth, 2018; Yadav & Pavlou, 2020). AI agents have the potential to be successfully employed by both consumers and marketers in the process of spreading and detecting deceptive reviews, through technologies like social bots and machine learning algorithms that can make the process of manipulation more effective but can also help in its detection. Drawing from the theoretical framework based on the Persuasion Knowledge Model (Campbell & Kirmani, 2000; DeCarlo, 2005; Friestad & Wright, 1994) and the sinister attribution error in consumer judgments (Kramer, 1998; Main et al., 2007), we are proposing a framework for future research that focuses on both the intervention of AI-agents in the fake review process, as well as the changing equilibrium in consumer and business outcomes as a result of fake review use. This framework synthesizes the process of diffusing fake online reviews and their impact on consumers and organizations. This paper represents the first attempt to provide an extensive and critical review on the topic of AI-based manipulation and detection. A systematic review of the literature helps us advance our current knowledge of online reviews in several impactful ways. (1) It helps us identify AI-agents manipulation and detection mechanisms applied to understand deceptive online reviews, (2) It allows us to shed light on the unique characteristics of online reviews that allow for its manipulation and detection, and (3) it gives the ability to study the inter-relationship of literature themes using PKM to propose a direction for future research. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mobile applications are increasingly used in healthcare. We have developed a smartphone healthcare application, CALO mama Plus, that can register daily diet, exercise, mood, and sleep quality, calculate dietary intake, and provide advice using artificial intelligence technology. This 3-month randomized controlled trial tested the hypothesis that CALO mama Plus could promote body weight reduction in Japanese adults with overweight or obesity. We recruited office workers as participants. The key eligibility criteria were an age of 20–65 years and a body mass index of 23–40 kg/m2. The primary outcome was body weight change over 3 months. We enrolled 141 participants and randomly assigned them to the intervention (n = 72) and control (n = 69) groups. The intervention group used CALO mama Plus, and the control group did not receive any intervention. The change in body weight was −2.4 ± 4.0 kg and −0.7 ± 3.3 kg in the intervention and control groups, respectively. An analysis of covariance adjusted for related variables showed a significant between-group difference in body weight change (−1.60 kg; 95% confidence interval −2.83 to −0.38; p = 0.011). The present study suggests that CALO mama Plus effectively promotes weight loss. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Despite health behavioral change interventions targeting modifiable lifestyle factors underlying chronic diseases, dropouts and nonadherence of individuals have remained high. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) in recent years, alongside its ability to provide readily available personalized experience for users, holds much potential for success in health promotion and behavioral change interventions. Objective: The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing research on ML applications and harness their potential in health promotion and behavioral change interventions. Methods: A scoping review was conducted based on the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. A total of 9 databases (the Cochrane Library, CINAHL, Embase, Ovid, ProQuest, PsycInfo, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) were searched from inception to February 2021, without limits on the dates and types of publications. Studies were included in the review if they had incorporated ML in any health promotion or behavioral change interventions, had studied at least one group of participants, and had been published in English. Publication-related information (author, year, aim, and findings), area of health promotion, user data analyzed, type of ML used, challenges encountered, and future research were extracted from each study. Results: A total of 29 articles were included in this review. Three themes were generated, which are as follows: (1) enablers, which is the adoption of information technology for optimizing systemic operation; (2) challenges, which comprises the various hurdles and limitations presented in the articles; and (3) future directions, which explores prospective strategies in health promotion through ML. Conclusions: The challenges pertained to not only the time- and resource-consuming nature of ML-based applications, but also the burden on users for data input and the degree of personalization. Future works may consider designs that correspondingly mitigate these challenges in areas that receive limited attention, such as smoking and mental health. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is twofold: first to demonstrate the application of an algorithm using contextual data to ascertain consumer personality traits; and second to explore the factors impacting the relationship between personality traits and advertisement persuasiveness. Design/methodology/approach: A mixed-method approach that comprises two distinct yet complementary studies. The first uses quantitative methods and is based on a sample of 35,264 retail banking customers. Study 2 explores the findings that emerge from Study 1 using qualitative methods. Findings: This paper finds that matching consumer personality with congruent advertising messages can lead to more effective consumer persuasion for most personality types. For consumers who exhibit neurotic personality traits, ameliorating perceived risks during purchasing and providing cues for social acceptance and goal attainment are important factors for advertising effectiveness. These factors also had a positive impact on the purchasing behaviour of extroverted consumers. Research limitations/implications: This research focusses on understanding purchasing behaviour based on the most dominant personality trait. However, people are likely to exhibit a combination of most or even all of the Big Five personality traits. Practical implications: Building on advances in natural language processing, enabling the identification of personality from language, this study demonstrates the possibility of influencing consumer behaviour by matching machine inferred personality to congruent persuasive advertising. It is one of the few studies to use contextual instead of social media data to capture individual personality. Such data serves to capture an authentic rather than contrived persona. Further, the study identifies the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation of why some personality traits exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory. Originality/value: Although the idea that people are more likely to be responsive to advertising messages that are congruent with their personality type has already been successfully applied by advertising practitioners and documented by advertising scholars, this study extends existing research by identifying the factors that may moderate this relationship and thereby provides an explanation why some personality traits may exhibit differences in purchasing behaviour from those that are anticipated by existing theory. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The primary goal of utilizing chatbots for customer service is to fulfill customer requests without requiring a conversation. However, the challenge to the sustainable adoption of innovations is overcoming the obstacles that prevent the innovation's spread. The current study examined factors including consumers' perceptions, barriers and perceived risks that influence consumers' intentions to continue utilizing chatbot services in community enterprise. Modeling integrates the innovation-decision process in Phase 1 (knowledge, persuasion, and decision) with the technology acceptance model (TAM), perceived convenience and information quality. We also consider technological anxiety and openness to experience as potential barriers to individual innovation. The research model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) from 401 users with no more than 6 months of community-enterprise chatbot experience. Key findings that perceived privacy and time risk directly affected attitudes and intentions toward using chatbots. Moreover, technological anxiety is a barrier that affects attitudes toward chatbot usage, while perceived information quality indirectly influences users to use chatbots continually. However, there was no correlation between openness to experience and attitudes toward the continued use of chatbots. The finding indicates that experienced chatbot users are concerned with privacy and time constraints. This study contributes significantly to knowledge of the impediments to the diffusion of sustainable innovations among community-enterprise entrepreneurs. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - In the 2020s, the devastating effects of anthropogenic climate change became unmistakable. Floods, storms, the mass extinction of flora and fauna, the threats of further pandemics, as well as Russia's war with Ukraine made it necessary for Europeans to act immediately. While the public was still wrangling about the best way to become more resource-conscious, in 2026 the European Union passed a directive that bound "smart", artificial-intelligence-infused technologies to the goal of reducing resource consumption by law - the Green Smart directive. The present paper traces the impact of Green Smart in three everyday domains: laundry, mobility, and gardening. It shows that Green Smart led to a "decentering"of the human with beneficial effects on the planet as well as individual wellbeing. Upon release of the directive, smart systems immediately installed policies of CO2 avoidance and resource-saving, which had been discussed for centuries already, but had never actually been implemented. While this was accompanied by fierce debates about "freedom"and the "enslavement"of humanity by technology, in everyday life, the policies led to an almost instant reduction in resource consumption. New and adapted everyday practices appeared quickly, and many of them changed people's lives clearly for the better. In general, humanity's attitude toward technology changed profoundly. Instead of expecting technology to be a mere tool, always under the immediate control of people and to be used for whatever people saw fit, technology became understood as a powerful "other", with its own needs and goals - even if those were designed by humans themselves. Instead of using technology, people started to cooperate and negotiate with technology about better ways of living.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Introduction: Anthropomorphic conversational agents (ACA) are a promising digital tool to support self-management of type 2 diabetes (T2D), albeit little explored. There is a dearth of literature on the detailed content of these interventions, which may limit effectiveness and replication. Our aim is to describe the development of an evidence and theory-based intervention to improve physical activity in older adults with T2D, subsumed in a multi-behavior intervention via a mobile application with an ACA. Methods: Overall decisions on the multi-behavior intervention design, such as the use of standardized behavior change techniques (BCTTv1), guided the development of the physical activity component. Firstly, recommendations on ambulatory activity were used to select the target behavior (walking). Meta-research on effective behavior change techniques (BCTs) was then identified. One meta-analysis linked effective BCTs with the three basic psychological needs of the self-determination theory (SDT). This meta-analysis, taken together with additional evidence on SDT, led to the selection of this theory to inform the design. BCTs were extracted from meta-research; we selected the most appropriate to be operationalized via the conversational agent through multidisciplinary discussions. Rules governing the dialogue flow and BCTs tailoring, taking the form “if some conditions hold then execute some action,” were derived based on the Basic Psychological in Exercise Scale (competence, autonomy, and relatedness scores), in conjunction with published evidence and multidisciplinary discussions. Results: Thirteen BCTs were implemented in the prototype via the ACA (e.g., goal setting behavior 1.1). Six if-then rules were derived and depicted in the dialogue steps through process flow diagrams, which map how the system functions. An example of a rule is “If competence score ≤ 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 500 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal; If competence score > 10 then, apply BCT 1.1 with 1,000 steps increments as options for the daily walking goal.” Conclusion: Evidence and SDT were translated into a mobile application prototype using an ACA to promote physical activity in older adults with T2D. This approach, which includes 13 BCTs and six if-then rules for their tailoring, may leverage the efforts of others in developing similar interventions.

AB  - Introduction: Social media infuses modern relationships with vitality and brings a series of information dissemination with subjective consciousness. Studies have indicated that official Chinese media channels are transforming their communication style from didactic hard persuasion to softened emotional management in the digital era. However, previous studies have rarely provided valid empirical evidence for the communicational transformation. The study fills the gap by providing a longitudinal time-series analysis to reveal the pattern of communication of Chinese digital Chinese official media from 2019 to 2022. Method: The study crawler collected 43,259 posts from the People’s Daily’s Weibo account from 2019 to 2021. The study analyzed the textual data with using trained artificial intelligence models. Results: This study explored the practices of the People’s Daily’s Weibo account from 2019 to 2021, COVID-19 is hardly normalized as it is still used as the justification for extraordinary measures in China. This study confirmed that People’s Daily’s Weibo account posts are undergoing softenization transformation, with the use of soft news, positive energy promotion, and the embedding of sentiment. Although the outburst of COVID-19 temporarily increased the media’s use of hard news, it only occur at the initial stage of the pandemic. Emotional posts occupy a nonnegligible amount of the People’s Daily Weibo content. However, the majority of posts are emotionally neutral and contribute to shaping the authoritative image of the party press. Discussion: Overall, the People’s Daily has softened their communication style on digital platforms and used emotional mobilization, distraction, and timely information provision to balance the political logic of building an authoritative media agency and the media logic of constructing audience relevance.

AB  - The development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to profoundly influence the human-intelligence interaction. As AI-Generated Content(AIGC) progressively approaches, and in some instances, even surpasses human-created content, it augments the natural human-intelligence interaction experience, offering users convenient and efficient information services. However, it also raises the issue of the users' perception of the persuasiveness of AIGC. Consequently, there is an imperative to empirically investigate the users' perception of the persuasiveness of AIGC. Drawing upon the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory, this paper introduces two novel variables, namely positive and negative awe, to construct a comprehensive model that elucidates the factors influencing the users' perception of the persuasiveness of AIGC. To empirically test this model, we gathers a dataset comprising 298 valid responses through a web-based questionnaire. We employ the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique for rigorous statistical analysis. The findings of this study reveal that AIGC's cognitive and relational competencies exert a significantly positive impact on the elicitation of positive awe among users, while AIGC's cognitive and emotional competencies are associated with a significantly negative effect on the generation of negative awe among users. Furthermore, this study shows that positive awe has a notably favorable influence on the users' perception of the persuasiveness of AIGC, negative awe has a negative effect on the users' perception of the persuasiveness of AIGC. Innovatively, this paper introduces the concept of awe as a pivotal mechanism influencing the users' perceptions of the persuasiveness of AIGC. Through rigorous empirical analysis, this paper provides advice for technology companies on enhancing the users' perception of the persuasiveness of AIGC. © 2023 International Consortium for Electronic Business.

AB  - Discussion is more convincing than standard, unidirectional messaging, but its interactive nature makes it difficult to scale up. We created a chatbot to emulate the most important traits of discussion. A simple argument pointing out the existence of a scientific consensus on the safety of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) already led to more positive attitudes towards GMOs, compared with a control message. Providing participants with good arguments rebutting the most common counterarguments against GMOs led to much more positive attitudes towards GMOs, whether the participants could immediately see all the arguments or could select the most relevant arguments in a chatbot. Participants holding the most negative attitudes displayed more attitude change in favour of GMOs. Participants updated their beliefs when presented with good arguments, but we found no evidence that an interactive chatbot proves more persuasive than a list of arguments and counterarguments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Objective: Our goal is to establish the feasibility of using an artificially intelligent chatbot in diverse healthcare settings to promote COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: We designed an artificially intelligent chatbot deployed via short message services and web-based platforms. Guided by communication theories, we developed persuasive messages to respond to users’ COVID-19-related questions and encourage vaccination. We implemented the system in healthcare settings in the U.S. between April 2021 and March 2022 and logged the number of users, topics discussed, and information on system accuracy in matching responses to user intents. We regularly reviewed queries and reclassified responses to better match responses to query intents as COVID-19 events evolved. Results: A total of 2479 users engaged with the system, exchanging 3994 COVID-19 relevant messages. The most popular queries to the system were about boosters and where to get a vaccine. The system's accuracy rate in matching responses to user queries ranged from 54% to 91.1%. Accuracy lagged when new information related to COVID emerged, such as that related to the Delta variant. Accuracy increased when we added new content to the system. Conclusions: It is feasible and potentially valuable to create chatbot systems using AI to facilitate access to current, accurate, complete, and persuasive information on infectious diseases. Such a system can be adapted to use with patients and populations needing detailed information and motivation to act in support of their health. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Business simulation games (BSGs) have been widely used in entrepreneurship education with positive effects. However, there are still some deficiencies in the BSGs, such as limited guidance, low uncertainty and limited simulation environment, which make it impossible to exert the maximum effect. Artificial intelligence (AI) can solve the above shortcomings. The combination of AI and BSGs is the possible development direction of BSGs. But how to effectively combine BSGs with AI is still an open question. Using a quasi-experimental design, this study uses fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to analyze how participants’ entrepreneurial attitude changes in BSGs. The results show that BSGs can effectively improve entrepreneurial attitude, and there are four types of promotion configurations. These four configurations consist of five antecedent conditions. According to the above conclusions, AI can improve entrepreneurial attitude in BSGs in various ways, such as simulating competitors, providing targeted feedback for failures, and improving game experience. The contribution of this paper is to highlight the possibility of combining AI with BSGs, and to provide suggestions on how AI can intervene in BSGs. Copyright © 2022 Chen, Chen, Ou, Wang and Chen.

AB  - Diabetic retinopathy is a microvascular complication of diabetes mellitus that is usually asymptomatic in the early stages. Therefore, its timely detection and treatment are essential. First pilot projects exist to establish a smartphone-based and AI-supported screening of DR in primary care. This study explored health professionals’ perceptions of potential barriers and enablers of using a screening such as this in primary care to understand the mechanisms that could influence implementation into routine clinical practice. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted and analysed with the help of qualitative analysis of Mayring. The following main influencing factors to implementation have been identified: personal attitude, organisation, time, financial factors, education, support, technical requirement, influence on profession and patient welfare. Most determinants could be relocated in the behaviour change wheel, a validated implementation model. Further research on the patients’ perspective and a ranking of the determinants found is needed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Argument Mining (AM) is the research area aiming at extracting natural language arguments and their relations from text, with the final goal of providing machine-processable structured data for computational models of argument. This research topic has started to attract the attention of a small community of researchers around 2014, and it is nowadays counted as one of the most promising research areas in Artificial Intelligence and Natural Language Processing in terms of growing of the community, funded projects, and involvement of companies. Recently, this research area includes also further forms of processing natural language arguments than mining, i.e., searching for arguments on the Web, argument generation and synthesis, and assessing the quality of arguments with respect to specific criteria like persuasiveness. In this chapter, we start by describing the classic argument mining tasks, and then we present the new tasks proposed lately in the literature. We discuss the obtained results in the area from a data-driven perspective. An open discussion highlights the main weaknesses suffered by the existing work in the literature, and proposes open challenges to be faced in the future. © 2022, College Publications.

AB  - Background: Chatbots are an emerging technology that show potential for mental health care apps to enable effective and practical evidence-based therapies. As this technology is still relatively new, little is known about recently developed apps and their characteristics and effectiveness. Objective: In this study, we aimed to provide an overview of the commercially available popular mental health chatbots and how they are perceived by users. Methods: We conducted an exploratory observation of 10 apps that offer support and treatment for a variety of mental health concerns with a built-in chatbot feature and qualitatively analyzed 3621 consumer reviews from the Google Play Store and 2624 consumer reviews from the Apple App Store. Results: We found that although chatbots’ personalized, humanlike interactions were positively received by users, improper responses and assumptions about the personalities of users led to a loss of interest. As chatbots are always accessible and convenient, users can become overly attached to them and prefer them over interacting with friends and family. Furthermore, a chatbot may offer crisis care whenever the user needs it because of its 24/7 availability, but even recently developed chatbots lack the understanding of properly identifying a crisis. Chatbots considered in this study fostered a judgment-free environment and helped users feel more comfortable sharing sensitive information. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that chatbots have great potential to offer social and psychological support in situations where real-world human interaction, such as connecting to friends or family members or seeking professional support, is not preferred or possible to achieve. However, there are several restrictions and limitations that these chatbots must establish according to the level of service they offer. Too much reliance on technology can pose risks, such as isolation and insufficient assistance during times of crisis. Recommendations for customization and balanced persuasion to inform the design of effective chatbots for mental health support have been outlined based on the insights of our findings. ©M D Romael Haque, Sabirat Rubya.

AB  - Background: Despite their increasing prevalence and potential, eHealth applications for behavior change suffer from a lack of adherence and from dropout. Advances in virtual coach technology provide new opportunities to improve this. However, these applications still do not always offer what people need. We, therefore, need a better understanding of people’s needs and how to address these, based on both actual experiences of users and their reflections on envisioned scenarios. Methods: We conducted a longitudinal study in which 671 smokers interacted with a virtual coach in five sessions. The virtual coach assigned them a new preparatory activity for quitting smoking or increasing physical activity in each session. Participants provided feedback on the activity in the next session. After the five sessions, participants were asked to describe barriers and motivators for doing their activities. In addition, they provided their views on videos of scenarios such as receiving motivational messages. To understand users’ needs, we took a mixed-methods approach. This approach triangulated findings from qualitative data, quantitative data, and the literature. Results: We identified 14 main themes that describe people’s views of their current and future behaviors concerning an eHealth application. These themes relate to the behaviors themselves, the users, other parties involved in a behavior, and the environment. The most prevalent theme was the perceived usefulness of behaviors, especially whether they were informative, helpful, motivating, or encouraging. The timing and intensity of behaviors also mattered. With regards to the users, their perceived importance of and motivation to change, autonomy, and personal characteristics were major themes. Another important role was played by other parties that may be involved in a behavior, such as general practitioners or virtual coaches. Here, the themes of companionableness, accountability, and nature of the other party (i.e., human vs AI) were relevant. The last set of main themes was related to the environment in which a behavior is performed. Prevalent themes were the availability of sufficient time, the presence of prompts and triggers, support from one’s social environment, and the diversity of other environmental factors. We provide recommendations for addressing each theme. Conclusions: The integrated method of experience-based and envisioning-based needs acquisition with a triangulate analysis provided a comprehensive needs classification (empirically and theoretically grounded). We expect that our themes and recommendations for addressing them will be helpful for designing applications for health behavior change that meet people’s needs. Designers should especially focus on the perceived usefulness of application components. To aid future work, we publish our dataset with user characteristics and 5,074 free-text responses from 671 people. Copyright 2022 Albers et al.

AB  - Background: Mobile health (mHealth) interventions may help adolescents adopt healthy lifestyles. However, attrition in these interventions is high. Overall, there is a lack of research on nonusage attrition in adolescents, particularly regarding the role of socioeconomic status (SES). Objective: The aim of this study was to focus on the role of SES in the following three research questions (RQs): When do adolescents stop using an mHealth intervention (RQ1)? Why do they report nonusage attrition (RQ2)? Which intervention components (ie, self-regulation component, narrative, and chatbot) prevent nonusage attrition among adolescents (RQ3)? Methods: A total of 186 Flemish adolescents (aged 12-15 years) participated in a 12-week mHealth program. Log data were monitored to measure nonusage attrition and usage duration for the 3 intervention components. A web-based questionnaire was administered to assess reasons for attrition. A survival analysis was conducted to estimate the time to attrition and determine whether this differed according to SES (RQ1). Descriptive statistics were performed to map the attrition reasons, and Fisher exact tests were used to determine if these reasons differed depending on the educational track (RQ2). Mixed effects Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to estimate the associations between the use duration of the 3 components during the first week and attrition. An interaction term was added to the regression models to determine whether associations differed by the educational track (RQ3). Results: After 12 weeks, 95.7% (178/186) of the participants stopped using the app. 30.1% (56/186) of the adolescents only opened the app on the installation day, and 44.1% (82/186) stopped using the app in the first week. Attrition at any given time during the intervention period was higher for adolescents from the nonacademic educational track compared with those from the academic track. The other SES indicators (family affluence and perceived financial situation) did not explain attrition. The most common reasons for nonusage attrition among participants were perceiving that the app did not lead to behavior change, not liking the app, thinking that they already had a sufficiently healthy lifestyle, using other apps, and not being motivated by the environment. Attrition reasons did not differ depending on the educational track. More time spent in the self-regulation and narrative components during the first week was associated with lower attrition, whereas chatbot use duration was not associated with attrition rates. No moderating effects of SES were observed in the latter association. Conclusions: Nonusage attrition was high, especially among adolescents in the nonacademic educational track. The reported reasons for attrition were diverse, with no statistical differences according to the educational level. The duration of the use of the self-regulation and narrative components during the first week may prevent attrition for both educational tracks. © Laura Maenhout, Carmen Peuters, Greet Cardon, Geert Crombez, Ann DeSmet, Sofie Compernolle

AB  - Until we make the necessary decision to jettison deepfake from our discussions of AI-generated media, we will fail to invent arguments that are well suited to the needs of people who do not live their lives in relation to a digital environment filled with fake and genuine media but, instead, to a digital environment that presents computer-articulated human beings with a diet of provisional simulations marked by the presence of nonpresence. Even though deepfake has come to mean very much the same thing to people from different walks of life when pressed to invent persuasive claims about deepfake media at the rhetorical levels of conjecture, definition, quality, and action, the rhetorical work that has been done at the level of definition has created an exigence within the discourse on deepfake media. Because culturally recognizable digital forms, including deepfakes, are computer-generated simulations, it must be concluded that deepfake simulations express themselves in the manner of simulations, meaning that they give provisional (arranged for the present, changeable, temporary) expression, marked by the presence of nonpresence, to mathematically described, algorithmically defined models of the real. Being another form of simulation within an environment of simulations, deepfake cannot be defined as either fake, false, or inauthentic, or genuine, true, or authentic. Instead, computer-generated media, including deepfakes, must be defined as provisional signs that circulate above and beyond the order of truth as defined by both the order of obligatory signs (medieval) and the order of arbitrary signs (modern) because computer-generated simulations of arbitrary signs are constrained to speak the absence of presence, the presence of a concept not present, the presence of nonpresence. © 2023 Common Ground Research Networks.

AB  - Agent-based automated negotiation is a promising approach for business negotiation; however, most studies in this field focus on negotiation strategies, ignoring the role of similarities between negotiating parties and the interactive social nature of negotiations. This study considers similarities between proposed and expected values in automatic negotiations to improve the agent perception ability. A cloud model was innovatively applied to calculate similarities, and overcome subjective characterization of proposed values in negotiations. Additionally, two social factors, i.e., emotion and familiarity, were identified in negotiations, the Web-Fechner law was applied to model an agent's generation of emotion, and a familiarity function was constructed to measure the level of familiarity between negotiating agents. Finally, a stage model for agent-based emotional negotiation which integrates similarity, emotion, and familiarity was established. A series of numerical experiments were conducted and comparative analyses of the proposed model with other similarity measures and existing negotiation models were conducted to test the performance of the proposed model. The results show that the proposed model can lead to more successful negotiations and fairer negotiating outcomes and simultaneously, maintain competitive negotiation efficiency. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study addresses the factors that increase the persuasive impact of testimonial narrative messages on artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, the effect on two variables that, to date, have not been explored in this field is analyzed: the attitudes toward AI (positive versus ambivalent) expressed by the protagonist of the narrative message (a testimonial in audiovisual format) and the role of participants’ prior beliefs about AI. An online experiment (N = 652) was carried out to contrast the effect of attitudinal similarity on identification with the protagonist of the narrative message and the indirect effect on attitudes and intention to use AI. The results showed that the message whose protagonist expressed positive attitudes toward AI induced greater identification only in those participants with previous positive beliefs. In contrast, the message whose protagonist expressed ambivalent attitudes toward AI induced greater identification only among participants with previous negative beliefs. In addition, identification and cognitive elaboration were found to mediate the effect of attitudinal similarity on the attitude toward and intention to use AI. These findings are discussed in the context of narrative persuasion research and the development of campaigns for improving social perceptions of data science. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - The advent of Internet of Things (IoT) technology has revolutionized both the roles and functions of everyday objects and how users interact with them. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and an advanced capacity for communication, smart objects can now function as communication sources and deliver persuasive messages. This study investigates how different types of agency and source cues shape the persuasiveness of a smart object via social presence. When users interacted with a smart object that exerted its own agency, they sensed greater social presence when the object used machine cues rather than human cues. Conversely, when users interacted with a smart object that allowed the user to exercise their own agency, human cues, rather than machine cues, produced greater feelings of social presence, which enhanced the persuasiveness of the messages conveyed by the object. However, the persuasive effects of social presence were reversed when the interaction prompted AI anxiety in the user. © 2021

AB  - Road accidents wreck lives. Could technology stop them from happening? Driving better road safety with technology and artificial intelligence are the key elements considered by several carmakers. The key aspect of transportation in the future is to build an ecosystem comprising autonomous, connected, electric and shared mobility. The evolution of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can potentially aid transportation to people and be deployed to resolve mobility-related pain for drivers and safety on roads while changing lanes. Thus, the intelligent assistance system should be smart enough to track such vehicles while deviating into another lane. In this paper, we propose a lane change prediction framework for feature learning, with the aim to have a deep and comprehensive understanding of lane change behaviors, meanwhile, reach a high performance based on the selected features. A time-step dataset with more than 1000 features is constructed from vehicle trajectory data. To identify the key features involved in the original feature set, an XGBoost-based three-step feature learning algorithm is proposed, which integrates the feature importance ranking, metric selection and recursive feature elimination. After analyzing the accuracy of test data from different time segment positions, the sliding window method is applied on a time-step dataset with filtered features to properly select time segments, which are flattened into corresponding time-series dataset for model prediction. In our case studies, a publicly available dataset, Next Generation SIMulation (NGSIM), is adopted to conduct experiments of feature learning and lane change prediction, where we achieved a new state-of-art accuracy with 97.6% under the time-series data of 75 selected features and 1-second window size with predictor XGBoost after adopting proposed three-step method, which is superior to the other state-of-the-art feature selection methods.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care. Methods: We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study. Results: The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations-user-centered design and privacy and security-that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes. Conclusions: Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Chest X-ray (CXR) images are considered useful to monitor and investigate a variety of pulmonary disorders such as COVID-19, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis (TB). With recent technological advancements, such diseases may now be recognized more precisely using computer-assisted diagnostics. Without compromising the classification accuracy and better feature extraction, deep learning (DL) model to predict four different categories is proposed in this study. The proposed model is validated with publicly available datasets of 7132 chest x-ray (CXR) images. Furthermore, results are interpreted and explained using Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Local Interpretable Modelagnostic Explanation (LIME), and SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) for better understandably. Initially, convolution features are extracted to collect high-level object-based information. Next, shapely values from SHAP, predictability results from LIME, and heatmap from Grad-CAM are used to explore the black-box approach of the DL model, achieving average test accuracy of 94.31 ± 1.01% and validation accuracy of 94.54 ± 1.33 for 10-fold cross validation. Finally, in order to validate the model and qualify medical risk, medical sensations of classification are taken to consolidate the explanations generated from the eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) framework. The results suggest that XAI and DL models give clinicians/medical professionals persuasive and coherent conclusions related to the detection and categorization of COVID-19, Pneumonia, and TB. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays, artificial intelligence (AI) systems make predictions in numerous high stakes domains, including credit-risk assessment and medical diagnostics. Consequently, AI systems increasingly affect humans, yet many state-of-the-art systems lack transparency and thus, deny the individual’s “right to explanation”. As a remedy, researchers and practitioners have developed explainable AI, which provides reasoning on how AI systems infer individual predictions. However, with recent legal initiatives demanding comprehensive explainability throughout the (development of an) AI system, we argue that the pre-processing stage has been unjustifiably neglected and should receive greater attention in current efforts to establish explainability. In this paper, we focus on introducing explainability to an integral part of the pre-processing stage: feature selection. Specifically, we build upon design science research to develop a design framework for explainable feature selection. We instantiate the design framework in a running software artifact and evaluate it in two focus group sessions. Our artifact helps organizations to persuasively justify feature selection to stakeholders and, thus, comply with upcoming AI legislation. We further provide researchers and practitioners with a design framework consisting of meta-requirements and design principles for explainable feature selection. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Open-ended domains, where the focus is not about learning specific expert movements but about adopting healthy physical activity behaviours, require the use of unsupervised algorithms and artificial intelligence in education techniques for modelling evolving patterns from physical activity sensor data to enable feedback and personalisation. We present a suite of unsupervised window-based algorithms that detect physical activity changes aligned with learning objectives from accelerometer data. These are translated into learner model attributes and used to generate timely feedback. We illustrate our method in the context of a health education program that teaches adolescents about healthy physical activity behaviours through an application connected to a wrist-worn activity tracker. We present the feedback generated by our algorithms and report on the qualitative evaluation with four experts. We conclude that the automated feedback is useful, important and timely to leverage adolescents' physical activity learning. © 30th International Conference on Computers in Education Conference, ICCE 2022 - Proceedings.

AB  - Firms increasingly invest in chatbots that provide purchase recommendations. However, customers often reject recommendations by chatbots because they find neither the contents of the recommendation (message-level persuasiveness) nor the chatbot itself (source-level persuasiveness) persuasive. To overcome these barriers and increase purchase intention, this study examines how the content of recommendation messages should be designed and which communication style the chatbot should use to provide recommendation messages. Results of a 2 (two-sided vs. one-sided recommendation message) × 3 (warm vs. competent vs. neutral communication style) between-subject online experiment show that a two-sided recommendation message increases purchase intention, but only for chatbots using a warm or competent communication style. Whereas a warm chatbot leads to higher purchase intentions of a recommendation through promoting its source persuasiveness, a competent chatbot increases recommendation effectiveness by promoting message persuasiveness. Therefore, firms should refine a chatbot's communication style for providing recommendations that persuade customers to purchase. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is a transitional state between normal aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, not all aMCI patients are observed to convert to AD dementia. Therefore, developing a predictive algorithm for the conversion of aMCI to AD dementia is important. Parametric methods, such as logistic regression, have been developed; however, it is difficult to reflect complex patterns, such as non-linear relationships and interactions between variables. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the predictive power of aMCI patients’ conversion to dementia by using an interpretable machine learning (IML) algorithm and to identify the factors that increase the risk of individual conversion to dementia in each patient. Methods: We prospectively recruited 705 patients with aMCI who had been followed-up for at least 3 years after undergoing baseline neuropsychological tests at the Samsung Medical Center between 2007 and 2019. We used neuropsychological tests and apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype data to develop a predictive algorithm. The model-building and validation datasets were composed of data of 565 and 140 patients, respectively. For global interpretation, four algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting) were compared. For local interpretation, individual conditional expectations (ICE) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to analyze individual patients. Results: Among the four algorithms, the extreme gradient boost model showed the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.852 and an accuracy of 0.807. Variables, such as age, education, the scores of visuospatial and memory domains, the sum of boxes of the Clinical Dementia Rating scale, Mini-Mental State Examination, and APOE genotype were important features for creating the algorithm. Through ICE and SHAP analyses, it was also possible to interpret which variables acted as strong factors for each patient. Conclusion: We were able to propose a predictive algorithm for each aMCI individual’s conversion to dementia using the IML technique. This algorithm is expected to be useful in clinical practice and the research field, as it can suggest conversion with high accuracy and identify the degree of influence of risk factors for each patient.

AB  - Background: Overweight and obesity have now reached a state of a pandemic despite the clinical and commercial programs available. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots have a strong potential in optimizing such programs for weight loss. Objective: This study aimed to review AI chatbot use cases for weight loss and to identify the essential components for prolonging user engagement. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the 5-stage framework by Arksey and O'Malley. Articles were searched across nine electronic databases (ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) until July 9, 2021. Gray literature, reference lists, and Google Scholar were also searched. Results: A total of 23 studies with 2231 participants were included and evaluated in this review. Most studies (8/23, 35%) focused on using AI chatbots to promote both a healthy diet and exercise, 13% (3/23) of the studies used AI chatbots solely for lifestyle data collection and obesity risk assessment whereas only 4% (1/23) of the studies focused on promoting a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, and stress management. In total, 48% (11/23) of the studies used only text-based AI chatbots, 52% (12/23) operationalized AI chatbots through smartphones, and 39% (9/23) integrated data collected through fitness wearables or Internet of Things appliances. The core functions of AI chatbots were to provide personalized recommendations (20/23, 87%), motivational messages (18/23, 78%), gamification (6/23, 26%), and emotional support (6/23, 26%). Study participants who experienced speech- and augmented reality-based chatbot interactions in addition to text-based chatbot interactions reported higher user engagement because of the convenience of hands-free interactions. Enabling conversations through multiple platforms (eg, SMS text messaging, Slack, Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, or Facebook Messenger) and devices (eg, laptops, Google Home, and Amazon Alexa) was reported to increase user engagement. The human semblance of chatbots through verbal and nonverbal cues improved user engagement through interactivity and empathy. Other techniques used in text-based chatbots included personally and culturally appropriate colloquial tones and content; emojis that emulate human emotional expressions; positively framed words; citations of credible information sources; personification; validation; and the provision of real-time, fast, and reliable recommendations. Prevailing issues included privacy; accountability; user burden; and interoperability with other databases, third-party applications, social media platforms, devices, and appliances. Conclusions: AI chatbots should be designed to be human-like, personalized, contextualized, immersive, and enjoyable to enhance user experience, engagement, behavior change, and weight loss. These require the integration of health metrics (eg, based on self-reports and wearable trackers), personality and preferences (eg, based on goal achievements), circumstantial behaviors (eg, trigger-based overconsumption), and emotional states (eg, chatbot conversations and wearable stress detectors) to deliver personalized and effective recommendations for weight loss. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - There has been considerable work recently in the natural language community and elsewhere on Responsible AI. Much of this work focuses on fairness and biases (henceforth Risks 1.0), following the 2016 best seller: Weapons of Math Destruction. Two books published in 2022, The Chaos Machine and Like, Comment, Subscribe, raise additional risks to public health/safety/security such as genocide, insurrection, polarized politics, vaccinations (henceforth, Risks 2.0). These books suggest that the use of machine learning to maximize engagement in social media has created a Frankenstein Monster that is exploiting human weaknesses with persuasive technology, the illusory truth effect, Pavlovian conditioning, and Skinner's intermittent variable reinforcement. Just as we cannot expect tobacco companies to sell fewer cigarettes and prioritize public health ahead of profits, so too, it may be asking too much of companies (and countries) to stop trafficking in misinformation given that it is so effective and so insanely profitable (at least in the short term). Eventually, we believe the current chaos will end, like the lawlessness in Wild West, because chaos is bad for business. As computer scientists, this paper will summarize criticisms from other fields and focus on implications for computer science; we will not attempt to contribute to those other fields. There is quite a bit of work in computer science on these risks, especially on Risks 1.0 (bias and fairness), but more work is needed, especially on Risks 2.0 (addictive, dangerous, and deadly). © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Background: Improving preconception health can benefit all women, their children, and their families regardless of their individual pregnancy intentions. Rapidly increasing access to information technology and online engagement have created opportunities to use digital health resources to engage with preconception women regarding lifestyle behaviors. Objective: This study explores how preconception women engage with digital health resources and online platforms to inform the design and development of a digital health resource to support women to make positive behavior change for their preconception health. Methods: This codesign research followed the Double Diamond process, which focuses on contextualization and explorative processes in phase 1 and ideation and development processes in phase 2. Phase 1 is reported on in this study and was undertaken via a series of 1-on-1 in-depth interviews with female participants (N=12) aged 18-45 years over 3 months. Interviews were designed to explore participants' lived experiences in relation to their health and desired supports for healthy lifestyle behaviors. The first interview focused on participants' perceptions of health and health behaviors, the second interview focused on social connections for health, and the third interview focused on digital health information and supports. Conversations from the first interview informed the development of the second interview, and conversations from the second interview informed the development of the third interview. Community advisors (N=8) met to provide feedback and advice to the researchers throughout the interview process. Qualitative analyses of transcripts from interviews were undertaken by 2 researchers before a deductive process identified themes mapped to the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior (COM-B) framework. Results: In total, 9 themes and 8 subthemes were identified from 124 codes. In relation to digital health resources, specifically, participants were already engaging with a range of digital health resources and had high expectations of these. Digital health resources needed to be easy to access, make women's busy lives easier, be evidence based, and be reputable. Social connectedness was also highly important to our participants, with information and advice from peers with similar experiences being preferred over yet more online health information. Online communities facilitated these social interactions. Participants were open to the idea of chatbots and virtual assistants but acknowledged that they would not replace authentic social interactions. Conclusions: Codesigned digital health resources should be evidence based, reputable, and easy to access. Social connections were considered highly important to women, and designers of digital health resources should consider how they can increase opportunities for women to connect and learn from each other to promote health behaviors. ©Ruth Elizabeth Walker, Sara Quong, Patrick Olivier, Ling Wu, Jue Xie, Jacqueline Boyle.

AB  - At present, the e-commerce sector is characterised by rapidly increasing volumes of parcel deliveries, causing congestion, noise and air pollution in public spaces. The number of CEPs is also increasing due to more partial deliveries, multiple delivery attempts and a high number of returns. According to the 'eCommerce Study Austria', the return rate for the year 2020 will be over 40 percent. Increased freight transport on the last mile will lead to more congestion, noise and emissions. On the demand side, online shops often offer no or only very limited climate-friendly delivery options, which contradicts the growing sustainability awareness of many end customers. The design, development and evaluation of technological, behavioural and logistical interventions will address these gaps. The Green eCommerce project aims to enable online customers to make their deliveries more sustainable and to increase their awareness of sustainable goods transport through technological (Al-based chatbot, 3D fitting tool), behavioural (playful reward system, persuasive design patterns) and logistical (choice of e-transport) innovations. In particular, the aim is to minimise returns and multiple home delivery attempts, and to encourage bulk ordering and direct delivery of regional products. The extension of existing online shops with these innovative and modular components represents a novelty in the sense that traffic avoidance, traffic optimisation and modal shift can be achieved through the behaviour of online customers. Compared to current measures in freight logistics (e.g. route optimisation, electrification of the fleet, construction of hubs), this persuasive approach aimed at the end consumer has hardly been researched. This package of measures is currently being implemented in three online shops and evaluated in terms of acceptance, usability and environmental impact. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Contextualization: In recent years, the popularity of virtual agents particularly task-oriented dialogue agents has increased immensely due to their effectiveness and simplicity in various domains such as industry, e-commerce, and health. Problem: In real-world, users do not have always a predefined and immutable goal, i.e., they may upgrade/downgrade/update their task goal dynamically depending upon their utility and the serving capability of the assisting agent. However, the existing Virtual Agents (VAs) in the dialogue literature relinquish and yield dialogue failure if they find any dynamic goal setting or goal unavailability scenarios. Contributions and methodology: Motivated by these inabilities of existing VAs, we propose some intelligent and expert Dialogue Agents (A Unified Dialogue Agent and Multi-agent Dialogue system) that can deal with dynamic and goal unavailability situations to elevate both user satisfaction and the agent's utility particularly task success rate. The proposed architecture incorporates a goal guiding module namely Dynamic and Co-Operative Goal Driven Module (DyCoGDM), which traces goal status and resolves goal discrepancy through dynamic goal setting (Goal Formulator) and personalized persuasion (Goal Persuader) mechanisms. We also created and annotated a dialogue corpus because of unavailability of such corpus featured with dynamic and goal unavailability scenarios. Findings and implications: Our proposed method outperforms several baselines and state of the art methods in all evaluation metrics. The proposed VA is capable of dealing with dynamic goals and goal unavailability scenarios effectively. The study found that the persona aware persuasive dialogue agent outperforms generalized persuasive dialogue agent by a large margin. Furthermore, we also observed that the task oriented reward is the most essential reward for training a reinforcement learning based agent and agents trained without task based reward do not even converge. © 2021

AB  - Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) can promote behavior change in patients. It was the aim of our study to make JITAIs adaptable, i.e., to configure JITAIs for different purposes and to personalize them for different participants, whilst enabling central maintenance and integrated data analysis across deployments and individuals. We present a concept for adaptable JITAIs that was created following a design science approach. It builds on multi-level conceptual modeling and knowledge graphs and will be evaluated in user studies. © 2022 The authors, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and IOS Press.

AB  - Background: Increased adoption of off-the-shelf conversational agents (CAs) brings opportunities to integrate therapeutic interventions. Motivational Interviewing (MI) can then be integrated with CAs for cost-effective access to it. MI can be especially beneficial for parents who often have low motivation because of limited time and resources to eat healthy together with their children. Objective: We developed a Motivational Interviewing Conversational Agent (MICA) to improve healthy eating in parents who serve as a proxy for health behavior change in their children. Proxy relationships involve a person serving as a catalyst for behavior change in another person. Parents, serving as proxies, can bring about behavior change in their children. Methods: We conducted user test sessions of the MICA prototype to understand the perceived acceptability and usefulness of the MICA prototype by parents. A total of 24 parents of young children participated in 2 user test sessions with MICA, approximately 2 weeks apart. After parents’ interaction with the MICA prototype in each user test session, we used qualitative interviews to understand parents’ perceptions and suggestions for improvements in MICA. Results: Findings showed participants’ perceived usefulness of MICAs for helping them self-reflect and motivating them to adopt healthier eating habits together with their children. Participants further suggested various ways in which MICA can help them safely manage their children’s eating behaviors and provide customized support for their proxy needs and goals. Conclusions: We have discussed how the user experience of CAs can be improved to uniquely offer support to parents who serve as proxies in changing the behavior of their children. We have concluded with implications for a larger context of designing MI-based CAs for supporting proxy relationships for health behavior change. ©Diva Smriti, Tsui-Sui Annie Kao, Rahil Rathod, Ji Youn Shin, Wei Peng, Jake Williams, Munif Ishad Mujib, Meghan Colosimo, Jina Huh-Yoo.

AB  - Background: Despite showing strong evidence of positive outcomes, a common problem in the field of digital health is poor engagement and adherence. Non-health care, for-profit digital ventures, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, conduct behavioral experiments to increase user engagement. To our knowledge, digital health organizations have not published similar types of experiments in ad libitum environments, and there are limited published data indicating whether nudges and prompts can be leveraged to increase engagement with digital health interventions. Objective: The main objective of our 3-arm randomized controlled trial is to test whether registered members in two well-established digital health courses for anxiety and depression will engage with four different types of nudges and prompts, and whether engaging with nudges and prompts increases engagement within the courses. Methods: New members who register for the self-guided anxiety and depression courses on the Evolution Health platform will be randomized into 1 of 3 arms. The first control arm will feature a member home page without any behavioral nudges or prompts. The second arm will feature a member home page with a Tip-of-the-Day section containing directive content. Arm 3 will feature a member home page with a Tip-of-the-Day section containing social proof and present bias content. The third arm will also feature a to-do item checklist. Results: The experiment was designed in August 2021 and was launched in November 2021. Initially, we will measure engagement with the tips and the to-do checklist by calculating the frequency of use by age and gender. If members do engage, we will then, according to age and gender, examine whether nudges and prompts result in higher course completion rates and whether specific types of prompts and nudges are more popular than others. Conclusions: Our 3-arm randomized controlled trial will be the first to compare four distinct types of behavioral prompts and nudges in two self-guided digital health courses that were designed to treat mental health issues. We expect the results to generate insights into which types of behavioral prompts and nudges work best in the population. If they are shown to increase engagement, the insights will then be used to apply prompts and nudges to the platform's addiction-focused courses. Based on the results of the experiment, the insights will be applied to using artificial intelligence to train the platform to recognize different usage patterns and provide specific engagement recommendations to stratified users. © 2022 JMIR Publications.

AB  - Bayesian persuasion is a model for understanding strategic information revelation: an agent with an informational advantage, called a sender, strategically discloses information by sending signals to another agent, called a receiver. In algorithmic Bayesian persuasion, we are interested in efficiently designing the sender's signaling schemes that lead the receiver to take action in favor of the sender. This paper studies algorithmic Bayesian-persuasion settings where the receiver's feasible actions are specified by combinatorial constraints, e.g., matroids or paths in graphs. We first show that constant-factor approximation is NP-hard even in some special cases of matroids or paths. We then propose a polynomial-time algorithm for general matroids by assuming the number of states of nature to be a constant. We finally consider a relaxed notion of persuasiveness, called CCE-persuasiveness, and present a sufficient condition for polynomial-time approximability. © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Persuasive system design (PSD) is an umbrella term for designs in information systems (IS) that can influence people’s attitude, behavior, or decision making for better or for worse. On the one hand, PSD can improve users’ engagement and motivation to change their attitude, behavior, or decision making in a favorable way, which can help them achieve a desired outcome and, thus, improve their wellbeing. On the other hand, PSD misuse can lead to unethical and undesirable outcomes, such as disclosing unnecessary information or agreeing to terms that do not favor users, which, in turn, can negatively impact their wellbeing. These powerful persuasive designs can involve concepts such as gamification, gamblification, and digital nudging, which all have become prominent in recent years and have been implemented successfully across different sectors, such as education, e-health, e-governance, e-finance, and digital privacy contexts. However, such persuasive influence on individuals raises ethical questions as PSD can impair users’ autonomy or persuade them towards a third party’s goals and, hence, lead to unethical decision-making processes and outcomes. In human-computer interaction, recent advances in artificial intelligence have made this topic particularly significant. These novel technologies allow one to influence the decisions that users make, to gather data, and to profile and persuade users into unethical outcomes. These unethical outcomes can lead to psychological and emotional damage to users. To understand the role that ethics play in persuasive system design, we conducted an exhaustive systematic literature analysis and 20 interviews to overview ethical considerations for persuasive system design. Furthermore, we derive potential propositions for more ethical PSD and shed light on potential research gaps. © 2022 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated pre-existing health disparities. People of historically underserved communities, including racial and ethnic minority groups and people with lower incomes and educational attainments, experienced disproportionate premature mortality, access to healthcare, and vaccination acceptance and adoption. At the same time, the pandemic increased reliance on digital devices, offering a unique opportunity to leverage digital communication channels to address health inequities, particularly related to COVID-19 vaccination. We offer a real-world, systematic approach to designing personalized behavior change email and text messaging interventions that address individual barriers with evidence-based behavioral science inclusive of underserved populations. Integrating design processes such as the Double Diamond model with evidence-based behavioral science intervention development offers a unique opportunity to create equitable interventions. Further, leveraging behavior change artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities allows for both personalizing and automating that personalization to address barriers to COVID-19 vaccination at scale. The result is an intervention whose broad component library meets the needs of a diverse population and whose technology can deliver the right components for each individual.

AB  - Background: This review aims to systematically evaluate the currently available evidence investigating the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in the field of cardiac transplantation. Furthermore, based on the challenges identified we aim to provide a series of recommendations and a knowledge base for future research in the field of ML and heart transplantation. Methods: A systematic database search was conducted of original articles that explored the use of ML and/or AI in heart transplantation in EMBASE, MEDLINE, Cochrane database, and Google Scholar, from inception to November 2021. Results: Our search yielded 237 articles, of which 13 studies were included in this review, featuring 463 850 patients. Three main areas of application were identified: (1) ML for predictive modeling of heart transplantation mortality outcomes; (2) ML in graft failure outcomes; (3) ML to aid imaging in heart transplantation. The results of the included studies suggest that AI and ML are more accurate in predicting graft failure and mortality than traditional scoring systems and conventional regression analysis. Major predictors of graft failure and mortality identified in ML models were: length of hospital stay, immunosuppressive regimen, recipient's age, congenital heart disease, and organ ischemia time. Other potential benefits include analyzing initial lab investigations and imaging, assisting a patient with medication adherence, and creating positive behavioral changes to minimize further cardiovascular risk. Conclusion: ML demonstrated promising applications for improving heart transplantation outcomes and patient-centered care, nevertheless, there remain important limitations relating to implementing AI into everyday surgical practices. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in various domains in artificial intelligence including computer vision and natural language processing. A DNN is typically trained for many epochs and then a validation dataset is used to select the DNN in an epoch (we simply call this epoch “the last epoch”) as the final model for making predictions on unseen samples, while it usually cannot achieve a perfect accuracy on unseen samples. An interesting question is “how many test (unseen) samples that a DNN misclassifies in the last epoch were ever correctly classified by the DNN before the last epoch?”. In this paper, we empirically study this question and find on several benchmark datasets that the vast majority of the misclassified samples in the last epoch were ever classified correctly before the last epoch, which means that the predictions for these samples were flipped from “correct” to “wrong”. Motivated by this observation, we propose to restrict the behavior changes of a DNN on the correctly-classified samples so that the correct local boundaries can be maintained and the flipping error on unseen samples can be largely reduced. Extensive experiments1 on different benchmark datasets with different modern network architectures demonstrate that the proposed flipping error reduction (FER) approach can substantially improve the generalization, the robustness, and the transferability of DNNs without introducing any additional network parameters or inference cost, only with a negligible training overhead.

AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used in health care to deliver behavior change interventions. Their evaluation often includes categorizing the behavior change techniques (BCTs) using a classification system of which the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) is one of the most common. Previous studies have presented descriptive summaries of behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, but no in-depth study reporting the use of BCTs in these interventions has been published to date. Objective: This review aims to describe behavior change interventions delivered by CAs and to identify the BCTs and theories guiding their design. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane's Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the first 10 pages of Google and Google Scholar in April 2021. We included primary, experimental studies evaluating a behavior change intervention delivered by a CA. BCTs coding followed the BCTTv1. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. Descriptive analysis and frequent itemset mining to identify BCT clusters were performed. Results: We included 47 studies reporting on mental health (n=19, 40%), chronic disorders (n=14, 30%), and lifestyle change (n=14, 30%) interventions. There were 20/47 embodied CAs (43%) and 27/47 CAs (57%) represented a female character. Most CAs were rule based (34/47, 72%). Experimental interventions included 63 BCTs, (mean 9 BCTs; range 2-21 BCTs), while comparisons included 32 BCTs (mean 2 BCTs; range 2-17 BCTs). Most interventions included BCTs 4.1 "Instruction on how to perform a behavior" (34/47, 72%), 3.3 "Social support" (emotional; 27/47, 57%), and 1.2 "Problem solving" (24/47, 51%). A total of 12/47 studies (26%) were informed by a behavior change theory, mainly the Transtheoretical Model and the Social Cognitive Theory. Studies using the same behavior change theory included different BCTs. Conclusions: There is a need for the more explicit use of behavior change theories and improved reporting of BCTs in CA interventions to enhance the analysis of intervention effectiveness and improve the reproducibility of research. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Emotional disorders are the most common mental disorders globally. Psychological treatments have been found to be useful for a significant number of cases, but up to 40% of patients do not respond to psychotherapy as expected. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods might enhance psychotherapy by providing therapists and patients with real-or close to real-time recommendations according to the patient’s response to treatment. The goal of this investigation is to systematically review the evidence on the use of AI-based methods to enhance outcomes in psychological interventions in real-time or close to real-time. The search included studies indexed in the electronic databases Scopus, Pubmed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The terms used for the electronic search included variations of the words “psychotherapy”, “artificial intelligence”, and “emotional disorders”. From the 85 full texts assessed, only 10 studies met our eligibility criteria. In these, the most frequently used AI technique was conversational AI agents, which are chatbots based on software that can be accessed online with a computer or a smartphone. Overall, the reviewed investigations indicated significant positive consequences of using AI to enhance psychotherapy and reduce clinical symptomatology. Additionally, most studies reported high satisfaction, engagement, and retention rates when implementing AI to enhance psychotherapy in real-or close to real-time. Despite the potential of AI to make interventions more flexible and tailored to patients’ needs, more methodologically robust studies are needed. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Personalization is a key aspect when developing applications targeting health behaviour change. However, the use of personalized mobile interventions for lifestyle behaviour is still in its infancy. Based on our former research on mobile applications to support cardiac patients in health behaviour change, we identified four key motivations to enhance the personalization offered in applications targeting health behaviour change. In this paper, we propose a mixed-methods approach, using both qualitative and quantitative data collected in prior studies, to apply personalization in the design of health applications. Our approach consists of five steps: 1) collecting data for personalization, 2) detecting patient profiles using clustering methods, 3) understanding patient profiles using a graphical representation, 4) describing patient profiles using personas, and 5) personalizing a health application according to patient profiles. One of the major strengths of our approach is that it combines established HCI techniques such as personas and data visualization techniques with methods from big data analytics and artificial intelligence to identify ways to personalize health applications. We conclude by presenting future directions to apply personalization in the domain of health technologies.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic has revealed the weaknesses of most health systems around the world, collapsing them and depleting their available health care resources. Fortunately, the development and enforcement of specific public health policies, such as vaccination, mask wearing, and social distancing, among others, has reduced the prevalence and complications associated with COVID-19 in its acute phase. However, the aftermath of the global pandemic has called for an efficient approach to manage patients with long COVID-19. This is a great opportunity to leverage on innovative digital health solutions to provide exhausted health care systems with the most cost-effective and efficient tools available to support the clinical management of this population. In this context, the SENSING-AI project is focused on the research toward the implementation of an artificial intelligence-driven digital health solution that supports both the adaptive self-management of people living with long COVID-19 and the health care staff in charge of the management and follow-up of this population. Objective: The objective of this protocol is the prospective collection of psychometric and biometric data from 10 patients for training algorithms and prediction models to complement the SENSING-AI cohort. Methods: Publicly available health and lifestyle data registries will be consulted and complemented with a retrospective cohort of anonymized data collected from clinical information of patients diagnosed with long COVID-19. Furthermore, a prospective patient-generated data set will be captured using wearable devices and validated patient-reported outcomes questionnaires to complement the retrospective cohort. Finally, the 'Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reuse' guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship will be applied to the resulting data set to encourage the continuous process of discovery, evaluation, and reuse of information for the research community at large. Results: The SENSING-AI cohort is expected to be completed during 2022. It is expected that sufficient data will be obtained to generate artificial intelligence models based on behavior change and mental well-being techniques to improve patients' self-management, while providing useful and timely clinical decision support services to health care professionals based on risk stratification models and early detection of exacerbations. Conclusions: SENSING-AI focuses on obtaining high-quality data of patients with long COVID-19 during their daily life. Supporting these patients is of paramount importance in the current pandemic situation, including supporting their health care professionals in a cost-effective and efficient management of long COVID-19.  © 2022 Aïna Fuster-Casanovas.

AB  - Background: Although physical activity can mitigate disease trajectories and improve and sustain mental health, many people have become less physically active during the COVID-19 pandemic. Personal information technology, such as activity trackers and chatbots, can technically converse with people and possibly enhance their autonomous motivation to engage in physical activity. The literature on behavior change techniques (BCTs) and self-determination theory (SDT) contains promising insights that can be leveraged in the design of these technologies; however, it remains unclear how this can be achieved. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a chatbot system that improves the user's autonomous motivation for walking based on BCTs and SDT. First, we aimed to develop and evaluate various versions of a chatbot system based on promising BCTs. Second, we aimed to evaluate whether the use of the system improves the autonomous motivation for walking and the associated factors of need satisfaction. Third, we explored the support for the theoretical mechanism and effectiveness of various BCT implementations. Methods: We developed a chatbot system using the mobile apps Telegram (Telegram Messenger Inc) and Google Fit (Google LLC). We implemented 12 versions of this system, which differed in 3 BCTs: goal setting, experimenting, and action planning. We then conducted a feasibility study with 102 participants who used this system over the course of 3 weeks, by conversing with a chatbot and completing questionnaires, capturing their perceived app support, need satisfaction, physical activity levels, and motivation. Results: The use of the chatbot systems was satisfactory, and on average, its users reported increases in autonomous motivation for walking. The dropout rate was low. Although approximately half of the participants indicated that they would have preferred to interact with a human instead of the chatbot, 46.1% (47/102) of the participants stated that the chatbot helped them become more active, and 42.2% (43/102) of the participants decided to continue using the chatbot for an additional week. Furthermore, the majority thought that a more advanced chatbot could be very helpful. The motivation was associated with the satisfaction of the needs of competence and autonomy, and need satisfaction, in turn, was associated with the perceived system support, providing support for SDT underpinnings. However, no substantial differences were found across different BCT implementations. Conclusions: The results provide evidence that chatbot systems are a feasible means to increase autonomous motivation for physical activity. We found support for SDT as a basis for the design, laying a foundation for larger studies to confirm the effectiveness of the selected BCTs within chatbot systems, explore a wider range of BCTs, and help the development of guidelines for the design of interactive technology that helps users achieve long-term health benefits. © JMIR Formative Research 2023.

AB  - The crucial role of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) is impacting traditional hiring and recruiting proce-dures. AI is one of the most notable trends from 2021. The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of social influence on the usage intention of the AI-based job application process using personal innovativeness and perceived trust as mediating variables. A descriptive cross-sectional online survey with 440 students from various South Indian universities revealed that social influence (SI) has a significant direct positive effect on the intention to use the AI-enabled job (IUAI) application process, and social influence has a significant direct positive effect on personal innovative-ness (PI). Personal innovativeness has a significant direct positive effect on the intention to use the AI-enabled job application process. Social influence has a significant direct positive effect on perceived trust (PT), and perceived trust has a significant direct positive effect on the intention to use the AI-enabled job application process. The study also dis-closed that personal innovativeness and perceived trust par-tially mediate social influence and the intention to use AI. It is proposed that various recruitment agencies incorporate the job application process using artificial intelligence for a smooth and effective recruitment process for the immense benefit of the stakeholders. Longitudinal research could also provide a more profound and generalised knowledge of using the AI-enabled job application process. The original-ity of the study opens a new and novel area for researchers, shedding light on job seekers’ perceptions of the AI-assisted job application process. It expands knowledge on how social persuasion, perceived trust, and personal innovativeness influence the likelihood of job seekers applying for jobs. The limitations of the study, implications for future research, and recommendations are also discussed. © 2022, WSB University. All rights reserved.

AB  - The recent development of industrial manufacturing and social services has witnessed a significant trend of automation and intelligentization due to the wide application of robots and the technology of artificial intelligence (AI). While robots liberate humans from tedious and dangerous work in hazardous environments, AI simplifies the programming of robots by automatically inferring patterns and models from the interaction between the robots and the environment. Nevertheless, the application of robots and AI to more general manufacturing and social tasks is still limited by the lack of flexibility and adaptability to the changes in the task and the environment. Thus, a new concept, adaptive robotics, has been proposed to address the desire that an AI-powered robot should be able to properly reprogram itself to these changes without human intervention. Nevertheless, this concept is yet too abstract to provide any specific guidance to the development of robot programs. In this paper, we attempt to provide methodical redefinition and reformulation of adaptive robotics both in conceptual and mathematical manners based on the study of previous results. First of all, we introduce the essential motivation and the conceptual origination of adaptability of mechanical systems. Then, we review the previous literature and explore the related work of adaptive robotics. Based on this, we provide a uniform mathematical formulation of adaptive robotics based on adaptive and robust Markov-decision process (MDP). Through this work, we attempt to inspire the generic framework of adaptive robotics incorporating the existing immature paradigms, by which we are aiming at a clarified and well-defined context of adaptive robotics for future research on related domains. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - When residential rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems are widely accepted across society, the uptake of home battery energy storage systems is closely tied to the PV-status quo and the behaviour previously taken by households. This study proposes that a decision of acceptance or rejection of PV systems is the past behaviour of the battery adoption decision. This antecedent role of PV behaviour may spark two attitudinal changes: (a) feelings of regret, which may occur among PV adopters, stemming from a positive experience of using the system, or among non-adopters due to their rejection of the system, and (b) feelings of despair, which may arise among current PV users due to dissatisfaction and discontent with the system. While regret positively changes consumers’ attitude towards battery adoption expediting an earlier purchase, despair could preclude battery installation. Through a survey of 557 households in South East Queensland, Australia, this study investigated factors driving attitude change. Instead of traditional statistical methods, machine learning algorithms were adopted to derive data-driven models of attitude change, allowing for higher prediction accuracy and a determination of the latent causalities. The main findings indicate that perceived attitudes towards financial and non-financial benefits, followed by informal peers, best estimate the attitude change, whereas traditional sociodemographic factors, knowledge and affordability may not engender a shift. Leveraging from this new paradigm can encourage current PV consumers to take another step and become earlier battery adopters. Failure to recognise these dynamics may breed despair and turn current innovators and early adopters of PVs into late adopters or rejectors of battery systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Commercial smartphone apps that promote self-monitoring of weight loss are widely available. The development of disease-specific apps has begun, but there is no app for specific health guidance (SHG) to prevent metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases in middle-aged adults in Japan. Objective: This study aimed to determine the efficacy of an SHG mobile health app in facilitating weight loss in Japanese adults with obesity and hypertension. Methods: In a 12-week, statistician-blinded, randomized parallel controlled trial, 78 overweight and obese men aged 40-69 years were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to either the usual support plus KENPO-app group (intervention group) or the active control group. KENPO-app (release April 10, 2019; OMRON Healthcare Co., Ltd.) was developed by the study team and focus groups and uses behavior change techniques (ie, self-monitoring and goal-setting theory). This app was developed for SHG based on the four specific health checkups and guidance system in Japan: (1) focusing primarily on achieving the target (weight loss of ≥2 kg); (2) assessing healthy eating, exercise habits, smoking habits, relaxation, and self-weighing; (3) providing information on the results of specific health checkups; and (4) starting an intervention period of 6 months with the interim assessment at 3 months. The initial assessment explored the following: personality traits (4 types), health checkup data concerns (10 items), symptom concerns (10 items), and the aim of the intervention (weight loss, improving fitness, symptoms, laboratory data). Chatbot-supported health information on health and health behavior was selected from 392 quizzes based on app data and was provided to participants. The KENPO-app had chatbot-supported feedback and information provision combined with a self-monitoring tool (weight, steps, and blood pressure). Data on active exercise, healthy eating, and healthy lifestyle habits were obtained using a web-based self-administered questionnaire at baseline and 12 weeks. Results: The trial’s retention rate was 95% (74/78). The adherence to daily self-weighing, wearing the pedometer, and blood pressure monitoring in the KENPO-app group was significantly higher than those in the active control group. Compared with the active control group, the median body weight and BMI of the intervention group significantly decreased at 3 months (–0.4, IQR –2.0 to 0.6 kg vs –1.1, IQR –2.7 to –0.5 kg; P=.03; –0.1, IQR –0.6 to 0.3 kg vs –0.4, IQR –0.8 to –0.2 kg; P=.02, respectively). The intervention increased the percentage of participants who self-reported taking ≥8000 steps, eating vegetables before rice, eating slowly, and relaxing. Personality traits were associated with the degree of weight loss in the intervention group. Conclusions: The SHG-specific KENPO-app was feasible and induced modest but significant weight loss in adults with obesity. © Naoki Sakane, Akiko Suganuma, Masayuki Domichi, Shin Sukino, Keiko Abe, Akiyoshi Fujisaki, Ai Kanazawa, Mamiko Sugimoto.

AB  - As the obesity rate continues to increase persistently, there is an urgent need to develop an effective weight loss management strategy. Nowadays, the development of artificial intelligence (AI) and cognitive technologies coupled with the rapid spread of messaging platforms and mobile technology with easier access to internet technology offers professional dietitians an opportunity to provide extensive monitoring support to their clients through a chatbot with artificial empathy. This study aimed to design a chatbot with artificial empathic motivational support for weight loss called “SlimMe” and investigate how people react to a diet bot. The SlimMe infrastructure was built using Dialogflow as the natural language processing (NLP) platform and LINE mobile messenger as the messaging platform. We proposed a text-based emotion analysis to simulate artificial empathy responses to recognize the user's emotion. A preliminary evaluation was performed to investigate the early-stage user experience after a 7-day simulation trial. The result revealed that having an artificially empathic diet bot for weight loss management is a fun and exciting experience. The use of emoticons, stickers, and GIF images makes the chatbot response more interactive. Moreover, the motivational support and persuasive messaging features enable the bot to express more empathic and engaging responses to the user. In total, there were 1,007 bot responses from 892 user input messages. Of these, 67.38% (601/1,007) of the chatbot-generated responses were accurate to a relevant user request, 21.19% (189/1,007) inaccurate responses to a relevant request, and 10.31% (92/1,007) accurate responses to an irrelevant request. Only 1.12% (10/1,007) of the chatbot does not answer. We present the design of an artificially empathic diet bot as a friendly assistant to help users estimate their calorie intake and calories burned in a more interactive and engaging way. To our knowledge, this is the first chatbot designed with artificial empathy features, and it looks very promising in promoting long-term weight management. More user interactions and further data training and validation enhancement will improve the bot's in-built knowledge base and emotional intelligence base.

AB  - The currently used educational technology with artificial-intelligence-powered solutions, although rather instrumental, may lead to discontinuity in learning, as it lacks social and emotional value, which is an essential part of education for sustainable development and results in an immersive experience through which higher-order thinking skills can be adopted. This paper aims to explore transformative learning (TL) and innovation skill improvement accommodated by transactional distance theory in a 16-week remote sustainable architecture design course. The analysis identified the following: (a) significant progress in students’ attitudes toward uncertainty and criticality while social support differs due to the influence of classmates, faculty staff, teamwork, writing and reading assignments, promoters from industry and extracurricular activities; (b) significant progress in TL achievement while innovation skill development differs significantly across the groups in which online collaborative learning was found as an influencer in creativity and motivation; (c) self-efficacy influenced by feedback in and on actions, such as essay and other writing assignments, verbal persuasions and positive social comparisons; (d) lack of development of situational awareness, continuity of learning and interactions/situations to empower teammates in handling conflicts to develop leadership ability; (e) decrease in risk-taking ability, especially in a group of students in which social support was limited due to the absence of challenging situations and tasks. The results support the use of remote intervention directed at prosocial motivations and action-focused group goals. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The use of intelligent virtual agents (IVA) to support humans in social contexts will depend on their social acceptability. Acceptance will be related to the human’s perception of the IVAs as well as the IVAs’ ability to respond and adapt their conversation appropriately to the human. Adaptation implies computer-generated speech (synthetic speech), such as text-to-speech (TTS). In this paper, we present the results of a study to investigate the effect of voice type (human voice vs. synthetic voice) on two aspects: (1) the IVA’s likeability and voice impression in the light of co-presence, and (2) the interaction outcome, including human–agent trust and behavior change intention. The experiment included 118 participants who interacted with either the virtual advisor with TTS or the virtual advisor with human voice to gain tips for reducing their study stress. Participants in this study found the voice of the virtual advisor with TTS to be more eerie, but they rated both agents, with recorded voice and with TTS, similarly in terms of likeability. They further showed a similar attitude towards both agents in terms of co-presence and building trust. These results challenge previous studies that favor human voice over TTS, and suggest that even if human voice is preferred, TTS can deliver equivalent benefits. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have shown potential benefits in managing healthy behavior. This paper presents a systematic review of AR- or VR-driven interventions for promoting healthy behaviors. The review investigates the design, implementations of the intervention, persuasive strategies, intervention platforms, underlying technologies, current trends, and research gaps. Our review of the past 10-years' work in the area reveals that 1) the considered papers focused on seven main healthy behaviors, where "alcohol use"emerged as the most commonly considered behavior; 2) trustworthiness emerged as the most commonly used persuasive strategy; 3) youth are the most targeted audience; 4) VR is more common than AR; and 5) most AR- or VR-driven interventions are perceived to be effective in motivating healthy behavior in people. We also uncover how they use Artificial Intelligence and Object Tracking in this space. Finally, we identify gaps and offer recommendations for advancing research in this area.  © 2022 ACM.

AB  - Recently, Altay et al. (Altay et al. 2021. J. Exp.Psychol.: Appl. (doi:10.1037/xap0000400)) showed that 5 min of interaction with a chatbot led to increases in positive COVID-19 vaccination attitudes and intentions in a French population. Here we replicate this effect in a vaccine-hesitant, UK-based population. We attempt to isolate what made the chatbot condition effective by controlling the amount of information provided, the trustworthiness of the information and the level of interactivity. Like Altay et al., our experiment allowed participants to navigate a branching dialogue by choosing questions of interest about COVID-19 vaccines. Our control condition used the same questions and answers but removed participant choice by presenting the dialogues at random. Importantly, we also targeted those who were either against or neutral towards COVID-19 vaccinations to begin with, screening-out those with already positive attitudes. Replicating Altay et al., we found a similar size increase in positive attitudes towards vaccination, and in intention to get vaccinated. Unlike Altay et al., we found no difference between our two conditions: choosing the questions did not increase vaccine attitudes or intentions any more than our control condition. These results suggest that the attitudes of the vaccine hesitant are modifiable with exposure to in-depth, trustworthy and engaging dialogues.  © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Predicting lane-changing behaviour is an integral part of lane-changing decision models and has a significant impact on both traffic flow characteristics and traffic safety. A variety of lane-changing decision models have been developed for this purpose, with most of them focussing only on explaining lane-changing behaviour, while assessing the predictive capability of these models has comparatively received less attention. Meanwhile, machine learning techniques are often preferred for prediction purposes, but their application to predicting lane-changing behaviour is limited. However, the lack of interpretability of machine learning techniques is often criticised and needs a solution. Motivated by these research needs, this study explains and predicts driver's mandatory and discretionary lane-changing behaviours using a set of suitable machine learning techniques. Input features are objectively selected using the technique of Recursive Feature Elimination, and standard classification metrics are employed to select the best model. By accounting for class imbalance, this study finds that the Extra Trees classifier outperforms other machine learning techniques as well as a conventional utility theory-based model in predicting lane-changing behaviour. Furthermore, by keeping the model hyperparameters unchanged, this classifier shows good transferability in predicting lane-changing behaviour when tested on a completely new dataset. Finally, through explainable artificial intelligence, the output of the Extra Trees classifier is interpreted. The findings of this study advocate the use of machine learning techniques in future studies for explaining and predicting lane-changing behaviour. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper uses a Tavesian model of religious experience to make a modest theorization about the role of “fabulation”, an embodied and affective process, to understand how some contemporary AI and robotics designers and users consider encounters with these technologies to be spiritually “authorizing”. By “fabulation”, we mean the Bergsonian concept of an evolved capacity that allows humans to see the potentialities of complex action within another object—in other words, an interior agential image, or “soul”; and by “authorizing”, we mean “deemed as having some claim to arbitration, persuasion, and legitimacy” such that the user might make choices that affect their life or others in accordance with the AI or might have their spiritual needs met. We considered two case studies where this agency took on a spiritual or religious valence when contextualized as such for the user: a robotic Buddhist priest known as Mindar, and a chatbot called The Spirituality Chatbot. We show how understanding perceptions of AI or robots as being spiritual or religious in a way that authorizes behavioral changes requires understanding tendencies of the human body more so than it does any metaphysical nature of the technology itself. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To describe the use of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled dark nudges by leading global food and beverage companies to influence consumer behaviour. Design: The five most recent annual reports (ranging from 2014 to 2018 or 2015 to 2019, depending on the company) and websites from twelve of the leading companies in the global food and beverage industry were reviewed to identify uses of AI and emerging technologies to influence consumer behaviour. Uses of AI and emerging technologies were categorised according to the Typology of Interventions in Proximal Physical Micro-Environments (TIPPME) framework, a tool for categorising and describing nudge-type behaviour change interventions (which has also previously been used to describe dark nudge-type approaches used by the alcohol industry). Setting: Not applicable. Participants: Twelve leading companies in the global food and beverage industry. Results: Text was extracted from fifty-seven documents from eleven companies. AI-enabled dark nudges used by food and beverage companies included those that altered products and objects' availability (e.g. social listening to inform product development), position (e.g. decision technology and facial recognition to manipulate the position of products on menu boards), functionality (e.g. decision technology to prompt further purchases based on current selections) and presentation (e.g. augmented or virtual reality to deliver engaging and immersive marketing). Conclusions: Public health practitioners and policymakers must understand and engage with these technologies and tactics if they are to counter industry promotion of products harmful to health, particularly as investment by the industry in AI and other emerging technologies suggests their use will continue to grow.  ©

AB  - Stress has become one of the major reasons for many mental health related issues among students of all age groups, which has resulted in devastating personal losses including suicide. Societal and familial pressure to succeed is high, particularly in developing countries where education is highly valued as a key enabler. As part of stress management during the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for online intelligent virtual advisors has risen and, consequently, the need for personalised explanation that is culturally sensitive to the user's context is essential to improve the user's understanding of and trust in the recommendations provided by the virtual advisor. This paper presents the mAnaging stRess at University embodied conversational agent (ECA) that has been adapted for Indian university students from an explainable agent that was found to help Western students reduce their stress by providing study tips with explanations based on the student's beliefs and/or goals. We conducted a research study with sixty students which measured the impact of providing three different patterns of tailored explanations (belief-based, goal-based, and belief and goal-based explanation) on the students' intentions to change the recommended behaviours and the relationship built with the ECA. The experimental results indicate that there was stress reduction across all student groups provided with different types of explanations. Further, the students showed trust and a good working alliance with the conversational agent, along with an intention to change behaviour across all types of explanations. However, it was observed that the user context played an important role in behaviour change intention and hence explanations could be tailored further, making them culturally more relevant to Indian students. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) have been mostly developed, applied and shown to be effective in developed countries. Hence, their design and development are mostly guided by the intended user's needs and preferences. In a Western context, ECAs have been found to be beneficial for reducing study stress in university students. There is a pertinent need for use of low cost, effective technology that can aid academic stress reduction in higher educational institutions in developing countries owing to their high youth populations, lack of adequate mental healthcare facilities and associated social stigma. What this paper adds The adaptation and use of ECAs to reduce study stress in higher education students in a developing country is evaluated. The ECA technology is adapted for an Indian context in terms of its physical appearance, colour, speech dialect and dialog content so that it is culturally more aligned to the target population. The ECA engages in an empathic conversation tailored for the Indian students and their COVID-19 context providing them with explanation-backed behaviour recommendations that take their beliefs and goals into account. The ECA provides three types of explanation: belief-only; goal-only; and both belief and goal. Results of a study carried out in an Indian university with 61 students, randomly assigned to one of the explanation types, to capture their demographics, study stress statistics, behaviour change intentions and trust/working alliance with the conversational agent. The major findings include stress reduction across all explanation groups, development of a positive relationship between the ECA and the students regardless of its explanation pattern, and changes in behaviour intentions across all types of explanations for all recommended behaviours. However, differences in change intentions for certain behaviours indicate further tailoring of explanations is required based on the user context. Implications for practice and/or policy The ECA technology has shown promise in terms of stress reduction amongst Indian students. Higher Education Institutions in developing countries could utilise low-cost and widely accessible ECAs to overcome lack of access to human-based support and reluctance to use available services due to stigmatized attitudes to mental health issues. This technology can be further improved and deployed into a larger number of Indian educational institutions leading to a widespread impact on overall student health and wellbeing. Digital technologies to support mental health have become more prominent during the COVID-19 pandemic, at least in Western countries. The ECA technology evaluated in our study demonstrates its viability and potential value for use in developing countries, with appropriate tailoring. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - This paper proposes a framework for improving information security behaviours using ChatGPT, a natural language processing chatbot. The framework leverages the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) and the Persuasion Theory to promote secure behaviours through targeted interventions such as education, training, gamification, security tips, reminders, and nudges. ChatGPT can provide personalized and interactive training on information security best practices, deliver relevant threat alerts and tips, and assist with security assessments. Gamification can be used to increase engagement and retention of information security knowledge. The use of nudges and reminders can help sustain secure behaviours over time. Overall, the ChatGPT framework offers a promising approach for organizations looking to enhance their cybersecurity posture by promoting a culture of information security and empowering individuals with the knowledge and tools to protect sensitive information. The framework was then validated by prompting ChatGPT to raise awareness. The responses were then validated by experts to verify if the content from ChatGPT was good. © 2023, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - The present paper proposes a new application of the prediction of human behavior using TOPSIS as an appropriate tool for data optimization. Our hypothesis was that the analysis of the candidates with this method was influenced by the change of their behavior. We found that the behavior change could occur in more than one time span when the behavior of two candidates changed simultaneously. One of the advantages of this study is that the pattern of the behavior change with time is predicted with this method. Another advantage is that the modifications in the TOPSIS algorithm have made the predictions independent from the need of changing the fuzzy membership degrees of the candidates. This is the first time that these modifications in this technique with a new application including the numerical analysis of cognitive date are reported. Our results can be used in cognitive science, experimental psychology, cognitive informatics and artificial intelligence. © 2022, Research Expansion Alliance (REA). All rights reserved.

AB  - This book, geared towards both students and professionals, examines the synthesis of artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology in detecting mis-/disinformation in digital media content, and suggests practical means to intervene and curtail this current global 'infodemic'. This interdisciplinary book explores technological, psychological, philosophical, and linguistic insights into the nature of truth and deception, trust and credibility, cognitive biases and logical fallacies and how, through AI and human intervention, content users can be alerted to the presence of deception. The author investigates how AI can mimic the procedures and know-hows of humans, showing how AI can help spot fakes and how AI tools can work to debunk rumors and fact-check. The book describes how AI detection systems work and how they fit with broader societal and individual concerns. Each chapter focuses attention on key concepts and their inter-connection. The first part of the book seeks theoretical footing to understand our interactions with new information and reviews relevant empirical findings in behavioral sciences. The second part is about applied knowledge. The author looks at several known practices that guard us against deception, and provides several real-world examples of manipulative persuasive techniques in advertising, political propaganda, and public relations. She provides links to the downloadable executable files to three AI applications (clickbait, satire, and falsehood detectors) via LiT.RL GitHub, an open access repository. The book is useful to students and professionals studying AI and media studies as well as library and information professionals. Examines how artificial intelligence (AI) and psychology can aid in detecting mis-/disinformation and the language of deceit in digital media content; Suggests practical computational means to intervene and curtail the global 'infodemic' of fake news; Presents how AI can sift, sort, and shuffle digital content, to reduce the amount of content needed to be reviewed by humans. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

AB  - Unhealthy diets are a critical global concern while dietary measure methods are time consuming and expensive. There is limited evidence that phone-based interventions can improve nutrition data collection and dietary quality, especially for adolescents in developing countries. We developed an artificial-intelligence-based phone application called Food Recognition Assistance and Nudging Insights (FRANI) to address these problems. FRANI can recognize foods in images, track food consumption, display statistics and use gamified nudges to give positive feedback on healthy food choice. This study protocol describes the design of new pilot studies aimed at measuring the feasibility (acceptability, adherence, and usability) of FRANI and its effects on the quality of food choice of adolescents in Ghana and Vietnam. In each country, 36 adolescents (12–18 years) will be randomly allocated into two groups: The intervention group with the full version of FRANI and the control group with the functionality limited to image recognition and dietary assessment. Participants in both groups will have their food choices tracked for four weeks. The control groups will then switch to the full version of FRANI and both groups will be tracked for a further 2 weeks to assess acceptability, adherence, and usability. Analysis of outcomes will be by intent to treat and differences in outcomes between intervention and control group will use Poisson and odds ratio regression models, accounting for repeated measures at individual levels. If deemed feasible, acceptable and usable, FRANI will address gaps in the literature and advance the nutrition field by potentially improving the quality of food choices of adolescent girls in developing countries. This pilot study will also provide insights on the design of a large randomized controlled trial. The functioning and dissemination of FRANI can be an important step towards highly scalable nutrition data collection and healthier food choices for a population at risk of malnutrition.

AB  - Background: Consumer and advanced consumption culture in modern society is an era that focuses on individual personality and value, and “my own customized products”, or customized marketing strategies, are actively being developed throughout the industry. Recently, IT technologies that can support personalized services such as artificial intelligence, ubiquitous systems, and marketing automation have been recognized for their potential, directly or indirectly affecting distribution industries affected by personal consumption culture. Accordingly, customized products or services, i.e., customization, are attracting attention as an effective methodology to cope with such market changes. Objectives: Among the necessities used by modern women, cosmetics account for an endless interest in beauty and maintaining physical and mental health, and as the cosmetics market expands, it is considered that the cosmetics industry needs a clearer and in-depth study on the cosmetics submarket to satisfy consumers' diverse needs. Methods: This review paper is a literature review, and a narrative review approach has been used for this study. A total of 300 to 400 references were selected using representative journal search websites such as PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, ResearchGate, LitCovid, DBPia, and RISS, of which a total of 42 papers were selected in the final stage based on 2013 to 2022 using PRISMA flow diagram. Results: This study suggested to indicate the changes in the cosmetics market due to the emergence of cosmetics curation services after the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic, advanced changes in consumer purchase patterns following the 4th Industrial Revolution, and significant future prospects of cosmetics curation services. Conclusion: As the beauty and cosmetology industry is expected to develop in the future, it will grow as a centerpiece of the beauty industry and symbolizes nationalized cultural pride. Therefore, this review article will be continuing to promote customization as a premium beauty service for dermatological condition in Republic of Korea through corporate analysis. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - When modeling life-like Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), conveying politeness through verbal and nonverbal behaviors with persuasive intents is a significant challenge, as it underlies the conventional set of behavioral rules that govern human communication. In the present study, we explore the adherence to such rules in the context of joining a small, freestanding conversational group of agents in VR. In particular, we focus on the behavior adopted by participants while walking towards the agents, and on whether ECAs were treated in the same way human agents normally are. 45 test subjects were invited by an ECA to walk towards the group by applying one of six possible politeness strategies; after freely joining the group, they were asked to rate the agent's politeness according to four distinct aspects (Clarity, Face loss, Positive face, and Negative face). Across all strategies, in 48% of the trials participants were successfully persuaded to join the group at an inconvenient location. Out of those trials, participants adhered to social conventions by not crossing the convex empty space between the group members (o-space) in 75% of them on average. Additionally, analysis of verbal and nonverbal behaviors in ECAs shows that direct request strategies are more effective than indirect ones, although in some cases they may be perceived as less polite.  © 2022 Owner/Author.

AB  - Artificial intelligence-driven robots are increasingly being introduced in various workplaces. Research implies that people’s negative attitudes toward intelligent and collaborative robots might hinder their willingness to use them. We propose that interactive educational activities such as specialized workshops help people to overcome such negative attitudes. We designed a two-day workshop that introduced two quasi-industrial robots (Poppy Ergo Jr and ClearBot) to 16 university students. Students’ attitudes were qualitatively measured before and after the workshop. The results imply that the workshop helped students to increase their understanding of the nature of the intelligent collaborative robots. More precisely, robots became to be seen as empowering tools, rather than friends or enemies. Interestingly, there were significant gender differences, as the female participants had a greater tendency to view robots as animated objects. We concluded that specialized workshops effectively lead participants to become aware of various promising opportunities for their robotic co-workers in the possible future. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - These updated guidelines present a practical and logical approach to the assessment and management of acute and chronic pain in canine and feline patients. Recognizing pain is fundamental to successful treatment, and diagnostic guides and algorithms are included for assessment of both acute and chronic pain. Particularly for chronic pain, capturing owner evaluation is important, and pain-assessment instruments for pet owners are described. Expert consensus emphasizes proactive, preemptive pain management rather than a reactive, "damage control"approach. The guidelines discuss treatment options centered on preemptive, multimodal analgesic therapies. There is an extensive variety of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for the management of acute and chronic pain in cats and dogs. The guidelines include a tiered decision tree that prioritizes the use of the most efficacious therapeutic modalities for the treatment of acute and chronic pain.  © 2022 by American Animal Hospital Association.

AB  - This study explores the effects of gender stereotypes on evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) recommendations. We predict that gender stereotypes will affect human-AI interactions, resulting in somewhat different persuasive effects of AI recommendations for utilitarian vs. hedonic products. We found that participants in the male AI agent condition gave higher competence scores than in the female AI agent condition. Contrariwise, perceived warmth was higher in the female AI agent condition than in the male condition. More importantly, a significant interaction effect between AI gender and product type was found, suggesting that participants showed more positive attitudes toward the AI recommendations when the male AI recommended a utilitarian (vs. hedonic) product. Conversely, a hedonic product was evaluated more positively when advised by the female (vs. male) AI agent. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - COVID-19 non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) are changing human mobility patterns; however, the effects on power systems remain unclear. Previous loads and timings along with weather features are often used in literature as input features in load forecasting, but these may be insufficient during COVID-19. As a result, this paper proposes an analytical framework to assess the impact of COVID-19 on power system operation as well as day-ahead electricity prices in Ireland. To improve peak demand forecasting during pandemics, we incorporate mobility, NPIs, and COVID-19 cases as complementary input features and representative of human behaviour changes. By defining different combinations of these explanatory features, several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are applied and their performance is compared with the baseline scenario currently used in the literature. Using SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), we interpret the best performing model, Light Gradient Boosted Machine, to determine the influence of each feature on the predicted outcomes. We discover that typical load forecasting features still influence ML outcomes the most, but mobility-related changes are also significant. Our finding shows that NPIs impact human behaviour and electricity consumption during times of crisis and can be used in the context of load forecasting to assist policymakers and energy distributors.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Although conversational agents (CA) are increasingly used for providing purchase recommendations, important design questions remain. Across two experiments we examine with a novel fluency mechanism how recommendation modality (speech vs. text) shapes recommendation evaluation (persuasiveness and risk), the intention to follow the recommendation, and how modality interacts with the style of recommendation explanation (verbal vs. numerical). Findings provide robust evidence that text-based CAs outperform speech-based CAs in terms of processing fluency and consumer responses. They show that numerical explanations increase processing fluency and purchase intention of both recommendation modalities. The results underline the importance of processing fluency for the decision to follow a recommendation and highlight that processing fluency can be actively shaped through design decisions in terms of implementing the right modality and aligning it with the optimal explanation style. For practice, we offer actionable implications on how to make effective sales agents out of CAs. © 2022 International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2022: "Digitization for the Next Generation".

AB  - Traditional medical practices and relationships are changing given the widespread adoption of AI-driven technologies across the various domains of health and healthcare. In many cases, these new technologies are not specific to the field of healthcare. Still, they are existent, ubiquitous, and commercially available systems upskilled to integrate these novel care practices. Given the widespread adoption, coupled with the dramatic changes in practices, new ethical and social issues emerge due to how these systems nudge users into making decisions and changing behaviours. This article discusses how these AI-driven systems pose particular ethical challenges with regards to nudging. To confront these issues, the value sensitive design (VSD) approach is adopted as a principled methodology that designers can adopt to design these systems to avoid harming and contribute to the social good. The AI for Social Good (AI4SG) factors are adopted as the norms constraining maleficence. In contrast, higher-order values specific to AI, such as those from the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, are adopted as the values to be promoted as much as possible in design. The use case of Amazon Alexa's Healthcare Skills is used to illustrate this design approach. It provides an exemplar of how designers and engineers can begin to orientate their design programs of these technologies towards the social good. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This research explores the explicit requirements to design and develop ICTbased learning solutions for children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). A requirement elicitation study has been conducted for six weeks of the study’s in Pune, India. The study sample size is fifteen (N=15), with an age limit between five to twelve years old. All the participants have been diagnosed with ASD and undergoing a skills development process in the same institution for at least six months. The outcomes of this research are tri-fold. Firstly, identify the twelve explicit requirements to design and develop ICT-based learning solutions considering the challenges due to autism. Secondly, conformity to the existing Multi Agent based Persuasive Education (MAPE) model with revealed requirements. Thirdly, propose an Internet of Things (IoT) based framework to observe and record the learning performance of ASD-affected children. The unique contribution of this study is to develop a Level-5 IoT framework to incorporate the requirements revealed through the participatory design approach for implementing ICT-based learning solutions. The proposed framework forms the basis for developing a dataset to identify the learning patterns and new requirements for ASD-affected children through Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). © 2022 Authors.

AB  - Persuasive technologies (PTs) for promoting physical activity (PA) have experienced widespread attention over the years. However, limited knowledge exists on how best to design and match individuals in cooperative or social-based physical activity PTs to achieve the best outcome. It is established that people in the same group influence each other’s behaviours. Although few group formation techniques have been proposed in the literature, none of these techniques consider individuals’ normal PA levels in the real-world prior to assigning them to groups as a dimension to inform group formation. In this paper, we propose a group formation approach called Performance-based User Matching (PUM) which is based on the hypothesis that assigning users with similar PA levels to the same group (SG) will increase motivation and collective performance, compared to grouping users with dissimilar or mixed PA levels (MG). We empirically validated this approach in an exergaming context by conducting a 6-week field study using a persuasive exergame we developed to investigate and compare the SG and MG paradigms in terms of PA performance (step counts). Our findings show that players in the SG groups significantly increased their PA levels compared to those in the MG groups. Also, players in the SG groups individually and collectively exceeded their baseline steps during the intervention period, compared to those in the MG groups. Our findings hold promises for adaptive user matching and socially-driven persuasive applications design. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) suffer most in communication and behavioral aspect which hampers their regular basic education and cognitive development. Technological development enhanced a lot in every sector where educational sector is no exception of that. The cognitive development of the children with ASD can be taken care of effectively by using of advanced information technology. This study has focused on the prospect of designing the digital learning platform for the children with ASD to fulfill the existing research gap for developing persuasive learning mechanism for the children with ASD. This study has proposed an agent-based model for developing a persuasive learning tool where Sanket is an agent of a touch screen based application which pursues the children with ASD regarding the learning of basic education (numbers, alphabets), which forms a basis to enable Artificial Intelligence for automation of the learning process and help the children with ASD.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Research has shown that dynamic norm information can promote pro-environmental actions (i.e. information indicating that a growing number of people are behaving pro-environmentally). Yet, the question remains whether adding dynamic norm information would increase the effectiveness of information on the environmental consequences of behavior. We compared the effects of environmental information with versus without dynamic norm information on encouraging reductions in meat consumption, and whether effects would depend on receivers’ intrinsic motivation. We also explored whether message effectiveness would vary according to receivers’ intrinsic motivation to reduce meat consumption. In total 197 volunteers participated in a one-month messaging intervention through a chatbot. Results showed that both environmental and environmental + dynamic norm messages increased positive attitude towards reducing meat consumption, and decreased meat consumption. These effects were still present at follow-up (i.e. one month after the intervention stopped). Interestingly, both messages particularly persuaded receivers with a relatively weak intrinsic motivation to reduce meat consumption, while environmental only messages were even counterproductive in receivers with a relatively strong intrinsic motivation. These results advance our comprehension of the effects of messages aimed at reducing meat consumption. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The growing burden from osteoporosis and fragility fractures highlights a need to improve osteoporosis management across healthcare systems. Sub-optimal management of osteoporosis is an area suitable for digital health interventions. While fracture liaison services (FLSs) are proven to greatly improve care for people with osteoporosis, such services might benefit from technologies that enhance automation. The term ‘Digital Health’ covers a variety of different tools including clinical decision support systems, electronic medical record tools, patient decision aids, patient apps, education tools, and novel artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Within the scope of this review are AI solutions that use algorithms within health system registries to target interventions. Clinician-targeted, patient-targeted, or system-targeted digital health interventions could be used to improve management and prevent fragility fractures. This review was commissioned by The Royal Osteoporosis Society and Bone Research Academy during the production of the 2020 Research Roadmap (https://theros.org.uk), with the intention of identifying gaps where targeted research funding could lead to improved patient health. We explore potential uses of digital technology in the general management of osteoporosis. Evidence suggests that digital technologies can support multidisciplinary teams to provide the best possible patient care based on current evidence and to support patients in self-management. However, robust randomised controlled studies are still needed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of these technologies. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - In negotiation dialogue tasks, opponents may use various strategies. Such negotiations are challenging because our chatbot needs to be able to detect the behavior change and then to adapt its own policy accordingly. Moreover, instead of adopting stationary strategies, a more advanced opponent may demonstrate sophisticated behaviors by employing reasoning strategies to predict its opponent behavior. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel chatbot for negotiation dialogues, which leverages the predictive power of Bayesian policy reuse (BPR) and the recursive reasoning ability of theory of mind (ToM). BPR can help the chatbot efficiently detect strategies of an opponent and select the best response policy, and ToM can efficiently identify whether an opponent is using stationary or higher-level reasoning strategies to improve policy selection. The performance of the proposed chatbot is evaluated on the CRAIGSLISTBARGAIN dataset against state-of-the-art baselines. The experimental results show that it outperforms existing agents on the task, and is also able to make efficient detection and optimal response against state-of-the-art baselines. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to design and implement an intelligent online proctoring system (IOPS) by using the advantage of artificial intelligence technology in order to monitor the online exam, which is urgently needed in online learning settings worldwide. As a pilot application, the authors used this system in an authentic university online exam and checked the proctoring result. Design/methodology/approach: The IOPS adopts the B/S (Browser/Server) architecture. The server side is implemented with programming language C and Python and stores the identification data of all examinees and their important behavior change status, including facial expression, eye and mouth movement and speech. The browser side collects and analyzes multimodal data of the examinee writing the online test locally and transfers the examinee’s most important behavior status change data to the server. Real-time face recognition and voice detection are implemented with the support of open-source software. Findings: The system was integrated into a Web-based intelligent tutoring system for school mathematics education. As a pilot application, the system was also used for online proctored exam in an undergraduate seminar in Peking University during the epidemic period in 2020. The recorded log data show that all students concentrated themselves on the exam and did not leave the camera and did not speak. Originality/value: During the epidemic period of the novel coronavirus outbreak, almost all educational institutions in the world use online learning as the best way to maintain the teaching and learning schedule for all students. However, current online instruction platforms lack the function to prevent the learners from cheating in online exams and cannot guarantee the integrity and equality for all examinees as in traditional classroom exams. The literature review shows that the online proctoring system should become an important component of online exams to tackle the growing online cheating problem. Although such proctoring systems have been developed and put on the market, the practical usage of such systems in authentic exams and its effect have not been reported. Those systems are heavyweight and commercial product and cannot be freely used in education. The light-weight IOPS developed by the authors could meet the need for online exam as a stable and practical approach and could contribute to the growing online learning and distance learning. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Human-induced climate change and deterioration of our natural environment are critical problems. Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI), offer potential for the development of solutions. Machines that learn by acquiring knowledge and perform human-like tasks can help humans reduce their intense use of natural resources and improve environmental governance for more sustainable living. This chapter provides evidence of AI’s potential to create new opportunities to overcome major socioenvironmental challenges, using two case studies. The first case study explains how machine intelligence can support the design and implementation of interventions for promoting proenvironmental behavior in societies. The next section discusses AI-powered strategies for efficient management of wildfires and renewable energy production. The conclusions offer insights into the ability of AI to influence larger trends in global sustainability and suggest data-driven interventions and leadership strategies to accelerate progress in combating climate change. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this paper, we use a pseudo-algorithmic procedure for assessing an AI-generated text. We apply the Comprehensive Assessment Procedure for Natural Argumentation (CAPNA) in evaluating the arguments produced by an Artificial Intelligence text generator, GPT-3, in an opinion piece written for the Guardian newspaper. The CAPNA examines instances of argumentation in three aspects: their Process, Reasoning and Expression. Initial Analysis is conducted using the Argument Type Identification Procedure (ATIP) to establish, firstly, that an argument is present and, secondly, its specific type in terms of the argument classification framework of the Periodic Table of Arguments (PTA). Procedural Questions are then used to test the acceptability of the argument in each of the three aspects. The analysis shows that while the arguments put forward by the AI text generator are varied in terms of their type and follow familiar patterns of human reasoning, they contain obvious weaknesses. From this we can conclude that the automated generation of persuasive, well-reasoned argumentation is a far more difficult task than the generation of meaningful language, and that if AI systems producing arguments are to be persuasive, they require a method of checking the plausibility of their own output.  © 2023 - The authors.

AB  - Background: Communication campaigns using social media can raise public awareness; however, they are difficult to sustain. A barrier is the need to generate and constantly post novel but on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck. Objective: In this study, we aim to harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a pilot system that can generate many candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign to suggest novel, on-topic candidate messages. The issue of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example; however, the system can work with other issues that could benefit from higher levels of public awareness. Methods: We used the Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine-tuned it using a data set of autodownloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine-tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is, to create new messages about this topic. We conducted a web-based study to gauge how human raters evaluate AI-generated tweet messages compared with original, human-crafted messages. Results: We found that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Web-based raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a human-curated sample of AI-generated messages as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results showed that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for web-based campaigns that focus on promoting awareness. Conclusions: The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for the quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage. © Ralf Schmälzle, Shelby Wilcox.

AB  - Health apps, including consumer-oriented fitness apps, have two functions. They are supposed to monitor and promote users’ health, the latter by way of being an instance of persuasive technology. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) allows for AI health apps, i.e., health apps that act more and more autonomously when it comes to analyzing users’ health data and arriving at tailor-made results on how to improve their health. Consequently, AI health apps seem to gain a paternalistic potential. This is a game-changer, for corresponding issues of paternalism can then no longer be traced back to human engineers. Instead, the paternalizing party just is the AI system. Hence, AI health apps lead to the novel issue of AI paternalism in health care. In this paper, I explore this novel phenomenon and its ethical implications. Firstly, I discuss from a critical perspective whether the notion of AI paternalism makes (conceptual) sense to begin with. Unsurprisingly, I argue that it does and how so. Secondly, I briefly indicate important ethical issues that AI paternalism in health apps raise and which need to be discussed in more detail in order to judge under which conditions (certain forms of) AI paternalism might be considered acceptable, if at all. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Cory COVID-Bot is an artificial intelligence chatbot designed and built by a multisector collaboration to help people safely step towards COVID normal. Achieving COVID normal and avoiding unnecessary adverse health outcomes requires effective communication to the public regarding COVID safe behaviors, but reaching young, culturally and linguistically diverse members of the community is challenging for government. Cory COVID-Bot was developed to directly engage with difficult to reach populations in English and Vietnamese. In order to resolve public ambiguity and uncertainty about public health guidelines, and to stimulate safe behavior, Cory COVID-Bot provides updated recommendations and behavior change interventions, which emphasize the importance of COVID safe behaviors.  © 2022 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on the analysis of Eliezer Yudkowsky’s concept of “coherent extrapolated volition” (CEV) as a response to the need for a post-conventional, persuasive morality that meets the criteria of active trust in the sense of Anthony Giddens, which could be used in the case of autonomous machines. Based on the analysis of the results of the Moral Machine project, we formulate some guidelines for transformation of the idea of a coherent extrapolated volition into the concept of a coherent, extrapolated and clustered volition. The argumentation used in the paper is intended to show that the idea of CEV transformed into its clustered version can be used to build a technically and socially efficient decision-making pattern database for autonomous machines. © 2022 Copernicus Center Press.

AB  - The main challenges to increasing sales, usually lie with persuasion techniques and recommender systems. Persuasion Systems models (PSDs) analyse persuasion context, identifies the key issues and subsequently, enables mapping of persuasion techniques to functional requirements. This paper investigates persuasive factors for tourism booking websites, with the aim of utilizing derived significant factors at different stages, as the bases for weighted criteria analyses, and matrix factorization, integral in fuzzy logic computations. Two parallel case studies are carried out. The first tourism booking website is designed, based on Cialdini's persuasion techniques for the Malaysian hotel/tourism context, and tested with customers and travel agencies. The second study investigates social CRM and associations between gender, age and income on a group of different sample respondents. User evaluation indicates different weighted factors at the search, review and booking stages, as well as different perceptions, with regards to cross-selling. Comparative findings with successful cross-selling companies, such as Lazada and Shoppee further highlight three core influencing factors. These have enabled us to add specificity to some constructs in Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa's PSD dialogue support model, for the sampled Malaysian contexts. This triangulated approach can enable more holistic derivation of requirements and prediction and derivation of initial rules for future decision support systems.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Background: A multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis urges decision-making on immunotherapies, while persons with MS (PwMS) need to develop a coping concept in parallel. At this stage, PwMS ask how they themselves may contribute to controlling the disease. Evidence suggests that maintaining a healthy lifestyle (e.g. physical activity and stress management) is a key factor for healthy aging and preserving activity, while data on MS are complex. Objectives: Following the Medical Research Council framework, this study aimed to develop and investigate the feasibility of a new digital health application that conveys evidence-based patient information about lifestyle factors in MS and engages PwMS in relevant behaviour change techniques. Methods: Based on a digital health application promoting lifestyle management in breast cancer survivors, an MS-specific adaptation (‘levidex’) was developed. Feasibility was tested with 15 PwMS and eight MS experts. Subsequently, a six-week pilot study with eight PwMS was conducted. All participants provided feedback on practicability and acceptability via a questionnaire and took part in a semi-structured telephone interview. Levidex was revised after each test phase. Results: The final levidex tool includes 16 modules, 177 references and several other functions. Feasibility results showed that PwMS and MS experts perceived levidex as understandable (14 out of 15; 6 out of 8), trustworthy (15 out of 15; 8 out of 8), and relevant (10 out of 15; 8 out of 8). Interviews revealed potential for improvement regarding the length and complexity of some content. Piloting of the revised version confirmed good feasibility and high acceptance. Most participants felt inspired to initiate (7 out of 8) or had already implemented (5 out of 8) lifestyle changes after working with levidex. Conclusion: Results suggest that levidex is feasible and well-accepted by PwMS and MS experts. It might be a useful tool to support PwMS in adapting to their diagnosis and initiating health-promoting lifestyle changes. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Background: Diabetes and its complications account for 10% of annual health care spending in the United Kingdom. Digital health care interventions (DHIs) can provide scalable care, fostering diabetes self-management and reducing the risk of complications. Tailorability (providing personalized interventions) and usability are key to DHI engagement/effectiveness. User-centered design of DHIs (aligning features to end users’ needs) can generate more usable interventions, avoiding unintended consequences and improving user engagement. Objective: MyDiabetesIQ (MDIQ) is an artificial intelligence engine intended to predict users’ diabetes complications risk. It will underpin a user interface in which users will alter lifestyle parameters to see the impact on their future risks. MDIQ will link to an existing DHI, My Diabetes My Way (MDMW). We describe the user-centered design of the user interface of MDIQ as informed by human factors engineering. Methods: Current users of MDMW were invited to take part in focus groups to gather their insights about users being shown their likelihood of developing diabetes-related complications and any risks they perceived from using MDIQ. Findings from focus groups informed the development of a prototype MDIQ interface, which was then user-tested through the “think aloud” method, in which users speak aloud about their thoughts/impressions while performing prescribed tasks. Focus group and think aloud transcripts were analyzed thematically, using a combination of inductive and deductive analysis. For think aloud data, a sociotechnical model was used as a framework for thematic analysis. Results: Focus group participants (n=8) felt that some users could become anxious when shown their future complications risks. They highlighted the importance of easy navigation, jargon avoidance, and the use of positive/encouraging language. User testing of the prototype site through think aloud sessions (n=7) highlighted several usability issues. Issues included confusing visual cues and confusion over whether user-updated information fed back to health care teams. Some issues could be compounded for users with limited digital skills. Results from the focus groups and think aloud workshops were used in the development of a live MDIQ platform. Conclusions: Acting on the input of end users at each iterative stage of a digital tool’s development can help to prioritize users throughout the design process, ensuring the alignment of DHI features with user needs. The use of the sociotechnical framework encouraged the consideration of interactions between different sociotechnical dimensions in finding solutions to issues, for example, avoiding the exclusion of users with limited digital skills. Based on user feedback, the tool could scaffold good goal setting, allowing users to balance their palatable future complications risk against acceptable lifestyle changes. Optimal control of diabetes relies heavily on self-management. Tools such as MDMW/ MDIQ can offer personalized support for self-management alongside access to users’ electronic health records, potentially helping to delay or reduce long-term complications, thereby providing significant reductions in health care costs. © Cathy Shields, Scott G Cunningham, Deborah J Wake, Evridiki Fioratou, Doogie Brodie, Sam Philip, Nicholas T Conway.

AB  - The digitization of thought theory is not yet sufficient to meet the needs of the students. It is very necessary to strengthen the construction of ideological and political (IP) courses, strengthen the education of mainstream ideology, and occupy the initiative of discourse. There are effective ways and means to study the deep integration of information technologies into the new age of philosophy and philosophy education of students, which can greatly improve the quality of teaching and the effectiveness of humanities courses. The intuitive development of intellectual and political education through artificial intelligence is both a real prerequisite for modern development and technological innovation and for new ideas confronting the specific problems of thought-politics education, and it is a necessary prerequisite to ensure the quality and efficiency to improve the teaching of thought politics. AI in ways that embed technology provides a powerful impetus for contradictory movements in thought-politics discourse that lead the effective coordination of its internal elements to high-quality developments. In a practical way, we should take full advantage of the technical advantages of artificial intelligence, through intelligent mehrfachanalyse corresponding algorithms, artificial intelligenzbilder, and artificial roboterbilder photos and profiles that are used to write and accurately provide more precise, leading, stacking, and accurate estimates to maximize and to improve the accuracy of thought and policy education. Philosophy and political theory are the keys to guiding people to accomplish basic human tasks. With the passage of time and with continuous innovation, ideology and philosophical principles are both prerequisites for the self-development of the emotions of the age and necessary for improving the outcomes and effectiveness of scientific education. Advances in the field of artificial intelligence have fundamentally changed human life and have also impacted traditional school and university education systems. This brings new opportunities and challenges to students. This includes the use of smart technology to improve the learning process. Ideological teachers and policymakers must keep up with the all-round trend of the times, make full use of the benefits brought by intelligent new technologies and platforms, effectively improve the effect of ideological education, and further increase the attractiveness, attraction, persuasion, and contagion of ideological education. © 2022 Yang Zhou.

AB  - Digital personal assistants (DPAs) have recently grown in popularity because they are both a commercially available new technology and reasonably affordable to the average household. This opens opportunities for new ways to assist people in everyday activities in their homes through voice-interaction. Physical activity has significant health benefits, and yet globally, 1 in 4 adults are not active enough. To address this, we investigate the persuasive potential of DPAs in increasing people’s physical activity at home. We conducted a study with 48 participants to understand the effect of applying three of Fogg’s persuasive principles to the design of a DPA exercise programme: Suggestion, Virtual Reward, and Praise. Our findings show that DPAs have the potential, within their current technical and reactive capabilities, to persuade people to increase their physical activity at home, using Suggestion to encourage physical effort, Virtual Reward to encourage endurance, and Praise to create reassurance for beginners. Based on this, we offer three alternate perspectives for developing persuasive DPAs. We also discuss limitations of the study and suggest future research directions around using persuasion with DPAs. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With the advent of the information age, Internet technology and computer technology are gradually applied in various fields. Human daily life is inseparable from the help of information technology. The progress and development of the times are also changing our industrial environment. The Internet of things, artificial intelligence, and digital production have been widely used in the industrial field. We need to integrate the new intelligent management concept in the industrial 4.0 era into the modern industrial system and media communication. In the communication of sports culture, how to integrate the intelligent technology under the background of industry 4.0 and realize the spatiotemporal modeling and analysis of human behavior and behavior characteristics is the main content of our research. Firstly, this study briefly analyzes the development and historical process of industry 4.0 era and explores the impact of Internet of things and information technology on sports culture communication. This study analyzes the development process of Chinese sports culture communication and probes into the influence and significance of sports culture communication on human behavior. Under the background of industrial 4.0 management, a model of human temporal and spatial behavior change in sports culture communication is established. Human behavior trajectory is analyzed by data mining, human behavior recognition algorithm, behavior quantitative analysis method, and behavior feature model. The results show that under the background of industry 4.0 management, human behavior modeling can clearly describe the basic characteristics and behavior state in the process of sports culture communication and can predict and analyze the human behavior performance of such social activities and phenomena. Through data mining, data preprocessing, and behavior quantitative analysis, human behavior trajectory is studied. It has a positive impact on the behavior trend in human daily life. The main factor affecting behavior change is whether to receive sports culture news. © 2022 Zhihui Li.

AB  - Time management and goal setting skills are essential for student academic success in higher education. Meanwhile, the recent advances of chatbots offer new opportunities to support goal setting in a conversational way. In this preliminary research, we investigate the effects of chatbots as a conversational goal setting tool for student learning. We developed a chatbot called Sammy that invites students to pledge their study goals and reflect on their goal completion. We conducted a 7-day study among 70 undergraduate students. Analysis on pre- and post-study surveys indicated a significant improvement in student perceived time management in learning goals. Analysis on student daily check-in with Sammy showed an upward trend of student satisfaction in goal completion and confidence in future goal setting. In the future, we will conduct a more comprehensive mixed-method analysis, improve the functionalities and usability of Sammy, and conduct longitudinal studies. © 2022 28th Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2022.

AB  - To promote the face-to-face communication reduced by COVID-19, we proposed and implemented a context-aware Slack chatbot based on Cyber-Physical sensing that helps colleagues meet more often in the same place. Our system periodically collects the user’s internal context through Slack (cyber sensing) and uses small BLE beacons distributed to colleagues and beacon scanners installed in a laboratory to sense physical attendance (physical sensing). In addition, the system notifies the user of recommended actions, such as lunch or coffee break, depending on the context determined by the Cyber-Physical sensors. We deployed the proposed system in a laboratory environment and conducted an initial experiment for six weeks. Experimental results confirmed that our system can encourage serendipitous face-to-face communication during periods when the frequency of attending school and going to work dropped due to COVID-19. It was also found that in an environment such as a laboratory, where a certain level of trust has already been established, the openness of the collected information can further motivate users to participate in the system. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The best predictor of future injury is previous injury and this has not changed in a quarter century despite the introduction of evidence-based medicine and associated revisions to post-injury treatment and care. Nearly nine million sports-related injuries occur annually, and the majority of these require medical intervention prior to clearance for the athlete to return to play (RTP). Regardless of formal care, these athletes remain two to four times more likely to suffer a second injury for several years after RTP. In the case of children and young adults, this sets them up for a lifetime of negative health outcomes. Thus, the initial injury is the tipping point for a post-injury cascade of negative sequelae exposing athletes to more physical and psychological pain, higher medical costs, and greater risk of severe long-term negative health throughout their life. This chapter details the technologies and method that make up the automated Intelligent Phenotypic Plasticity Platform (IP3)—a revolutionary new approach to the current standard of post-injury care that identifies and targets deficits that underly second injury risk in sport. IP3 capitalizes on the biological concept of phenotypic plasticity (PP) to quantify an athlete’s functional adaptability across different performance environments, and it is implemented in two distinct steps: (1) phenomic profiling and (2) precision treatment. Phenomic profiling indexes the fitness and subsequent phenotypic plasticity of an individual athlete, which drives the personalization of the precision treatment step. IP3 leverages mixed-reality technologies to present true-to-life environments that test the athlete’s ability to adapt to dynamic stressors. The athlete’s phenotypic plasticity profile is then used to drive a precision treatment that systematically stresses the athlete, via a combination of behavioral-based and genetic fuzzy system models, to optimally enhance the athlete’s functional adaptability. IP3 is computationally light-weight and, through the integration with mixed-reality technologies, promotes real-time prediction, responsiveness, and adaptation. It is also the first ever phenotypic plasticity-based precision medicine platform, and the first precision sports medicine platform of any kind. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Cyanobacteria are ancient prokaryotes responsible for bloom formation in many freshwater resources worldwide. These dense agglomerations are a result of the rise of nutrient input (N and P) or temperature. The toxin content and illness associated with contact impair human health with repercussions in water quality. Produced by a wide variety of cyanobacteria species, CyanoBlooms are in need of a literature review to achieve a global scenario of its current impacts on freshwater resources aiming at changing behaviors towards CyanoBlooms globally and by making communities more resilient to this recurrent problem. With a global distribution, recent data highlight the impacts of climate change on CyanoBlooms occurrence, namely through the rise of temperature and nutrient input from storms and heavy rainfall. With current worldwide regulations based on the enumeration of the nutrient input of freshwater ecosystems, the increase in field monitoring regarding CyanoBlooms occurrence is demanded since evaluation of this parameter may conceal these massive agglomerations resulting in human health episodes and cyanotoxin outbreaks. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Smartphone overuse can lead to a series of physical, mental and social disturbances. This problem is more prevalent among young adults as compared to other demographic groups. Additionally, university students are already undergoing high cognitive loads and stress conditions; therefore, they are more susceptible to smartphone addiction and its derived problems. In this paper, we present a novel approach where a conversational mobile agent uses persuasive messages exploring the reflective mind to raise users’ awareness of their usage and consequently induce reduction behaviors. We conducted a four-week study with 16 university students undergoing stressful conditions—a global lockdown during their semester—and evaluated the impact of the agent on smartphone usage reduction and the perceived usefulness of such an approach. Results show the efficacy of self-tracking in the behavior change process: 81% of the users reduced their usage time, and all of them mentioned that having a conversational agent alerting them about their usage was useful. Before this experiment, only 68% of them considered such an approach could be useful. In conclusion, users deemed it essential to have an engaging conversational agent on their smartphones, in terms of helping them become more aware of usage times. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: The National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) reduces diabetes incidence and associated medical costs but is typically staffing-intensive, limiting scalability. We evaluated an alternative delivery method with 3933 members of a program powered by conversational Artificial Intelligence (AI) called Lark DPP that has full recognition from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Methods: We compared weight loss maintenance at 12 months between two groups: 1) CDC qualifiers who completed ≥4 educational lessons over 9 months (n = 191) and 2) non-qualifiers who did not complete the required CDC lessons but provided weigh-ins at 12 months (n = 223). For a secondary aim, we removed the requirement for a 12-month weight and used logistic regression to investigate predictors of weight nadir in 3148 members. Results: CDC qualifiers maintained greater weight loss at 12 months than non-qualifiers (M = 5.3%, SE =.8 vs. M = 3.3%, SE =.8; p =.015), with 40% achieving ≥5%. The weight nadir of 3148 members was 4.2% (SE =.1), with 35% achieving ≥5%. Male sex (β =.11; P =.009), weeks with ≥2 weigh-ins (β =.68; P <.0001), and days with an AI-powered coaching exchange (β =.43; P <.0001) were associated with a greater likelihood of achieving ≥5% weight loss. Conclusions: An AI-powered DPP facilitated weight loss and maintenance commensurate with outcomes of other digital and in-person programs not powered by AI. Beyond CDC lesson completion, engaging with AI coaching and frequent weighing increased the likelihood of achieving ≥5% weight loss. An AI-powered program is an effective method to deliver the DPP in a scalable, resource-efficient manner to keep pace with the prediabetes epidemic. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Continuously growing medical knowledge and the increasing amount of data make it difficult for medical professionals to keep track of all new information and to place it in the context of existing information. A variety of digital technologies and artificial intelligence-based methods are currently available as persuasive tools to empower physicians in clinical decision-making and improve health care quality. A novel diagnostic decision support system (DDSS) prototype developed by Ada Health GmbH with a focus on traceability, transparency, and usability will be examined more closely in this study. Objective: The aim of this study is to test the feasibility and functionality of a novel DDSS prototype, exploring its potential and performance in identifying the underlying cause of acute dyspnea in patients at the University Hospital Basel. Methods: A prospective, observational feasibility study was conducted at the emergency department (ED) and internal medicine ward of the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. A convenience sample of 20 adult patients admitted to the ED with dyspnea as the chief complaint and a high probability of inpatient admission was selected. A study physician followed the patients admitted to the ED throughout the hospitalization without interfering with the routine clinical work. Routinely collected health-related personal data from these patients were entered into the DDSS prototype. The DDSS prototype's resulting disease probability list was compared with the gold-standard main diagnosis provided by the treating physician. Results: The DDSS presented information with high clarity and had a user-friendly, novel, and transparent interface. The DDSS prototype was not perfectly suited for the ED as case entry was time-consuming (1.5-2 hours per case). It provided accurate decision support in the clinical inpatient setting (average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was the first diagnosis listed: 6/20, 30%, SD 2.10%; average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was listed as one of the top 3: 11/20, 55%, SD 2.39%; average of cases in which the correct diagnosis was listed as one of the top 5: 14/20, 70%, SD 2.26%) in patients with dyspnea as the main presenting complaint. Conclusions: The study of the feasibility and functionality of the tool was successful, with some limitations. Used in the right place, the DDSS has the potential to support physicians in their decision-making process by showing new pathways and unintentionally ignored diagnoses. The DDSS prototype had some limitations regarding the process of data input, diagnostic accuracy, and completeness of the integrated medical knowledge. The results of this study provide a basis for the tool's further development. In addition, future studies should be conducted with the aim to overcome the current limitations of the tool and study design. © 2022 JMIR Publications Inc.. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Health behaviour change is a difficult and prolonged process that requires sustained motivation and determination. Conversational agents have shown promise in supporting the change process in the past. One therapy approach that facilitates change and has been used as a framework for conversational agents is motivational interviewing. However, existing implementations of this therapy approach lack the deep understanding of user utterances that is essential to the spirit of motivational interviewing. To address this lack of understanding, we introduce the GLoHBCD, a German dataset of naturalistic language around health behaviour change. Data was sourced from a popular German weight loss forum and annotated using theoretically grounded motivational interviewing categories. We describe the process of dataset construction and present evaluation results. Initial experiments suggest a potential for broad applicability of the data and the resulting classifiers across different behaviour change domains. We make code to replicate the dataset and experiments available on Github. © European Language Resources Association (ELRA), licensed under CC-BY-NC-4.0.

AB  - Computer-generated imagery (CGI) influencers are at the forefront of brand communication trends driven by artificial intelligence (AI). Focusing on Lil Miquela, this study explores the mechanism underlying the CGI influencer’s persuasiveness based on the computers-are-social-actors (CASA) framework. The study examines how consumers’ attitudes toward the influencer’s sponsored posts and the endorsed brands are impacted by her perceived anthropomorphism through mediators of social presence and perceived attractiveness. Based on a survey of generation Z consumers, we found that the CGI influencer’s perceived anthropomorphism effectively enhances her social presence, which in turn boosts her perceived physical and social attractiveness, respectively, to drive consumer evaluation outcomes. © 2022 American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - Unhealthy eating behavior is a major public health issue with serious repercussions on an individual’s health. One potential solution to overcome this problem, and help people change their eating behavior, is to develop conversational systems able to recommend healthy recipes. One challenge for such systems is to deliver personalized recommendations matching users’ needs and preferences. Beyond the intrinsic quality of the recommendation itself, various factors might also influence users’ perception of a recommendation. In this paper, we present Cora, a conversational system that recommends recipes aligned with its users’ eating habits and current preferences. Users can interact with Cora in two different ways. They can select pre-defined answers by clicking on buttons to talk to Cora or write text in natural language. Additionally, Cora can engage users through a social dialogue, or go straight to the point. Cora is also able to propose different alternatives and to justify its recipes recommendation by explaining the trade-off between them. We conduct two experiments. In the first one, we evaluate the impact of Cora’s conversational skills and users’ interaction mode on users’ perception and intention to cook the recommended recipes. Our results show that a conversational recommendation system that engages its users through a rapport-building dialogue improves users’ perception of the interaction as well as their perception of the system. In the second evaluation, we evaluate the influence of Cora’s explanations and recommendation comparisons on users’ perception. Our results show that explanations positively influence users’ perception of a recommender system. However, comparing healthy recipes with a decoy is a double-edged sword. Although such comparison is perceived as significantly more useful compared to one single healthy recommendation, explaining the difference between the decoy and the healthy recipe would actually make people less likely to use the system.

AB  - Artificial intelligence and machine learning have the power to revolutionize the healthcare industry and unlock a world of amazing potential. But unless all interested parties possess rudimentary knowledge of healthcare and machine learning fundamentals and principles, it is not able to fully utilize the capabilities of these technologies. This present literature survey work analyzes the research which implemented the machine learning algorithms in the detection of pneumonia. Furthermore, it is increasingly obvious that AI systems will not substantially replace human clinicians in patient care but rather support them. Human physicians may eventually gravitate toward duties and work arrangements that make use of particularly human abilities like empathy, persuasion, and big-picture integration. Those healthcare professionals who refuse to collaborate with artificial intelligence may end up being the only ones to lose their professions in the future.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - A starting point of many digital health interventions informed by the Stages of Change Model of behavior change is assessing a person's readiness to change. In this paper, we use the concept of readiness to develop and validate a prediction model of health-seeking behavior in the context of family planning. We conducted a secondary analysis of routinely collected, anonymized health data submitted by 4,088 female users of a free health chatbot in Kenya. We developed a prediction model of (future) self-reported action by randomly splitting the data into training and test data sets (80/20, stratified by the outcome). We further split the training data into 10 folds for cross-validating the hyperparameter tuning step in model selection. We fit nine different classification models and selected the model that maximized the area under the receiver operator curve. We then fit the selected model to the full training dataset and evaluated the performance of this model on the holdout test data. The model predicted who will visit a family planning provider in the future with high precision (0.93) and moderate recall (0.75). Using the Stages of Change framework, we concluded that 29% of women were in the "Preparation"stage, 21% were in the "Contemplation"stage, and 50% were in the "Pre-Contemplation"stage. We demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict future healthcare-seeking behavior based on information learned during the initial encounter. Models like this may help intervention developers to tailor strategies and content in real-time.  © 2021 Society of Behavioral Medicine 2021. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the e-commerce context, are we persuaded more by a product recommendation that matches our preferences (content filtering) or by one that is endorsed by others like us (collaborative filtering)? We addressed this question by conceptualizing these two filtering types as cues that trigger cognitive heuristics (mental shortcuts), following the heuristic-systematic model in social psychology. In addition, we investigated whether the degree to which the recommendation matches user preferences (or other users’ endorsements) provides an argument for systematic processing, especially for those who need deeper insights into the accuracy of the algorithm, particularly in product categories where quality is subjective. Data from a 2 (algorithm type: content vs. collaborative filtering) x 3 (percentage match: low vs. medium vs. high) x 2 (product category: search vs. experience) + 2 (control: search and experience) between-subjects experiment (N = 469) reveal that for experience products, consumers prefer content-based filtering with higher percentage matches, because it is perceived as offering more transparency. This is especially true for individuals with high need for cognition. For search products, however, collaborative filtering leads to more positive evaluations by triggering the “bandwagon effect.” These findings have implications for theory pertaining to the use of artificial intelligence in strategic communications and design of algorithms for e-commerce recommender systems. © Copyright © 2021, American Academy of Advertising.

AB  - Background: Medication adherence is generally low and challenging to address because patient actions control healthcare delivery outside of medical environments. Behavioral nudging changes clinician behavior, but nudging patient decision-making requires further testing. This trial evaluated whether behavioral nudges can increase statin adherence, measured as the proportion of days covered (PDC). Methods: In a 12-month parallel-group, unblinded, randomized controlled trial, adult patients in Intermountain Healthcare cardiology clinics were enrolled. Inclusion required an indication for statins and membership in SelectHealth insurance. Subjects were randomized 1:1 to control or nudges. Nudge content, timing, frequency, and delivery route were personalized by CareCentra using machine learning of subject motivations and abilities from psychographic assessment, demographics, social determinants, and the Intermountain Mortality Risk Score. PDC calculation used SelectHealth claims data. Results: Among 182 subjects, age averaged 63.2±8.5 years, 25.8% were female, baseline LDL-C was 82.5±32.7 mg/dL, and 93.4% had coronary disease. Characteristics were balanced between nudge (n = 89) and control arms (n = 93). The statin PDC was greater at 12 months in the nudge group (PDC: 0.742±0.318) compared to controls (PDC: 0.639±0.358, P = 0.042). Adherent subjects (PDC ≥80%) were more concentrated in the nudge group (66.3% vs controls: 50.5%, P = 0.036) while a composite of death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and revascularization was non-significant (nudges: 6.7% vs control: 10.8%, P = 0.44). Conclusions: Persuasive behavioral nudges driven by artificial intelligence resulted in a clinically important increase in statin adherence in general cardiology patients. This precision patient decision support utilized computerized nudge design and delivery with minimal on-going human input. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The European Union Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act proposes to ban AI systems that ”manipulate persons through subliminal techniques or exploit the fragility of vulnerable individuals, and could potentially harm the manipulated individual or third person”. This article takes the perspective of cognitive psychology to analyze and understand what algorithmic manipulation consists of, who vulnerable individuals may be, and what is considered as harm. Subliminal techniques are expanded with concepts from behavioral science and the study of preference change. Individual psychometric differences which can be exploited are used to expand the concept of vulnerable individuals. The concept of harm is explored beyond physical and psychological harm to consider harm to one’s time and right to an un-manipulated opinion. The paper offers policy recommendations that extend from the paper’s analyses. © 2022 by the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adopting contextually appropriate, audience-tailored linguistic styles is critical to the success of user-centric language generation systems (e.g., chatbots, computer-aided writing, dialog systems). While existing approaches demonstrate textual style transfer with large volumes of parallel or non-parallel data, we argue that grounding style on audience-independent external factors is innately limiting for two reasons. First, it is difficult to collect large volumes of audience-specific stylistic data. Second, some stylistic objectives (e.g., persuasiveness, memorability, empathy) are hard to define without audience feedback. In this paper, we propose the novel task of style infusion - infusing the stylistic preferences of audiences in pretrained language generation models. Since humans are better at pairwise comparisons than direct scoring - i.e., is Sample-A more persuasive/polite/empathic than Sample-B - we leverage limited pairwise human judgments to bootstrap a style analysis model and augment our seed set of judgments. We then infuse the learned textual style in a GPT-2 based text generator while balancing fluency and style adoption. With quantitative and qualitative assessments, we show that our infusion approach can generate compelling stylized examples with generic text prompts.

AB  - The single biggest factor driving health outcomes is patient behavior. The CHR Model (County Health Rankings Model) weights socioeconomic factors, lifestyle behaviors, and physical environment factors collectively at 80% in driving impact on health outcomes, to the 20% weight for access to and quality of clinical care. Commercial determinants of health affect everyone today and unhealthy choices worsen pre-existing economic, social, and racial inequities. Yet there is a disproportionate focus on therapeutic intervention to the exclusion of shaping patient behaviors to improve healthcare. If the recent pandemic taught us a critically important lesson, it is the imperative to look beyond clinical care. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), long-standing systemic health and social inequities put various groups of people at higher risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, including many racial and ethnic minority groups. The virus was simply more efficient in detecting such vulnerabilities than the guardians of these physiologies. These insights from the pandemic come at the heel of a confluence of three major accelerants that may radically reshape our approaches to hot-spotting vulnerabilities and managing them before they manifest in a derangement or disease. They are the recent strides in behavioral economics and behavior science; advances in remote monitoring and personal health technologies; and developments in artificial intelligence and data sciences. These accelerants allow us to imagine a previously impossible vision—we can now build and maintain a unified health algorithm for every individual that can dynamically track the two interdependent streams of risk, clinical and behavioral. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Interactive persuasive techniques, supported by the ability to retrieve real-time behaviour and other contextual data, offer an unprecedented opportunity to manage online activity. An example is Responsible Gambling (RG) tools. Currently, despite vast potential, they do not make use of real time gambling behaviour data, whether captured by operators (device, location, bets, limits set) or self-reported (finance, emotion, online browsing history). To design useful interactive persuasive tools, it is important to understand users’ perceptions to ensure maximum acceptance. Aims: Explore gamblers’ perceptions of the potential of future online platforms in providing data-driven, real-time, persuasive interventions for supporting responsible online gambling. Method: Qualitative semi-structured interviews conducted with 22 gamblers (80% men; 15 ex-problem, 7 current), regarding perceptions of the potential of persuasive techniques. Results: Thematic analysis showed participants were positive about data-driven, real-time, interactive technology for (i) providing information (educational, personal and comparative), (ii) limiting gambling (time and money spent, access to gambling operators) and (iii) providing support to gamblers (advice, feedback and context sensing). The technology was identified as most appropriate for low to moderate gamblers. Conclusions: Participants were positive about the new data access, techniques and modalities of interactions for supporting responsible online gambling. To ensure maximum reach and acceptability, such technology should be customised to fit individual profiles. Personalisation and tailoring of content, interactivity, framing and timing are necessary to enhance acceptance of such technology and avoid reactance, unintended harm, inconvenience, and information overload. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The usage of Artificial intelligence in; medical arena has proved to be a game changer in the detection and diagnosis of several medical conditions. In the current digital era, children with stressful medical issues are suffering from Deep Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (DOCD). This kind of mental stress occurs in children because of the continuous usage of gadgets such as mobile phone, playing games using play stations, watching videos on tablets, etc. In most of the possibilities, single children are the ones affected with several obsessions such as stubborn activities, fighting for selfish priorities and so on. In medical terms, these kinds of complex behavioral changes are identified as DOCD. Genetic behaviors sometimes in a few group of children are also noticed as a modality difference. As symptoms are psychiatric impairment, such a child remains isolated, abnormal silence, being obsessive and repeating irrelevant words, high stress or anxiety. All medical challenges could be treated as healthcare research metrics and the gradual increase in DOCD disorder among children of this generation can be considered too. Early detection of DOCD is essential as it can help in early diagnosis but techniques to do so is unavailable currently. Deep learning-an artificial intelligence method can be utilized to detect DOCD, diagnose and treat it and bring about a positive character in children. Behavior changes in children can be classified and detected using transfer learning algorithms. In COVID-19 pandemic situation, 3% of DOCD has increased to 10-15% as a disorder. This information is retrieved from children by monitoring negative activities, unusual behavior such as nail biting, removing spectacles and placing them in the wrong place, watching tablets, mobile phones and television for more hours. Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), input such as MRI (Magnetic resonance Imaging) is used for experimenting the variations in behavior with the high dimension that are analyzed from the image dataset. Using Transfer Learning with Inception V3-, CNN generalization of misophonia level can be statistically analyzed to avoid overfitting problems. By employing AI techniques, the aggression level can be predicted using data augmentation method with better accuracy and a low error rate than the existing systems. In the research it is observed that using the model employing Inception-V3 transfer learning CNN a better prediction of aggression levels can be achieved in comparison to the existing CNN model used. © 2022 North Atlantic University Union NAUN.

AB  - The electrocardiogram is one of the most used medical tests worldwide. Despite its prevalent use in the healthcare sector, there exists a limited understanding in how medical practitioners interpret it. This is mainly due to the scarcity of international guidelines that unify its interpretation across different health institutions. This leads to a lack of training and unpreparedness by medical students who are about to join the medical workforce. In this paper, we propose a blueprint for a proactive artificial intelligence and augmented reality-based eye tracking system to train cardiology professionals for a better electrocardiogram interpretation. The proposed blueprint is inspired from extensive interviews with cardiology medical practitioners as well as students who interpret electrocardiograms as part of their daily practice. The interviews contributed to identifying the major pain-points within the process of electrocardiogram interpretation. The interviews were also critical in conceptualizing the persuasive components of the training system for a guided correct electrocardiogram interpretation. Throughout the presented blueprint, we detail the three components that constitute the system. These are the augmented reality-based interactive training interface, the artificial intelligence-based processing sub-system, and finally the adaptive electrocardiogram dataset. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study employed a survey to examine the role of social status on the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology. One’s self-efficacy with using AI technology was assumed to be determined by various factors coming from demographic status, which ultimately leads to the intention to use that technology. This was hypothesized based on the technology acceptance model, self-efficacy, and diffusion of innovation. Participants (n = 369) reported their perceived mastery of AI products, vicarious experiences with AI products, social persuasions of using AI products, AI self-efficacy, perceived usefulness of AI, perceived ease of using AI, intention to use AI, and demographic information. Both education level and income were found to affect the intention to adopt AI technology through AI self-efficacy. However, the age of participants was found not to be a determinant.

AB  - How can the public sector use AI ethically and responsibly for the benefit of people? The sustainable development and deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in the public sector requires dialogue and deliberation between developers, decision makers, deployers, end users, and the public. This paper contributes to the debate on how to develop persuasive government approaches for steering the development and use of AI. We examine the ethical issues and the role of the public in the debate on developing public sector governance of socially and democratically sustainable and technology-intensive societies. To concretize this discussion, we study the co-development of a Finnish national AI program AuroraAI, which aims to provide citizens with tailored and timely services for different life situations, utilizing AI. With the help of this case study, we investigate the challenges posed by the development and use of AI in the service of public administration. We draw particular attention to the efforts made by the AuroraAI Ethics Board in deliberating the AuroraAI solution options and working toward a sustainable and inclusive AI society.

AB  - Motivational interviewing (MI) improves readiness for smoking cessation but can be time-intensive, require substantial expertise, and patients must still be linked with evidence-based cessation programs sensitive to local resources and patient preferences. Technology-assisted MI may provide a more efficient way to promote readiness and facilitate behavior change. This study developed the Technology Assisted Motivational Interviewing Coach (TAMI), a digital conversational agent that incorporates machine learning models to deliver MI for tobacco cessation and create tailored quit plans. This manuscript describes and evaluates the architecture and nested machine learning models within TAMI leveraged during the pilot clinical trial.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The technological leaps of artificial intelligence (AI) and the rise of machine learning have triggered significant progress in a plethora of natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding tasks. One of these tasks is argumentation mining which has received significant interest in recent years and is regarded as a key domain for future decision-making systems, behaviour modelling, and natural language understanding problems. Until recently, natural language modelling tasks, such as computational argumentation schemes, were often tested in controlled environments, such as persuasive essays, reducing unexpected behaviours that could occur in real-life settings, like a public debate on social media. Additionally, the growing demand for enhancing the trust and the explainability of the AI services has dictated the design and adoption of modelling schemes to increase the confidence in the outcomes of the AI solutions. This paper attempts to explore modelling argumentation in short text and proposes a novel framework for argumentation detection under the name Abstract Framework for Argumentation Detection (AFAD). Moreover, different proof-of-concept implementations are provided to examine the applicability of the proposed framework to very short text developing a rule-based mechanism and compare the results with data-driven solutions. Eventually, a combination of the deployed methods is applied increasing the correct predictions in the minority class on an imbalanced dataset. The findings suggest that the modelling process provides solid grounds for technical research while the hybrid solutions have the potential to be applied to a wide range of NLP-related tasks offering a deeper understanding of human language and reasoning. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - While neural approaches to argument mining (AM) have advanced considerably, most of the recent work has been limited to parsing monologues. With an urgent interest in the use of conversational agents for broader societal applications, there is a need to advance the state-of-the-art in argument parsers for dialogues. This enables progress towards more purposeful conversations involving persuasion, debate and deliberation. This paper discusses Dialo-AP, an end-to-end argument parser that constructs argument graphs from dialogues. We formulate AM as dependency parsing of elementary and argumentative discourse units; the system is trained using extensive pre-training and curriculum learning comprising nine diverse corpora. Dialo-AP is capable of generating argument graphs from dialogues by performing all subtasks of AM. Compared to existing state-ofthe-art baselines, Dialo-AP achieves significant improvements across all tasks, which is further validated through rigorous human evaluation. © 2022 Proceedings - International Conference on Computational Linguistics, COLING.

AB  - Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease, with a global prevalence of approximately 24% in the general population. It is caused by fat accumulation in the liver secondary to insulin resistance, visceral obesity, and/or features of metabolic syndrome. A genetic susceptibility contributes to the phenotype, accounting for a more severe course of liver disease and the observed clinical variability. In fact, despite liver steatosis being considered a relatively benign entity, inflammation related to oxidative stress and lipid-derived damage may lead to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which constitutes the progressive disease. Accumulation of hepatic fibrosis can lead to cirrhosis and provide the environment for hepatocellular carcinoma. Obese and diabetic individuals represent a well-acknowledged high risk population. The assessment of liver fibrosis plays a crucial role in clinical setting, as liver-related mortality increases parallel to fibrosis stage. A liver biopsy is currently considered the reference standard for the diagnosis of NASH and the fibrosis stage, but many non-invasive tools are used with the aim of replacing histology for diagnosis and prognosis purposes. Blood based scores and liver stiffness are the most widely used and validated tools to assess liver fibrosis. Management of NAFLD resides on environmental interventions, including diet and physical activity to induce weight loss, and avoiding harmful nutrients, including fructose-sweetened beverages and high glycemic index foods, that are directly implied in liver injury. Multiple trials with investigational drugs are currently explored to treat fibrosing NASH, with promising results and it can be expected that a liver direct therapy aiming at steatohepatitis and fibrosis will become available soon. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Food waste occurs from harvesting to consumption. Applying procedures and technologies, changing attitudes, and promoting awareness have positive social, economic, and environmental impacts that can contribute to reducing food waste. The paper presents a decision support system (DSS) to predict the quality evolution of fruits and vegetables, particularly of peaches, and estimate its commercialization period at the highest overall perceived quality by consumers, thus contributing to reducing food waste. The Fuzzy Logic DSS predicts the evolution of the physical-chemical parameters of peaches (hardness, soluble solids content, and acidity) depending on the cultivar (Royal Summer and Royal Time), storage time, and temperature. As the range of the values of these physical-chemical parameters of peaches that consumers perceive to be at their highest quality are known, the DSS predicts the marketable period in days. Case studies were developed to analyze the influence of each physical-chemical parameter on the commercialization days (number and time to start). It is concluded that temperature is the most important parameter for fruit conservation. A low value of conservation temperature allows for the significant extension of the time that peaches can be sold at the highest quality. Hardness is used to determine the harvest date since it is an index of fruit ripeness. The same conclusion is obtained for the influence of the soluble solids content. The influence of acidity on marketable days is less than the other physical-chemical parameters. This DSS helps retailers to sell their peaches at the highest quality with benefits for all parties. It also helps in the decision-making concerning the actions to take when fruits are reaching the end of their highest quality by predicting the range of the commercialization days. This formulation can be extended to other fruits and vegetables and in the last instance contribute to the reduction of food loss and waste, consequently promoting social, economic, and environmental aspects of our daily life. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper studies the problem of information design in a general security game setting in which multiple independent self-interested defenders attempt to provide protection simultaneously on the same set of important targets against an unknown attacker. A principal, who can be one of the defenders, has access to certain private information (i.e., attacker type) whereas other defenders do not. We investigate the question of how that principal, with additional private information, can influence the decisions of the defenders by partially and strategically revealing her information. In particular, we develop a polynomial-time ellipsoid algorithm to compute an optimal private signaling scheme. Our key finding is that the separation oracle in the ellipsoid approach can be carefully reduced to bipartite matching. Furthermore, we introduce a compact representation of any ex-ante persuasive signaling schemes by exploiting intrinsic security resource allocation structures, enabling us to compute an optimal scheme significantly faster. Our experiment results show that by strategically revealing private information, the principal can significantly enhance the protection effectiveness on the targets. © 2022 Proceedings of the 38th Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence, UAI 2022.

AB  - Considering widespread resistance to COVID-19 preventive measures, the authors draw on hypocrisy induction theory to examine whether online chatbots can be used to induce hypocrisy and increase compliance with social distancing guidelines. The experiment demonstrates that when a chatbot induces hypocrisy by reminding participants that they have failed to comply with social distancing recommendations, they feel guilty about violating social norms. To reinstate confidence in their personal standards, they form favorable attitudes toward the chatbot ad and establish intentions to comply with recommendations. Interestingly, the persuasive power of hypocrisy induction differs depending on the level of anthropomorphism of the chatbot. When a humanlike chatbot reminds them of their hypocritical behavior, participants feel higher levels of guilt and act more desirably, but a machinelike chatbot is not effective for creating guilt or generating compliance.  © Copyright 2022, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2022.

AB  - Green and climate smart mining (GCSM) is a recent advancement in mining that not only alleviates the exacerbating environmental and climate-related impacts but also protects the well-being of the communities in the mining regions. However, there is still a long way to transform current mining practices into GCSM due to many challenges hampering its implementation process. This study applied a three-phase systematic research approach to develop a decision support system to recognize and eradicate these challenges through persuasive strategic pathways. In the first phase, a combination of extensive literature review and the fuzzy Delphi method identifies 9 pathways to overcome 24 challenges divided into five broad categories. The second phase involves an integrated fuzzy decision analysis approach to rank all the challenges, explore their interrelationships, and prioritize the pathways. Finally, the sensitivity analysis is conducted for pathways prioritization against each of the five categories of challenges. The proposed system is illustrated by conducting a case study of the Chinese mining industry to verify its utility and applicability. Analysis unveiled challenges related to government and regulatory and technical and operational categories as the most critical to hamper GCSM implementation, which can be overcome through three best pathways, including low-interest loans and subsidies, cognitive development, and strict codes for newer enterprises. This research is a novel contribution to building connections between mining and sustainability science that provides a comprehensive insight for mining affiliated professionals to implement and promote GCSM, which has not yet been presented in the existing literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Persuasive technologies have gained popularity around the world. This type of technology aims to change the behavior of people in different circumstances using the persuasion method. Within this classification of technologies we have virtual assistants whose function is to interact in a personalized way with the user. This research aims to provide a solution to the low levels of recycling habits in citizens, which is caused by inefficient programs and/or activities applied by authorities, educational centers and households of socioeconomic levels. low fees by promoting recycling issues. We proposed the use of a virtual assistant to increase knowledge and show the benefits of recycling, in order to generate an improvement in the behavior of the population. To validate this research, two knowledge tests on recycling issues were administered to 69 university students at the beginning and end of the process. After using our virtual assistant, the participants appeared and increased their knowledge by 70.49%.  © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Sender-receiver interactions, and specifically persuasion games, are widely researched in economic modeling and artificial intelligence, and serve as a solid foundation for powerful applications. However, in the classic persuasion games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the decision-maker are abstract or well-structured application-specific signals rather than natural (human) language messages, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion setups. This paper addresses the use of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact on the decisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the prediction of these decisions. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction experiment. At each trial of the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation in a hotel, by sending her a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several scored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert, and her payoff in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the review score distribution available to the expert only. The expert’s payoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker chooses the hotel. We also compare the behavioral patterns in this experiment to the equivalent patterns in similar experiments where the communication is based on the numerical values of the reviews rather than the reviews’ text, and observe substantial differences which can be explained through an equilibrium analysis of the game. We consider a number of modeling approaches for our verbal communication setup, differing from each other in the model type (deep neural network (DNN) vs. linear classifier), the type of features used by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the source of the textual features (DNN-based vs. hand-crafted). Our results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a sequential modeling approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied. Further analysis of the hand-crafted textual features allows us to make initial observations about the aspects of text that drive decision making in our setup. © 2022 AI Access Foundation.

AB  - The foundation to successful diabetes self-management includes making several healthy behavior decisions daily. The Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists 7 (ADCES7) Self-Care behaviors (Association of Diabetes Care and Education Specialists, 2021) highlights healthy coping, healthy eating, being active, monitoring, taking medication, problem solving, and reducing risks. In addition to the Self-Care behaviors, the ADCES7 framework is built upon integrating technologies such as medical devices, wearable technologies, digital health, and telehealth into diabetes care and education. Diabetes healthcare professionals support persons with diabetes (PWD) to make behavior changes with tools such as these technologies. Digital health and telehealth interventions can augment behaviors to support diabetes self-management. Within the healthcare ecosystem, there are four requirements needed to encompass healthy behavior change related to digital health and telehealth tools. First, PWD must be able to access the tool and be adequately trained on the tool. Second, PWD must be able to receive feedback on tool use and data generated by the tool. Third, PWD should receive coaching on behavior change. Fourth, PWD must receive support for ongoing use of the tool. The availability of these tools has rapidly increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. This chapter will review the current evidence, barriers, and future directions for digital health and telehealth interventions in the context of behavior change. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In ongoing and consecutive conversations with persons, a social robot has to determine which aspects to remember and how to address them in the conversation. In the health domain, important aspects concern the health-related goals, the experienced progress (expressed sentiment) and the ongoing motivation to pursue them. Despite the progress in speech technology and conversational agents, most social robots lack a memory for such experience sharing. This paper presents the design and evaluation of a conversational memory for personalized behavior change support conversations on healthy nutrition via memory-based motivational rephrasing. The main hypothesis is that referring to previous sessions improves motivation and goal attainment, particularly when references vary. In addition, the paper explores how far motivational rephrasing affects user's perception of the conversational agent (the virtual Furhat). An experiment with 79 participants was conducted via Zoom, consisting of three conversation sessions. The results showed a significant increase in participants' change in motivation when multiple references to previous sessions were provided. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Departing from previous work on the use of well-established behavior change techniques in an mHealth intervention based on a conversational agent (CA), we propose in this contribution a new architecture for the design of behavior change CAs. This novel approach combines the use of an advanced natural language platform (Dialogflow) with the explicit representation, in an ontology, of how behavior change techniques can be operationalized. The integration of these two components is explained, as well as the most challenging aspect of using the advanced features of the platform in a way that allowed the agent to lead the dialogue flow, when needed. A successful proof of concept was built, which can be the basis for the development of advanced conversational agents, combining natural language tools with ontology-based knowledge representation. © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - We study a Bayesian persuasion setting in which the receiver is trying to match the (binary) state of the world. The sender’s utility is partially aligned with the receiver’s, in that conditioned on the receiver’s action, the sender derives higher utility when the state of the world matches the action. Our focus is on whether in such a setting, being constrained helps a receiver. Intuitively, if the receiver can only take the sender’s preferred action with smaller probability, the sender might have to reveal more information, so that the receiver can take the action more specifically when the sender prefers it. We show that with a binary state of the world, this intuition indeed carries through: under very mild non-degeneracy conditions, a more constrained receiver will always obtain (weakly) higher utility than a less constrained one. Unfortunately, without additional assumptions, the result does not hold when there are more than two states in the world, which we show with an explicit example. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the further research of artificial intelligence technology, motion recognition technology is widely used in posture analysis of sports training. However, the interference of light, Angle, and distance in real life makes the existing model unable to focus on the expression of human movements. Aiming at the above problems, this paper proposes a motion training attitude analysis method based on a multiscale spatiotemporal graph convolution network. Firstly, the spatiotemporal image of the skeleton is constructed, and then the convolution operation is performed on the spatiotemporal image of the skeleton. Finally, the convolution results are linearly weighted and fused to capture the characteristics of action types with different time lengths. At the same time, the algorithm increases the processing of some important information loss and increases the randomness of the data set. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can adapt to the behavior changes of different complexity, and the model performance and recognition accuracy are significantly improved.  © 2022 Yuqin Sun and Youliang Li.

AB  - The COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic is causing health crises around the world. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), wearing a face mask is an effective means of protection in public places. In most public gatherings such as shopping centers, theaters, parks, it is increasingly necessary to make sure that people in the crowd are wearing masks. Developing an artificial intelligence solution that determines regardless of whether an individual is wearing a cover and letting it in will be great help for the society. In this case, a simple face mask detection system is built using deep learning techniques such as machine learning and persuasive neural network. The model is built with machine learning and OpenCV libraries often used for real-time applications. This model can also be used to develop complete software that scans each person before going to a public meeting © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Although persuasive gamified systems have been proven to be effective at motivating behaviour change in various domains of life, there are reoccurring research questions around the effectiveness of these systems for players with various user characteristics, cultures, and across various behaviour domains. Our paper explores the effectiveness of various persuasive strategies implemented in a persuasive game for disease awareness and prevention, specifically, persuasive games for creating awareness about COVID-19 among the African audience and the impact of user personality traits on the effectiveness of the strategies. An in-the-wild study among 51 Africans reveals that the 12 persuasive strategies implemented in the game were perceived as highly effective at motivating behaviour change overall. We also uncovered that people high in Agreeableness were motivated by eight of the strategies, while people high in Neuroticism were demotivated by the Self-Monitoring strategy. Agreeableness and Conscientiousness emerged as the personality traits that predicted most of the variability in the effectiveness of the persuasive strategies implemented in the game. Based on the findings and the qualitative comments, we provide design suggestions for implementing various persuasive strategies for different personality traits in the African population. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Advancements in technology offer new opportunities for the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes. Venture capital companies have been investing in digital diabetes companies that offer digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). However, little is known about the scientific evidence underpinning such interventions or the degree to which these interventions leverage novel technology-driven automated developments such as conversational agents (CAs) or just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) approaches. Objective: Our objectives were to identify the top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes management and prevention, review the level of scientific evidence underpinning the DBCIs, identify which DBCIs are recognized as evidence-based programs by quality assurance authorities, and examine the degree to which these DBCIs include novel automated approaches such as CAs and JITAI mechanisms. Methods: A systematic search was conducted using 2 venture capital databases (Crunchbase Pro and Pitchbook) to identify the top-funded companies offering interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention and management. Scientific publications relating to the identified DBCIs were identified via PubMed, Google Scholar, and the DBCIs' websites, and data regarding intervention effectiveness were extracted. The Diabetes Prevention Recognition Program (DPRP) of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention in the United States was used to identify the recognition status. The DBCIs' publications, websites, and mobile apps were reviewed with regard to the intervention characteristics. Results: The 16 top-funded companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes received a total funding of US $2.4 billion as of June 15, 2021. Only 4 out of the 50 identified publications associated with these DBCIs were fully powered randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Further, 1 of those 4 RCTs showed a significant difference in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) outcomes between the intervention and control groups. However, all the studies reported HbA1c improvements ranging from 0.2% to 1.9% over the course of 12 months. In addition, 6 interventions were fully recognized by the DPRP to deliver evidence-based programs, and 2 interventions had a pending recognition status. Health professionals were included in the majority of DBCIs (13/16, 81%,), whereas only 10% (1/10) of accessible apps involved a CA as part of the intervention delivery. Self-reports represented most of the data sources (74/119, 62%) that could be used to tailor JITAIs. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the level of funding received by companies offering DBCIs for type 2 diabetes prevention and management does not coincide with the level of evidence on the intervention effectiveness. There is considerable variation in the level of evidence underpinning the different DBCIs and an overall need for more rigorous effectiveness trials and transparent reporting by quality assurance authorities. Currently, very few DBCIs use automated approaches such as CAs and JITAIs, limiting the scalability and reach of these solutions. © Roman Keller, Sven Hartmann, Gisbert Wilhelm Teepe, Kim-Morgaine Lohse, Aishah Alattas, Lorainne Tudor Car, Falk Müller-Riemenschneider, Florian von Wangenheim, Jacqueline Louise Mair, Tobias Kowatsch.

AB  - Existing research shows that it is effective for the persuader to personalize persuasion based on the persuadee’s personality. However, prior studies overlooked the interactions of multiple personality traits, which undermines the effectiveness of personalization. In this paper, we investigated the utility of personality types for predicting behavioral intention and personalizing persuasion. The personality types are constructed by categorizing subjects based on the interactions of their Big Five personality traits. Using these personality types as predictors, we then examined how they improved model fitting and prediction accuracy compared to personality traits. Specifically, we used the online survey data of 3,116 Japanese participants to build nine prediction models and confirmed that (1) personality type is a significant factor in personalizing strategies and predicting behavioral intention, and (2) personality types should be appropriately applied according to the prediction model’s complexity when personalizing persuasive strategies. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Sleep is one of the most important areas for humans for maintaining daily activities with full concentration and attention. Maintaining the proper sleep patterns is strongly related to physical, mental, cognitive, and physiological well-being. On the other hand, poor sleep patterns may lead to several diseases, affecting both physiological and cognitive functions, which causes worsened general health conditions. For that reason, it is important to understand subjects' sleep behavior and analyzing changes in sleep characteristics has become one a research area, where the different major reasons and causes, which are directly or indirectly responsible for sleep deprivation, need to be identified. All these reasons increase the demands for a brief comparative analysis of the sleep monitoring system. This chapter mainly focuses on the different methods and procedures for analyzing sleep behavior changes in the different stages of sleep. The authors also briefly focus on how the age and gender of subjects may affect their sleep quality. The chapter also offers a systematic review of how artificial intelligence techniques make sleep stage classifications easier. Another important aspect of this chapter is a brief analysis of the different biosignals and their clinical characteristics to measure sleep irregularities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Childhood obesity is a widespread medical condition and presents a formidable challenge for public health. Long-term treatment strategies and early prevention strategies are required because obese children are more likely to carry this condition into adulthood, increasing their risk of developing other major health disorders. The present review analyses various technological interventions available for childhood obesity prevention and treatment. It also examines whether machine learning and technological interventions can play vital roles in its management. Twenty-six studies were shortlisted for the review using various technological strategies and analysed regarding their efficacy. While most of the selected studies showed positive outcomes, there was a lack of studies using robots and artificial intelligence to manage obesity in children. The use of machine learning was observed in various studies, and the integration of social robots and other efficacious strategies may be effective for treating childhood obesity in the future. © 2022 Alotaibi et al.

AB  - The adoption of robotic vacuum cleaners (RVCs) has drastically increased. During interaction with these embodied autonomous agents, humans tend to ascribe certain personality traits to them even when the roboth as a mechanoid appearance and low degree of freedom. As the social capabilities and the persuasiveness of robots increase, the design of robot personality will become important. This paper investigates the impact of expressive motions on people's perception of robot personality. The framework of Laban Effort Features was implemented for a simple cleaning task. Movement features were programmed in iRobotCreate2, and participants were asked to rate the robot's personality in an online survey. The results indicated that Flow factor was closely associated with neuroticism ratings, Weight factor impacted both agreeableness and conscientiousness ratings, while Time factor impacted only the agreeableness ratings. Movement characteristics should be considered when designing personality into domestic service robots like RVCs, which are expected to operate in highly social settings. © 2022 by Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - In the last decades, Artificial intelligence (AI) systems have been increasingly adopted in assistive (possibly collaborative) decision-making tools. In particular, AI-based persuasive technologies are designed to steer/influence users’ behaviour, habits, and choices to facilitate the achievement of their own - predetermined - goals. Nowadays, the inputs received by the assistive systems leverage heavily AI data-driven approaches. Thus, it is imperative to have transparent and understandable (to the user) both the process leading to the recommendations and the recommendations. The Explainable AI (XAI) community has progressively contributed to “opening the black box”, ensuring the interaction’s effectiveness, and pursuing the safety of the individuals involved. However, principles and methods ensuring the efficacy and information retain on the human have not been introduced yet. The risk is to underestimate the context dependency and subjectivity of the explanations’ understanding, interpretation, and relevance. Moreover, even a plausible (and possibly expected) explanation can lead to an imprecise or incorrect outcome or its understanding. This can lead to unbalanced and unfair circumstances, such as giving a financial advantage to the system owner/provider and the detriment of the user. This paper highlights that the sole explanations - especially in the context of persuasive technologies - are not self-sufficient to protect users’ psychological and physical integrity. Conversely, explanations could be misused, becoming themselves a tool of manipulation. Therefore, we suggest characteristics safeguarding the explanation from being manipulative and legal principles to be used as criteria for evaluating the operation of XAI systems, both from an ex-ante and ex-post perspective. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Autism, also known as pervasive developmental disorder or autism spectrum disorder, is a group of clinical syndromes of developmental delay or impairment. Social impairment, verbal communication impairment, and behavioral impairment are the three conditions for the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, according to the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. According to relevant statistics, about 1 in 100 children is now diagnosed with autism, and their rehabilitation treatment is also valued by people from all walks of life. In the rehabilitation training of autistic children, it is found that the rehabilitation training of autistic children should pay attention to the role of parents and family environment. It is crucial that parents receive systematic training and act as partners in the development of the intervention plan. Research shows that a specific structured education and skills training program for parents of children with autism can be beneficial in improving behavioral problems, functional communication, and symptoms of autism in children with autism. To this end, this paper has completed the following work: Secondly, a portion of the systematic training of CA parents is discussed, followed by an explanation of the structure and principles of BPNN. Finally, the BPNN is utilized to create a model for assessing the impact of systematic parent instruction on CA. The experimental findings suggest that the proposed BPNN outperforms the competition.  © 2022 Xuejin He et al.

AB  - Background: Leveraging artificial intelligence (AI)-driven apps for health education and promotion can help in the accomplishment of several United Nations sustainable development goals. SnehAI, developed by the Population Foundation of India, is the first Hinglish (Hindi + English) AI chatbot, deliberately designed for social and behavioral changes in India. It provides a private, nonjudgmental, and safe space to spur conversations about taboo topics (such as safe sex and family planning) and offers accurate, relatable, and trustworthy information and resources. Objective: This study aims to use the Gibson theory of affordances to examine SnehAI and offer scholarly guidance on how AI chatbots can be used to educate adolescents and young adults, promote sexual and reproductive health, and advocate for the health entitlements of women and girls in India. Methods: We adopted an instrumental case study approach that allowed us to explore SnehAI from the perspectives of technology design, program implementation, and user engagement. We also used a mix of qualitative insights and quantitative analytics data to triangulate our findings. Results: SnehAI demonstrated strong evidence across fifteen functional affordances: Accessibility, multimodality, nonlinearity, compellability, queriosity, editability, visibility, interactivity, customizability, trackability, scalability, glocalizability, inclusivity, connectivity, and actionability. SnehAI also effectively engaged its users, especially young men, with 8.2 million messages exchanged across a 5-month period. Almost half of the incoming user messages were texts of deeply personal questions and concerns about sexual and reproductive health, as well as allied topics. Overall, SnehAI successfully presented itself as a trusted friend and mentor; the curated content was both entertaining and educational, and the natural language processing system worked effectively to personalize the chatbot response and optimize user experience. Conclusions: SnehAI represents an innovative, engaging, and educational intervention that enables vulnerable and hard-to-reach population groups to talk and learn about sensitive and important issues. SnehAI is a powerful testimonial of the vital potential that lies in AI technologies for social good. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - After a cardiac event, secondary prevention is recommended to foster recovery and reduce the risk of recurrent events. European guidelines and EAPC position statements on prevention of cardiovascular diseases recommend a holistic approach that actively engages patients by using shared decision making (SDM). It has been demonstrated that telerehabilitation can be a feasible and effective add-on or alternative compared to conventional in-hospital secondary prevention. However, till date, there is no eHealth solution that offers a holistic approach for secondary prevention that includes SDM. In this paper, we present the CoroPrevention-SDM approach, a technology-supported shared decision making approach for a comprehensive secondary prevention program for cardiac patients. The CoroPrevention Tool Suite consists of three applications that support patients and caregivers in following this approach: 1) a caregiver dashboard that includes decision support systems and supports SDM, 2) a patient mobile application that supports patients in making behaviour changes in their daily life, and 3) an extended ePRO application that collects patient reported outcomes and patient preferences. In a formative usability study, we assessed patients’ and caregivers’ opinion about our approach. The study indicated that both are willing to use our proposed approach to collaboratively set behavioural goals during SDM encounters.

AB  - Morbid obesity in association with comorbidities is a considerable burden for the healthcare systems worldwide. Long-term weight loss maintenance requires sustainable behavioral changes but poor adherence is a significant problem in obesity care today and patients often relapse. Prior research has found conversational agents with of a humanoid representation (avatar) embodying the role of a virtual coach useful for the interface of health behavior change support systems. Regarding the avatar design, the coach could, e.g., take the role of an obese “peer buddy” or a lean “expert”. Based on requirements and design principles derived from the literature, the present study investigates how the avatar should be designed. Therefore, two patient surveys were conducted to evaluate static and dynamic representations of potential coaches. The results suggest that patients welcome the concept and lean “expert” coaches might be more suitable in an obesity context. Design implications for future research are derived and discussed. © 2022 IEEE Computer Society. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter explores how innovative narratives, supported by a combination of playful approaches and technological convergence, provide a reconfiguration of digital news storytelling. Newsgames integrate two opposing logics: the culture of journalism, based on truthfulness and credibility, and the culture of games, characterized by the creation of imaginary worlds, persuasion and mechanics. We analyse The Ocean Game (2019) and The Amazon Race (2019), which use different procedural strategies. We examine the development of gamification in journalistic storytelling, which uses game elements to enhance the user experience. The relationship that gamified news products establish with the audience illuminates changes in the rhetorical and structural dynamics between the news organization, the media workers, and the users. Thus, innovation in journalistic narrative through gamification and newsgames might translate into effective ways of producing content that combines rigour in substance with attractiveness in form, while preserving journalistic quality and incorporating the playful elements of games. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The development of music in games brings attractiveness and spreads the gaming industry. Music plays a vital role in the games to attract user attitudes toward gaming. The gaming industry is more beneficial than any other industry, like the film industry using music in-game. The evolution of music in games started a few decades ago and brought a lot of enhancement in gaming. Nowadays, a player likes music-based games more than any other game because while playing music-based games, it releases stress and keeps comfortable of player’s mind. The music in games changes the previous gaming style and advances, which help the young generation, learn something new from different games. Music is used to attract user attitudes and ultimately involve users in gaming during playing games. Music is utilized in-game to develop a more attractive and memorable game to enhance users’ interest in playing games. In addition, the usage of background music in games is also a primary part of successful games because, at a similar time, game developers and those who play games hope that video games can be more persuasive. After studying the previous paper, it identified that music in games positively impacts players’ performance and achievement, improves the player’s skills, and keeps players relaxed during playing games. The current research has considered the decision support system (DSS) for evaluating the role of music in games for sustained effectiveness. Results of the study have shown the efficacy of the study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming healthcare operations. Nevertheless, particularly in the context of preventive care, little is known about how laypeople perceive and accept AI and change their behavior accordingly. Grounded in a solid theoretical framework of trust, this study bridges this gap by exploring individuals’ acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions and following health behavior change, which is critical for preventive care providers’ operational and business performance. Through a randomized field experiment with 15,000 users of a mobile health app complemented by a survey, we first show that the use and disclosure of AI in preventive health interventions improve their effectiveness. However, individuals are less likely to accept and achieve the health behavior change suggested by AI than when they receive similar interventions from health experts. We also observe that the effectiveness of AI-based interventions can be improved by combining them with human expert opinions, increasing their algorithmic transparency, or emphasizing their genuine care and warmth. These results collectively suggest that, different from conventional technologies, AI's deficient affective trust, rather than comparable cognitive trust, play a decisive role in the acceptance of AI-based preventive health interventions. This study sheds light on the literature on the role of new-age information technologies in behavioral operations management, consumer marketing, and healthcare as well as the role of trust in technology acceptance. Valuable practical implications for more effective management of AI for preventive care operations and promotion of consumers’ health behavior are also provided. © 2022 Production and Operations Management Society.

AB  - The rise of the Internet and smartphones in the 21st century has created and developed social media as an extremely effective means of communication in society. In life, business, sports, and politics, social media facilitates the democratization of ideas like never before. Social media content gives consumers different information sources that they must decipher to discern its trustworthiness and influence in their own opinions. Marketers must be savvy about using social media in their attempts to persuade consumers and build brand equity. As social media has permeated our everyday lives, scholars in various disciplines are actively conducting research into this aspect regarding our way of life. In this scholarly endeavor, marketing has taken a leading role in this research endeavor as a discipline involving human communications and idea persuasion. Thus, rather than considering social media broadly across multiple disciplines, in this monograph, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. This monograph comprises the following four sections: • First, we provide an overview of social media and social media analytics (SMA). While much has already been said about social media generally, relatively less has been said about social media analytics. Thus, much of our focus is on SMA in terms of contributing to the current understanding of SMA in the field. • Second, we concentrate on social media analytics in marketing. We discuss practical industry perspectives and examples, as well as recent marketing research by academics. Notably, we show how analytics may be used to address concerns about social media privacy and help detect fake reviews. • Third, we summarize common tools for social media analytics in marketing. These methods can be complex, but they must be mastered for sound SMA practice. They encompass big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, text analytics, and visual analytics. • Fourth, we discuss trends and a future research agenda. We also discuss how SMA might be better integrated into higher education. © 2022 S. Moon and D. Iacobucci

AB  - Technological embeddedness into everyday life and interconnectivity between omnipresent devices, termed the Internet of Things (IoT), have spurned a dedicated research venture in the field of mental health. Recognizing that mental health issues are on an alarming rise, affecting the individual and the society in a progressively multi-faceted nature, and that existing human resources are not sufficient to tackle the crisis, decision-makers have turned to technology to see what opportunities it may offer. More than ever, this endeavor has gained importance due to the COVID-19 pandemic, whose consequences not only severed the already fickle live human contact between the professionals and their patients but also onset a broad mental health crisis stemming from the virus’ impact on health and the implemented measures to control it. The role that IoT-enabled technology plays in this new landscape of digital mental health can be roughly divided into two complementary processes: assessment and intervention. Assessment concerns monitoring, learning about, and recognizing a person’s mental health issues through their physiology, behavior, thinking, emotional and cognitive states, and the context they live in. Intervention follows, and it conforms to the specifics of an assessment, attempting to effect attitude and behavior change in a person. Technology, especially artificial intelligence, enables assessment and intervention to be tailored very specifically to the individual. Omnipresent devices—e.g., smart bracelets—allow increasingly more accurate assessments, which allow not only better interventions but also interventions that can be delivered momentarily—e.g., with an intelligent cognitive assistant on a smartphone—with the continuous interchange of both as the biggest leap forward. Due to the research field still being young and thus not systematized into a coherent framework, even lacking an overview of methods, trends, and directions, this book chapter serves as an early attempt to codify this highly interdisciplinary relationship between technology and mental health. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This book offers a wide-scale, interdisciplinary analysis and guide to social media and political communication, examining the political use of social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. From disinformation to artificial intelligence, Jeremy Lipschultz explores how social media tools are being deployed by “good” and “bad” political actors. The use of “fake news” or disinformation is clearly contextualized for readers within a wider understanding of the historic uses of propaganda, persuasion and political advertising. Lipschultz also examines how social media is used by activists and social movements to increase civic engagement and amplify social issues. The book surveys traditional media communication theories and methods, exploring newsgatekeeping, propaganda, persuasion and personal influence, and diffusion of new technologies and ideas, teaching vital critical thinking methods for consuming, engaging with, and understanding political social media content from a media literacy perspective. It also includes social network analyses which offer visual representations of social media crowds that influence social movements and political change. Essential reading for students of Media and Cultural Studies, Communication, Journalism, Political Science, and Information Technology, as well as anyone wishing to understand the current intersection of social media and politics. © 2023 Jeremy Harris Lipschultz.

AB  - Recently, the epistemic quality of algorithms and its normative implications have come under scrutiny. While general questions of justice have been addressed in this context, specific issues of epistemic (in)justice have so far been neglected. We aim to fill this gap by analyzing some potential implications of behavioral intelligent neurotechnology (B-INT). We claim that B-INT exhibits a number of epistemic features implying the potential for certain epistemic problems, which, in turn, are likely to result in instances of epistemic injustice. To support this claim, we will first introduce and specify the terminology and technology behind B-INT. Second, we will present four fictitious scenarios of using B-INT and highlight a number of epistemic issues that might arise. Third, we will discuss their relation to the concept of epistemic justice, as well as potential instances thereof. Thus, we will show some important and morally relevant implications of the epistemic properties of INT. © 2021 The Association for Social Economics.

AB  - Since online discussion platforms can limit the perception of social cues, effective collaboration over videochat requires additional attention to conversational skills. However, self-affirmation and defensive bias theories indicate that feedback may appear confrontational, especially when users are not motivated to incorporate them. We develop a feedback chatbot that employs Motivational Interviewing (MI), a directive counseling method that encourages commitment to behavior change, with the end goal of improving the user's conversational skills. We conduct a within-subject study with 21 participants in 8 teams to evaluate our MI-agent 'MIA' and a non-MI-agent 'Roboto'. After interacting with an agent, participants are tasked with conversing over videochat to evaluate candidate résumés for a job circular. Our quantitative evaluation shows that the MI-agent effectively motivates users, improves their conversational skills, and is likable. Through a qualitative lens, we present the strategies and the cautions needed to fulfill individual and team goals during group discussions. Our findings reveal the potential of the MI technique to improve collaboration and provide examples of conversational tactics important for optimal discussion outcomes. © 2022 ACM.

AB  - The development of large and super-large language models, such as GPT-3, T5, Switch Transformer, ERNIE, etc., has significantly improved the performance of text generation. One of the important research directions in this area is the generation of texts with arguments. The solution of this problem can be used in business meetings, political debates, dialogue systems, for preparation of student essays. One of the main domains for these applications is the economic sphere. The key problem of the argument text generation for the Russian language is the lack of annotated argumentation corpora. In this paper, we use translated versions of the Argumentative Microtext, Persuasive Essays and UKP Sentential corpora to fine-tune RuBERT model. Further, this model is used to annotate the corpus of economic news by argumentation. Then the annotated corpus is employed to fine-tune the ruGPT-3 model, which generates argument texts. The results show that this approach improves the accuracy of the argument generation by more than 20 percentage points (63.2% vs. 42.5%) compared to the original ruGPT-3 model. © 2022 ABBYY PRODUCTION LLC.

An experiment was conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the results of which showed that it increases the defending behavior of a user who was temporarily hijacked by the chatbot. However, compared with the existing method, the proposed method was found to have a problem with the continued use of the system.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Social robots must take on many roles when interacting with people in everyday settings, some of which may be authoritative, such as a nurse, teacher, or guard. It is important to investigate whether and how authoritative robots can influence people in applications ranging from health care and education to security and in the home. Here, we present a human-robot interaction study that directly investigates the effect of a robot's peer or authority role (formal authority) and control of monetary rewards and penalties (real authority) on its persuasive influence. The study consisted of a social robot attempting to persuade people to change their answers to the robot's suggestion in a series of challenging attention and memory tasks. Our results show that the robot in a peer role was more persuasive than when in an authority role, contrary to expectations from human-human interactions. The robot was also more persuasive when it offered rewards over penalties, suggesting that participants perceived the robot's suggestions as a less risky option than their own estimates, in line with prospect theory. In general, the results show an aversion to the persuasive influence of authoritative robots, potentially due to the robot's legitimacy as an authority figure, its behavior being perceived as dominant, or participant feelings of threatened autonomy. This paper explores the importance of persuasion for robots in different social roles while providing critical insight into the perception of robots in these roles, people's behavior around these robots, and the development of human-robot relationships. © 2021 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

AB  - With voice user interfaces (VUIs) becoming ubiquitous and speech synthesis technology maturing, it is possible to synthesise voices to resemble our friends and relatives (which we will collectively call 'kin') and use them on VUIs. However, designing such interfaces and investigating how the familiarity of kin voices affect user perceptions remain under-explored. Our surveys and interviews with 25 users revealed that VUIs using kin voices were perceived as more engaging, persuasive and safer yet eerier than VUIs using common virtual assistant voices. We then developed a technology probe, KinVoice, an Alexa-based VUI that was deployed in three households over two weeks. Users set reminders using KinVoice, which in turn, gave the reminders in synthesised kin voices. This was to explore users' needs, uncover challenges involved and inspire new applications. We discuss design guidelines for integrating familiar kin voices into VUIs, applications that benefit from its usage, and implications for balancing voice realism and usability with security and diversification.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Several marine species have developed a magnetic perception that is essential for navigation and detection of prey and predators. One of these species is the transparent glass catfish that contains an ampullary organ dedicated to sense magnetic fields. Here we examine the behavior of the glass catfish in response to static magnetic fields which will provide valuable insight on function of this magnetic response. By utilizing state of the art animal tracking software and artificial intelligence approaches, we quantified the effects of magnetic fields on the swimming direction of glass catfish. The results demonstrate that glass catfish placed in a radial arm maze, consistently swim away from magnetic fields over 20 μT and show adaptability to changing magnetic field direction and location.

AB  - Introduction Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory and degenerative disease of the central nervous system that mainly affects young adults. Uncertainty is a major psychological burden of the disease from diagnosis to prognosis, enhanced by the pressure to make early decisions on a diverse set of immunotherapies. Watchful waiting for 1-2 years while adapting goals and lifestyle habits to life with a chronic disease represents another reasonable option for persons with MS (PwMS). A behaviour change programme based on evidence-based patient information (EBPI) is not available in standard care. This randomised controlled trial (RCT) with an embedded process evaluation investigates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based behavioural lifestyle programme to change lifestyle behaviour and reduce inflammatory disease activity in PwMS. Methods and analysis A web-based behavioural intervention will be evaluated in an RCT aiming to recruit 328 persons with clinically isolated syndrome, suspected MS or confirmed MS for less than 1 year, who have not yet started immunotherapy. Moreover, a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation will be carried out. Participants will be recruited in at least 16 MS centres across Germany and randomised to an intervention group with 12 months of access to EBPI about lifestyle factors in MS, combined with a complex behaviour change programme or to a control group (optimised standard care). The combined primary endpoint is the incidence of new T2 lesions on MRI or confirmed relapses. Ethics and dissemination The study has been approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hamburg Chamber of Physicians (PV6015). Trial results will be communicated at scientific conferences and meetings and presented on relevant patient websites and in patient education seminars.

AB  - Background: Immunization directly impacts health (SDG3) and brings a contribution to 14 out of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), such as ending poverty, reducing hunger, and reducing inequalities. Therefore, immunization is recognized to play a central role in reaching the SDGs, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Despite continuous interventions to strengthen immunization systems and to adequately respond to emergency immunization during epidemics, the immunization-related indicators for SDG3 lag behind in sub-Saharan Africa. Especially taking into account the current Covid19 pandemic, the current performance on the connected SDGs is both a cause and a result of this. Methods: We conduct a literature review through a keyword search strategy complemented with handpicking and snowballing from earlier reviews. After title and abstract screening, we conducted a qualitative analysis of key insights and categorized them according to showing the impact of immunization on SDGs, sustainability challenges, and model-based solutions to these challenges. Results: We reveal the leveraging mechanisms triggered by immunization and position them vis-à-vis the SDGs, within the framework of Public Health and Planetary Health. Several challenges for sustainable control of vaccine-preventable diseases are identified: access to immunization services, global vaccine availability to LMICs, context-dependent vaccine effectiveness, safe and affordable vaccines, local/regional vaccine production, public-private partnerships, and immunization capacity/capability building. Model-based approaches that support SDG-promoting interventions concerning immunization systems are analyzed in light of the strategic priorities of the Immunization Agenda 2030. Conclusions: In general terms, it can be concluded that relevant future research requires (i) design for system resilience, (ii) transdisciplinary modeling, (iii) connecting interventions in immunization with SDG outcomes, (iv) designing interventions and their implementation simultaneously, (v) offering tailored solutions, and (vi) model coordination and integration of services and partnerships. The research and health community is called upon to join forces to activate existing knowledge, generate new insights and develop decision-supporting tools for Low-and Middle-Income Countries’ health authorities and communities to leverage immunization in its transformational role toward successfully meeting the SDGs in 2030. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - While wearable and mobile chemical sensors have experienced tremendous growth over the past decade, their potential for tracking and guiding nutrition has emerged only over the past three years. Currently, guidelines from doctors and dietitians represent the most common approach for maintaining optimal nutrition status. However, such recommendations rely on population averages and do not take into account individual variability in responding to nutrients. Precision nutrition has recently emerged to address the large heterogeneity in individuals' responses to diet, by tailoring nutrition based on the specific requirements of each person. It aims at preventing and managing diseases by formulating personalized dietary interventions to individuals on the basis of their metabolic profile, background, and environmental exposure. Recent advances in digital nutrition technology, including calories-counting mobile apps and wearable motion tracking devices, lack the ability of monitoring nutrition at the molecular level. The realization of effective precision nutrition requires synergy from different sensor modalities in order to make timely reliable predictions and efficient feedback. This work reviews key opportunities and challenges toward the successful realization of effective wearable and mobile nutrition monitoring platforms. Non-invasive wearable and mobile electrochemical sensors, capable of monitoring temporal chemical variations upon the intake of food and supplements, are excellent candidates to bridge the gap between digital and biochemical analyses for a successful personalized nutrition approach. By providing timely (previously unavailable) dietary information, such wearable and mobile sensors offer the guidance necessary for supporting dietary behavior change toward a managed nutritional balance. Coupling of the rapidly emerging wearable chemical sensing devices - generating enormous dynamic analytical data - with efficient data-fusion and data-mining methods that identify patterns and make predictions is expected to revolutionize dietary decision-making toward effective precision nutrition.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Occupational therapy focuses on therapeutic means to address participation in meaningful everyday tasks across the lifespan. No single setting is more conducive to this pursuit than individuals’ authentic contexts. Occupational therapists are therefore uniquely suited to lead the charge toward stimulating research and advancing evidence-based application of telehealth. To this end, the American Occupational Therapy Foundation digitally convened their 2020 Planning Grant Collective to focus on the topic of Telehealth. Participants of the interdisciplinary collective collaboratively identified four themes: (1) Using technology to assess and intervene in the everyday context, (2) Partnerships with caregivers, (3) Telehealth delivery, and (4) Uniform data collection. Subgroups explored potential research and funding opportunities in their specialty area while also addressing the centralizing concepts of equity and diversity of telehealth delivery and COVID-19. Here, we provide a summary of the key concepts and recommendations from the 3 days of collaboration. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Background: Diabetes mellitus is a major health problem among people with physical disabilities. Health coaching has been proven to be an effective approach in terms of behavioral changes, patient self-efficacy, adherence to treatment, health service use, and health outcomes. Telehealth systems combined with health coaching have the potential to improve the quality of health care by increasing access to services. Treatment fidelity is particularly important for behavior change studies; however, fidelity protocols are inadequately administered and reported in the literature. Objective: The aim of this study is to outline all the intervention fidelity strategies and procedures of a telecoaching intervention-artificial intelligence for diabetes management (AI4DM)-which is a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a telehealth platform in adults with type 2 diabetes and permanent impaired mobility. AI4DM aims to create a web-based disability-inclusive diabetes self-management program. We selected the National Institutes of Health Behavior Change Consortium (NIH BCC) fidelity framework to describe strategies to ensure intervention fidelity in our research. Methods: We have developed fidelity strategies based on the five fidelity domains outlined by the NIH BCC-focusing on study design, provider training, treatment delivery, treatment receipt, and enactment of treatment skills. The design of the study is grounded in the social cognitive theory and is intended to ensure that both arms would receive the same amount of attention from the intervention. All providers will receive standardized training to deliver consistent health coaching to the participants. The intervention will be delivered through various controlling and monitoring strategies to reduce differences within and between treatment groups. The content and structure of the study are delivered to ensure comprehension and participation among individuals with low health literacy. By constantly reviewing and monitoring participant progress and protocol adherence, we intend to ensure that participants use cognitive and behavioral skills in real-world settings to engage in health behavior. Results: Enrollment for AI4DM will begin in October 2021 and end in October 2022. The results of this study will be reported in late 2022. Conclusions: Developing and using fidelity protocols in behavior change studies is essential to ensure the internal and external validity of interventions. This study incorporates NIH BCC recommendations into an artificial intelligence embedded telecoaching platform for diabetes management designed for people with physical disabilities. The developed fidelity protocol can provide guidance for other researchers conducting telehealth interventions within behavioral health settings to present more consistent and reproducible research. © 2021 JMIR Publications Inc..

AB  - Workplace environments have a significant impact on worker performance, health, and well-being. With machine learning capabilities, artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed to automate individualized adjustments to work environments (e.g., lighting, temperature) and to facilitate healthier worker behaviors (e.g., posture). Worker perspectives on incorporating AI into office workspaces are largely unexplored. Thus, the purpose of this study was to explore office workers’ views on including AI in their office workspace. Six focus group interviews with a total of 45 participants were conducted. Interview questions were designed to generate discussion on benefits, challenges, and pragmatic considerations for incorporating AI into office settings. Sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using an iterative approach. Two primary constructs emerged. First, participants shared perspectives related to preferences and concerns regarding communication and interactions with the technology. Second, numerous conversations highlighted the dualistic nature of a system that collects large amounts of data; that is, the potential benefits for behavior change to improve health and the pitfalls of trust and privacy. Across both constructs, there was an overarching discussion related to the intersections of AI with the complexity of work performance. Numerous thoughts were shared relative to future AI solutions that could enhance the office workplace. This study’s findings indicate that the acceptability of AI in the workplace is complex and dependent upon the benefits outweighing the potential detriments. Office worker needs are complex and diverse, and AI systems should aim to accommodate individual needs. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Emotional persuasion based on an Agent's trust can better utilize a variety of artificial intelligence advantages of an Agent. Aiming at the currently insufficient research on decision models, based on an Agent's own character, emotion decay and external stimulation, the algorithm of emotional intensity was constructed by using the big five characters, the OCC(Ortony, Clore, Collins) emotion model and the first law of emotional intensity. Considering the effects of transaction quality on trust, fuzzification and defuzzification were carried out on the transaction quality of an Agent by using the language evaluation method, the triangular fuzzy number and the Converting Fuzzy data into Crisp Scores Converting Fuzzy data into Crisp Scores(CFCS) algorithm, and then the algorithm of the transaction quality was correspondingly constructed. After the existing updating factor of trust is improved, the updating algorithm of an Agent's trust was developed. On the basis of the aforementioned algorithms, the emotional persuasion decision model based on an Agent's trust was established with TOmada de Decisao Interativa e Multicritévio(TODIM) method, and the attribute weights in the model were determined by the entropy weight method. To show the appropriateness and validity of the proposed model, a numerical example was designed for illustration, and the decision results obtained from different combinations of parameter values were analyzed and compared with those of the related research. Conclusions and managerial insights were drawn accordingly and then limitations and future research directions were further summarized. © 2021, Editorial Department of CIMS. All right reserved.

AB  - Conversational interfaces that interact with humans need to continuously establish, maintain and repair common ground in task-oriented dialogues. Uncertainty, repairs and acknowledgements are expressed in user behaviour in the continuous efforts of the conversational partners to maintain mutual understanding. Users change their behaviour when interacting with systems in different forms of embodiment, which affects the abilities of these interfaces to observe users’ recurrent social signals. Additionally, humans are intellectually biased towards social activity when facing anthropomorphic agents or when presented with subtle social cues. Two studies are presented in this paper examining how humans interact in a referential communication task with wizarded interfaces in different forms of embodiment. In study 1 (N = 30), we test whether humans respond the same way to agents, in different forms of embodiment and social behaviour. In study 2 (N = 44), we replicate the same task and agents but introduce conversational failures disrupting the process of grounding. Findings indicate that it is not always favourable for agents to be anthropomorphised or to communicate with non-verbal cues, as human grounding behaviours change when embodiment and failures are manipulated. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This research paper discusses on the phishing websites Prevention and Detection. A phishing website is a common social engineering method that mimics trustful uniform resource locators (URLs) and webpages. Phishing is the most commonly used social engineering and cyber-attack. Through such attacks, the phisher targets naïve online users by tricking them into revealing confidential information, with the purpose of using it fraudulently. In our paper we will be discussing and listing a few of the artificial intelligence models, that will help us to detect these phishing websites so that in the future these data and techniques can be used in machine learning to make our system better and efficient. The problem of phishing is widespread and there is no particular single solution available to effectively reduce all vulnerabilities, so many techniques are often used to reduce certain attacks. Machine learning is a useful tool used to reduce phishing attacks.As innovation keeps on developing, phishing strategies began to advance quickly several anti-phishing tools are available and have their own disadvantages. The paper concentrates on basic Machine learning supervised classification techniques to seek out an answer to phishing attacks. The Basic principle of this paper is to execute the frameworks with good efficiency, exactness, and cost-effectively. The task is attained by using 4 ML managed classification models. The four classification models are KNN, Kernel-SVM, Rando Forest Classifier and Decision tree. The supervised classification contains a labeled dataset that is used to train the models. All the four algorithms used: KNN, Kernel-SVM, Rando Forest Classifier and Decision tree are classification models. With machine learning, cybersecurity systems can analyze patterns and learn from them to assist prevent similar attacks and answer changing behavior. It can help users to be more active in preventing threats and respond to active attacks in real-time. So, by using Machine Learning, we could progress towards preventing such attacks. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Research has shown study habits and skills to be correlated with academic success, calling for a deeper comprehension of these behaviors and processes to design effective interventions for struggling students. Chatbots have recently been used as a persuasive technology to help support behavioral change, making them an intriguing design space for students' study habits and skills. This paper investigated the feasibility of using chatbots for promoting behavioral change of college students majoring in Computer Science (CS). We conducted semi-structured interviews with CS peer-tutors and surveyed university freshmen to understand students' study habits and identify technical intervention opportunities. Inspired by the findings, we designed StudyBuddy, a chatbot prototype deployed in Slack that periodically sends tips, provides assessments of students' study habits via surveys, helps the students break down assignments, recommends academic resources, and sends reminders. We evaluated the usability of the prototype in-depth with 8 students (both first-year and senior students) and 5 course instructors followed by a large scale evaluative survey (n=117) using video of the prototype. Our research identified important design challenges such as building trust and preserving privacy, limiting interaction costs, and supporting both immediate and long-term sustainable support. Likewise, we proposed design recommendations that demonstrate context awareness, personalize the experience based on user preferences, and adapt over time as students mature and grow. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - This concise text provides an accessible introduction to artificial intelligence and intelligent user interfaces (IUIs) and how they are at the heart of a communication revolution for strategic communications and public relations. IUIs are where users and technology meet - via computers, phones, robots, public displays, etc. They use AI and machine learning methods to control how those systems interact, exchange data, learn from, and develop relations with users. The authors explore research and developments that are already changing human/machine engagement in a wide range of areas from consumer goods, healthcare, and entertainment to community relations, crisis management, and activism. They also explore the implications for public relations of how technologies developing hyper-personalised persuasion could be used to make choices for us, navigating the controversial space between influence, nudging, and controlling. This readable overview of the applications and implications of AI and IUIs will be welcomed by researchers, students, and practitioners in all areas of strategic communication, public relations, and communications studies. © 2022 Simon Moore and Roland Hübscher.

AB  - Since the early recognition of Persuasive Technologies, the notion of digital design with the intent to influence and change attitudes and behaviors has evolved tremendously. Digital influence and behavior design is now recognize in a variety of theoretical and methodological approaches, and behavior design is continuously influencing more complex application domains. With the development of the field emerges a need for clearer understanding of these different design approaches, their possibilities and limitations, in order for designers to identify and apply the best approach depending on the intent and context. In this paper, we discuss some of the primary overlaps between Nudging and Persuasive Design. Moreover, we point towards research in neuroscience in order to highlight a potential need to reconsider central elements of persuasive design, such as efficient praise and rewards. The aim of the paper is to contribute to the ongoing discussion about the role of behavior design in digital media, and the ethical considerations that emerge from this domain. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Introduction: Many adults do not reach the recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines, which can lead to serious health problems. A promising method to increase PA is the use of smartphone PA applications. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple PA apps, it remains unclear how to develop and design engaging and effective PA apps. Furthermore, little is known on ways to harness the potential of artificial intelligence for developing personalized apps. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the Playful data-driven Active Urban Living (PAUL): a personalized PA application. Methods: The two-phased development process of the PAUL apps rests on principles from the behavior change model; the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework; and the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model. During the first phase, we explored whether location-specific information on performing PA in the built environment is an enhancement to a PA app. During the second phase, the other modules of the app were developed. To this end, we first build the theoretical foundation for the PAUL intervention by performing a literature study. Next, a focus group study was performed to translate the theoretical foundations and the needs and wishes in a set of user requirements. Since the participants indicated the need for reminders at a for-them-relevant moment, we developed a self-learning module for the timing of the reminders. To initialize this module, a data-mining study was performed with historical running data to determine good situations for running. Results: The results of these studies informed the design of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) application for running, walking, and performing strength exercises. The app is implemented as a set of modules based on the persuasive strategies “monitoring of behavior,” “feedback,” “goal setting,” “reminders,” “rewards,” and “providing instruction.” An architecture was set up consisting of a smartphone app for the user, a back-end server for storage and adaptivity, and a research portal to provide access to the research team. Conclusions: The interdisciplinary research encompassing psychology, human movement sciences, computer science, and artificial intelligence has led to a theoretically and empirically driven leisure time PA application. In the current phase, the feasibility of the PAUL app is being assessed. © Copyright © 2021 Sporrel, De Boer, Wang, Nibbeling, Simons, Deutekom, Ettema, Castro, Dourado and Kröse.

AB  - Personalised nutrition is a novel public health strategy aiming to promote positive diet and lifestyle changes. Tailored dietary and physical activity advice may be more appropriate than a generalised ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach as it is more biologically relevant to the individual. Information and computing technology, smartphones and mobile applications have become an integral part of modern life and thereby present the opportunity for novel methods to encourage individuals to lead a healthier lifestyle. This article introduces the European Union-funded PROTEIN project (PeRsOnalised nutriTion for hEalthy livINg) consortium and introduces the associated work packages. The primary objective of the PROTEIN project is to produce a novel adaptable mobile application suite based on sound nutrition and physical activity advice from experts in their field, accessible to all population groups, with differing health outcomes, whose behaviour can be tracked with a variety of sensors and health hazard perception. The mobile application ‘ecosystem’ that will be developed by the consortium includes a platform, mobile suite, cloud services, artificial intelligence advisor, game suite, modelling of expert’s knowledge, users’ behaviour data collection, data analysis and a dashboard for healthcare professionals. It is proposed that users will find the provision of personalised nutrition advice and real-time data capture through a smartphone application useful, and importantly, will be encouraged by this to make positive health behaviour changes. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Healthy behaviors are crucial for maintaining a person’s health and well-being. The effects of health behavior interventions are mediated by individual and contextual factors that vary over time. Recently emerging smartphone-based ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) can use real-time user reports (ecological momentary assessments [EMAs]) to trigger appropriate support when needed in daily life. Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the characteristics of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs in relation to their effects on health behaviors, user engagement, and user perspectives. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and CINAHL in June 2019 and updated the search in March 2020. We included experimental studies that incorporated EMIs based on EMAs delivered through smartphone apps to promote health behaviors in any health domain. Studies were independently screened. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed. We performed a narrative synthesis of intervention effects, user perspectives and engagement, and intervention design and characteristics. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included studies. Results: We included 19 papers describing 17 unique studies and comprising 652 participants. Most studies were quasi-experimental (13/17, 76%), had small sample sizes, and great heterogeneity in intervention designs and measurements. EMIs were most popular in the mental health domain (8/17, 47%), followed by substance abuse (3/17, 18%), diet, weight loss, physical activity (4/17, 24%), and smoking (2/17, 12%). Of the 17 studies, the 4 (24%) included randomized controlled trials reported nonstatistically significant effects on health behaviors, and 4 (24%) quasi-experimental studies reported statistically significant pre-post improvements in self-reported primary outcomes, namely depressive (P<.001) and psychotic symptoms (P=.03), drinking frequency (P<.001), and eating patterns (P=.01). EMA was commonly used to capture subjective experiences as well as behaviors, whereas sensors were rarely used. Generally, users perceived EMIs to be helpful. Common suggestions for improvement included enhancing personalization, multimedia and interactive capabilities (eg, voice recording), and lowering the EMA reporting burden. EMI and EMA components were rarely reported and were not described in a standardized manner across studies, hampering progress in this field. A reporting checklist was developed to facilitate the interpretation and comparison of findings and enhance the transparency and replicability of future studies using EMAs and EMIs. Conclusions: The use of smartphone-delivered EMIs using self-reported EMAs to promote behavior change is an emerging area of research, with few studies evaluating efficacy. Such interventions could present an opportunity to enhance health but need further assessment in larger participant cohorts and well-designed evaluations following reporting checklists. Future research should explore combining self-reported EMAs of subjective experiences with objective data passively collected via sensors to promote personalization while minimizing user burden, as well as explore different EMA data collection methods (eg, chatbots). © Kim Phuong Dao, Katrien De Cocker, Huong Ly Tong, A Baki Kocaballi, Clara Chow, Liliana Laranjo.

AB  - Visual media have important persuasive power, but prior computer vision approaches have predominantly ignored the persuasive aspects of images. In this work, we propose a suite of data and techniques that enable progress on understanding the messages that visual advertisements convey. We make available a dataset of 64,832 image ads and 3,477 video ads, annotated with ten types of information: the topic and sentiment of the ad; whether it is funny, exciting, or effective; what action it prompts the viewer to do, and what arguments it provides for why this action should be taken; symbolic associations that the ad relies on; the metaphorical object transformations on which especially creative ads rely; and the climax in video ads. We develop methods that use multimodal cues, i.e., both visuals and slogans, for both the image and video domains. Our methods rely on finding poignant content spatially and temporally. We also examine the creative story construction in ads: for videos, we learn to predict when the climax occurs (if any), and how effective the story is; for images, we analyze how object transformations in ads metaphorically depict product properties. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Within the emerging context of using interactive conversational agents (CAs) to persuade and activate individuals' behavior changes, it is important to understand how to design CAs to engage in effective communication and generate positive social response. Drawing upon the social response theory and elaboration likelihood model for persuasion literature, we investigate the interaction effects of anthropomorphic CA design and issue involvement of recipients on the perceived persuasion as well as behavioral intention. We suggest that for individuals of low issue involvement, CAs with visual social cues are more effective, while CAs with verbal social cues are more effective in persuading high issues involved individuals of the recommended behavior. We will evaluate the persuasive and human-like CA design by conducting a 3x2 experiment. We believe that this study will significantly contribute to the theoretical landscape of anthropomorphic design and human-AI interaction, and provide important practical contributions for CA designers. © ICIS 2020.

AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) provide an interface modality on smartphones that may be particularly effective for tasks with significant social, affective, reflective, and narrative aspects, such as health education and behavior change counseling. However, the conversational medium is significantly slower than conventional graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for brief, time-sensitive tasks. We conducted a randomized experiment to determine user preferences in performing two kinds of health-related tasks - one affective and narrative in nature and one transactional - and gave participants a choice of a conventional GUI or a functionally equivalent ECA on a smartphone to complete the task. We found significant main effects of task type and user preference on user choice of modality, with participants choosing the conventional GUI more often for transactional and time-sensitive tasks. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - In this paper we provide an account of the burden of persuasion in the context of structured argumentation. A formal model for the burden of persuasion is defined, discussed, and used to capture the role of the burden of persuasion in adjudicating conflicts between conflicting arguments and in determining the dialectical status of arguments. We consider how our model can also capture adversarial burdens of proof, namely, those cases in which failure to establish an argument for a proposition burdened with persuasion entails establishing the complementary proposition.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Social comparison-based features are widely used in social computing apps. However, most existing apps are not grounded in social comparison theories and do not consider individual differences in social comparison preferences and reactions. This paper is among the first to automatically personalize social comparison targets. In the context of an m-health app for physical activity, we use artificial intelligence (AI) techniques of multi-armed bandits. Results from our user study (n=53) indicate that there is some evidence that motivation can be increased using the AI-based personalization of social comparison. The detected effects achieved small-to-moderate effect sizes, illustrating the real-world implications of the intervention for enhancing motivation and physical activity. In addition to design implications for social comparison features in social apps, this paper identified the personalization paradox, the conflict between user modeling and adaptation, as a key design challenge of personalized applications for behavior change. Additionally, we propose research directions to mitigate this Personalization Paradox.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - In the near future, our deeply connected and fully digitized physical facilities require cognitive processes that are embodied in a regular sensing of living environments. Pervasive sensor networks will enable the development of more efficient technologies that will integrate Artificial Intelligence based services better into psychosocial and human ecological contexts. These innovative mixed and integrated biophysical and digital living spaces enable to use them more efficiently, conveniently, and, furthermore, to interpret these new intelligent environments in a completely different way. Based on the growing insight into relations between human beings and their surroundings, residents get an overview of their building ecosphere. They obtain the potential to develop strategies in context with intelligent buildings that are enabled to assist in changing behaviors in everyday life. We study human factors, in particular, the potential of change in human behavior in such fully integrated services, strongly related to our living and work place in the case of home office. After using these sentient cognitive environments, we explore novel ways of interacting with living and work spaces by offering opportunities to give intelligent environments a virtual voice and representation via the digital data space. During the COVID-19 pandemic, people should pay more attention to their immediate living and working environment: it becomes more important to monitor the quality of the air to breathe, surroundings are made visible to get to know them better, cope better, enjoy them, etc. The presented work provides in this context quantitative data from novel low-cost biosensors, such as for measuring carbon dioxide concentration distribution, highlighting the presence and attention of residents and their change in behavior within a sample living space, and also provides conclusions towards novel research pathways for integrating cognitive processes into a network of IoT devices and ambient biosensor technologies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The evolution of healthcare, together with the changing behaviour of healthcare professionals, means that medical affairs functions of pharmaceutical organisations are constantly reinventing themselves. The emergence of digital ways of working, expedited by the COVID-19 pandemic, means that pharmaceutical–healthcare relationships are evolving to operate in an increasingly virtual world. The value of the pharmaceutical medical affairs function is dependent on understanding customers’ needs and providing the right knowledge at the right time to physicians. This requires a human-centric artificial intelligence (AI) approach for medical affairs, which allows the function to query internal and external data sets in a conversational format and receive timely, accurate and concise intelligence on their customers. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The recent advances in artificial intelligence namely in machine learning and deep learning, have boosted the performance of intelligent systems in several ways. This gave rise to human expectations, but also created the need for a deeper understanding of how intelligent systems think and decide. The concept of explainability appeared, in the extent of explaining the internal system mechanics in human terms. Recommendation systems are intelligent systems that support human decision making, and as such, they have to be explainable to increase user trust and improve the acceptance of recommendations. In this study, we focus on a context-aware recommendation system for energy efficiency and develop a mechanism for explainable and persuasive recommendations, which are personalized to user preferences and habits. The persuasive facts either emphasize on the economical saving prospects (Econ) or on a positive ecological impact (Eco) and explanations provide the reason for recommending an energy saving action. Based on a study conducted using a Telegram bot, different scenarios have been validated with actual data and human feedback. Current results show a total increase of 19% on the recommendation acceptance ratio when both economical and ecological persuasive facts are employed. This revolutionary approach on recommendation systems, demonstrates how intelligent recommendations can effectively encourage energy saving behavior. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Conversational agents (CAs) are effective tools for health behavior change, yet little research investigates the mechanisms through which they work. In accordance with the Computer as Social Actors (CASA) paradigm, we suggest that agents are perceived as human-like actors and hence influence behavior much as human coaches might. As such, agents should be designed to resemble ideal interaction patterns—for example, by resembling their users. Our study will test this paradigm by testing the impact of customization on similarity and reciprocity, which in turn are hypothesized to improve perceptions of the agent and compliance with the agent's recommendations. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Background: This systematic review aimed to evaluate AI chatbot characteristics, functions, and core conversational capacities and investigate whether AI chatbot interventions were effective in changing physical activity, healthy eating, weight management behaviors, and other related health outcomes. Methods: In collaboration with a medical librarian, six electronic bibliographic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, ACM Digital Library, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and IEEE) were searched to identify relevant studies. Only randomized controlled trials or quasi-experimental studies were included. Studies were screened by two independent reviewers, and any discrepancy was resolved by a third reviewer. The National Institutes of Health quality assessment tools were used to assess risk of bias in individual studies. We applied the AI Chatbot Behavior Change Model to characterize components of chatbot interventions, including chatbot characteristics, persuasive and relational capacity, and evaluation of outcomes. Results: The database search retrieved 1692 citations, and 9 studies met the inclusion criteria. Of the 9 studies, 4 were randomized controlled trials and 5 were quasi-experimental studies. Five out of the seven studies suggest chatbot interventions are promising strategies in increasing physical activity. In contrast, the number of studies focusing on changing diet and weight status was limited. Outcome assessments, however, were reported inconsistently across the studies. Eighty-nine and thirty-three percent of the studies specified a name and gender (i.e., woman) of the chatbot, respectively. Over half (56%) of the studies used a constrained chatbot (i.e., rule-based), while the remaining studies used unconstrained chatbots that resemble human-to-human communication. Conclusion: Chatbots may improve physical activity, but we were not able to make definitive conclusions regarding the efficacy of chatbot interventions on physical activity, diet, and weight management/loss. Application of AI chatbots is an emerging field of research in lifestyle modification programs and is expected to grow exponentially. Thus, standardization of designing and reporting chatbot interventions is warranted in the near future.

AB  - Background: Healthy behavior is an essential component in type 2 diabetes (T2D) management. Promoting healthy lifestyle is one of the priorities of primary health care in Oman. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention in promoting physical activity (PA) and healthy diet and its implications on body mass index and glycemic control in adults with diabetes attending primary care. Methods: A one year 1:1 cluster randomized controlled trial will be utilized to compare the use of phone consultations, a multi component interactive phone application and pedometers with the usual diabetes care on promoting PA and healthy diet. Participants will be screened for inactivity and should be T2D, aged18–65 years, and overweight or obese. Eight primary centers will be randomly selected in each arm (n = 375). The primary outcome is the between arms differences in PA and diet scores, BMI and HbA1c over 12 months from baseline. Additionally, secondary outcomes will include cardiovascular outcomes (BP, and lipids). The trial has received ethical approval from the Omani Research and Ethical Review and Approval Committee. All eligible participants will be invited to their respected health centers to provide informed consent. Discussion: This study will contribute to the integration of healthy lifestyle approach using artificial intelligence to primary diabetes care. Results from this study will be disseminated through workshops, policy briefs, and peer-reviewed publications, local and international conferences.

AB  - Embodied conversational agents are often included in health behaviour change applications as intelligent virtual coaches. A major challenge in their development is tailoring coaching dialogues to user profiles. Agents should collect information about the user and consequently adapt the strategy that guides their interactions. Previous research discovered relations between users’ motivation profiles and potential effective coaching strategies. In the current paper, we describe an experiment with multiple agents that tests if users with certain motivation profiles prefer certain (tailored) strategies. Participants were classified into four motivation groups (Intrinsic Motivation, External Regulation, Dual Motivation, A-motivation), following their responses to a questionnaire on motivation towards healthy living. Then, two coaches suggested a positively and a negatively tailored strategy. Participants rated these and chose their favourite. Results (N = 108) show that the Dual Motivation group appreciated their positively tailored strategy more than their negatively tailored strategy, while intrinsically motivated participants appreciated both strategies. Furthermore, agents' likeability does not seem to influence strategy appreciation, while there was an effect of participant's age and gender. We conclude that coaching strategies for dialogues with agents can be tailored to personal motivation to live healthy. Future research should focus on performing a long-term study in a real-life setting. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Users nowadays seem to be more aware of the dangers of giving their data to other entities. However, people are easily influenced and can still provide personal data, leading to fraud, data theft, or worse. Extending social chatbots to influence people can prove efficient as they can act as malicious friends. These conversational agents can be used in various domains such as news, e-commerce, or therapy. They can come with multiple personalities to accomplish different purposes. However, using phrases that may be offensive or present an excessive amount of anthropomorphic traits can, in some cases, cause harm to the user. This paper presents the realization of a prototype of an educational chatbot that uses different social engineering methods in an attempt to retrieve sensitive information from users. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Techniques from Natural-Language-Processing ofer the opportunities to design new dialog-based forms of human-computer interaction as well as to analyze the argumentation quality of texts. This can be leveraged to provide students with adaptive tutoring when doing a persuasive writing exercise. To test if individual tutoring for students' argumentation will help them to write more convincing texts, we developed ArgueTutor, a conversational agent that tutors students with adaptive argumentation feedback in their learning journey.We compared ArgueTutor with 55 students to a traditional writing tool. We found students using ArgueTutor wrote more convincing texts with a better quality of argumentation compared to the ones using the alternative approach. The measured level of enjoyment and ease of use provides promising results to use our tool in traditional learning settings. Our results indicate that dialog-based learning applications combined with NLP text feedback have a benefcial use to foster better writing skills of students. © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Social media are an integral part of the daily lives of today’s young generation. In addition to the positive impact on learning through these channels, there are also risks related to toxic content like “fake news” on various social media. Fake news aims to change opinions based on disinformation or misinformation supporting conspiracy theories, e.g., related to the pandemic. Fake news creators use various multimedia artifacts, including images taken from serious and valid news sources, to attract the audience’s attention. Tracking images in different contexts can give social media users important clues to distinguish fake news from credible information. We report on the development of a web-based learning environment that includes a “virtual learning companion” to help learners improve their understanding, awareness, and critical thinking concerning such social media threats. The learning environment mimics Instagram and includes toxic and non-toxic content in a controlled way. The companion is implemented as a browser plugin that communicates with students via chat. The companion poses knowledge activation questions and answers according to an underlying script. The companion offers other sources with the same image identified through Reverse Image Search (RIS). The goal is to help learners find the same image in different contexts with different textual descriptions and keywords. For this purpose, we added basic NLP mechanisms to extract keywords from these contexts, including keywords that signal persuasiveness. Currently, we evaluate the impact of this tool and the provided support in distinguishing fake or credible news. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Context. Asynchronous messaging is increasingly used to support human–machine inter-actions, generally implemented through chatbots. Such virtual entities assist the users in activities of different kinds (e.g., work, leisure, and health-related) and are becoming ingrained into humans’ habits due to factors including (i) the availability of mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets, (ii) the increasingly engaging nature of chatbot interactions, (iii) the release of dedicated APIs from messaging platforms, and (iv) increasingly complex AI-based mechanisms to power the bots’ behav-iors. Nevertheless, most of the modern chatbots rely on state machines (implementing conversational rules) and one-fits-all approaches, neglecting personalization, data-stream privacy management, multi-topic management/interconnection, and multimodal interactions. Objective. This work ad-dresses the challenges above through an agent-based framework for chatbot development named EREBOTS. Methods. The foundations of the framework are based on the implementation of (i) multi-front-end connectors and interfaces (i.e., Telegram, dedicated App, and web interface), (ii) enabling the configuration of multi-scenario behaviors (i.e., preventive physical conditioning, smoking cessa-tion, and support for breast-cancer survivors), (iii) online learning, (iv) personalized conversations and recommendations (i.e., mood boost, anti-craving persuasion, and balance-preserving physical exercises), and (v) responsive multi-device monitoring interface (i.e., doctor and admin). Results. EREBOTS has been tested in the context of physical balance preservation in social confinement times (due to the ongoing pandemic). Thirteen individuals characterized by diverse age, gender, and country distribution have actively participated in the experimentation, reporting advancements in the physical balance and overall satisfaction of the interaction and exercises’ variety they have been proposed. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - I am Echoborg is promoted as ‘a show created afresh each time by the audience in conversation with an artificial intelligence (AI)’. The show demonstrates how AI in a creative and performance context can raise questions about the technology’s ethical use for persuasion and compliance, and how humans can reclaim agency. This audience study focuses on a consecutive three-night run in Bristol, UK in October 2019. The different outcomes of each show illustrate the unpredictability of audience interactions with conversational AI and how the collective dynamic of audience members shapes each performance. This study analyses (1) how I am Echoborg facilitates audience cocreation in a live performance context, (2) the show’s capacity to provoke nuanced understandings of the potential for AI and (3) the ability for intelligent technology to facilitate social interaction and group collaboration. This audience study demonstrates how the show inspires debate beyond binary conclusions (i.e. AI as good or bad) and how audiences can understand potential creative uses of AI, including as a tool for cocreating entertainment with (not just for) them. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Regular physical activity (PA) is crucial for well-being; however, healthy habits are difficult to create and maintain. Interventions delivered via conversational agents (eg, chatbots or virtual agents) are a novel and potentially accessible way to promote PA. Thus, it is important to understand the evolving landscape of research that uses conversational agents. Objective: This mixed methods systematic review aims to summarize the usability and effectiveness of conversational agents in promoting PA, describe common theories and intervention components used, and identify areas for further development. Methods: We conducted a mixed methods systematic review. We searched seven electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Scopus, and Web of Science) for quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies that conveyed primary research on automated conversational agents designed to increase PA. The studies were independently screened, and their methodological quality was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool by 2 reviewers. Data on intervention impact and effectiveness, treatment characteristics, and challenges were extracted and analyzed using parallel-results convergent synthesis and narrative summary. Results: In total, 255 studies were identified, 7.8% (20) of which met our inclusion criteria. The methodological quality of the studies was varied. Overall, conversational agents had moderate usability and feasibility. Those that were evaluated through randomized controlled trials were found to be effective in promoting PA. Common challenges facing interventions were repetitive program content, high attrition, technical issues, and safety and privacy concerns. Conclusions: Conversational agents hold promise for PA interventions. However, there is a lack of rigorous research on long-term intervention effectiveness and patient safety. Future interventions should be based on evidence-informed theories and treatment approaches and should address users' desires for program variety, natural language processing, delivery via mobile devices, and safety and privacy concerns. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Five years ago, the Melanoma Research Foundation (MRF) conducted an assessment of the challenges and opportunities facing the melanoma research community and patients with melanoma. Since then, remarkable progress has been made on both the basic and clinical research fronts. However, the incidence, recurrence, and death rates for melanoma remain unacceptably high and significant challenges remain. Hence, the MRF Scientific Advisory Council and Breakthrough Consortium, a group that includes clinicians and scientists, reconvened to facilitate intensive discussions on thematic areas essential to melanoma researchers and patients alike, prevention, detection, diagnosis, metastatic dormancy and progression, response and resistance to targeted and immune-based therapy, and the clinical consequences of COVID-19 for patients with melanoma and providers. These extensive discussions helped to crystalize our understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing the broader melanoma community today. In this report, we discuss the progress made since the last MRF assessment, comment on what remains to be overcome, and offer recommendations for the best path forward. © American Association for Cancer Research.

AB  - Diet coaching is a behaviour change task which requires lots of interaction with patients. E-health apps gathered lots of interest in research and, recently, chatbots have been leveraged to address this task, with a focus on persuasion to motivate people towards behaviour change. In this paper, we take a look at current approaches in building persuasive dieting chatbots and expose a number of major unsolved challenges. We motivate them with evidence from previous work and show that current chatbots don't approach certain scenarios properly, hence limiting their communication and persuasion capabilities.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Objective: Given widespread excitement around predictive analytics and the proliferation of machine learning algorithms that predict outcomes, a key next step is understanding how this information is - or should be - communicated with patients. Materials and Methods: We conducted a scoping review informed by PRISMA-ScR guidelines to identify current knowledge and gaps in this domain. Results: Ten studies met inclusion criteria for full text review. The following topics were represented in the studies, some of which involved more than 1 topic: disease prevention (N = 5/10, 50%), treatment decisions (N = 5/10, 50%), medication harms reduction (N = 1/10, 10%), and presentation of cardiovascular risk information (N = 5/10, 50%). A single study included 6- and 12-month clinical outcome metrics. Discussion: As predictive models are increasingly published, marketed by industry, and implemented, this paucity of relevant research poses important gaps. Published studies identified the importance of (1) identifying the most effective source of information for patient communications; (2) contextualizing risk information and associated design elements based on users' needs and problem areas; and (3) understanding potential impacts on risk factor modification and behavior change dependent on risk presentation. Conclusion: An opportunity remains for researchers and practitioners to share strategies for effective selection of predictive algorithms for clinical practice, approaches for educating clinicians and patients in effectively using predictive data, and new approaches for framing patient-provider communication in the era of artificial intelligence.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: An unhealthy eating pattern and loneliness negatively influence quality of life in older age. Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are a promising way to address these health behaviors in an engaging manner. Objective: We aim to (1) identify whether ECAs can persuade community-dwelling older adults to change their dietary behavior and whether ECA use can decrease loneliness, (2) test these pathways to effects, and (3) understand the use of an ECA. Methods: The web-based eHealth app PACO is a fully automated 8-week intervention in which 2 ECAs engage older adults in dialogue to motivate them to change their dietary behavior and decrease their loneliness. PACO was developed via a human-centered and stakeholder-inclusive design approach and incorporates Self-determination Theory and various behavior change techniques. For this study, an unblinded randomized controlled trial will be performed. There will be 2 cohorts, with 30 participants per cohort. Participants in the first cohort will immediately receive the PACO app for 8 weeks, while participants in the second cohort receive the PACO app after a waiting-list condition of 4 weeks. Participants will be recruited via social media, an online panel, flyers, and advertorials. To be eligible, participants must be at least 65 years of age, must not be in paid employment, and must live alone independently at home. Primary outcomes will be self-assessed via online questionnaires at intake, control, after 4 weeks, and after 8 weeks, and will include eating behavior and loneliness. In addition, the primary outcome-use-will be measured via data logs. Secondary outcomes will be measured at the same junctures, via either validated, self-assessed, online questionnaires or an optional interview. Results: As of July 2020, we have begun recruiting participants. Conclusions: By unraveling the mechanisms behind the use of a web-based intervention with ECAs, we hope to gain a fine-grained understanding of both the effectiveness and the use of ECAs in the health context.

AB  - Theories about human activity and motivation point out that motives are driving forces behind human activities and development of healthy and unhealthy habits. Activity theory is one of these that has been applied to develop activity-centered user interfaces. Activity theory differentiates between sense-making and stimuli-oriented types of motives that have a strong influence on our daily behavior. Two main challenges are explored in this paper: 1) the personalisation of graphical user interfaces to mediate representations of motivation-based activities to support behaviour change processes; and 2) the proactiveness of such visual representations.As methods, we use activity theory as a framework for defining the motivations' dynamics, and formal argumentation theory as the underlying mechanism for interactive reasoning and decision-making in the process of generating the user interface.Our contributions are two-folded: 1) a dynamic graphical user interface where the background responds to behaviors linked to sense-making motives, and the foreground to stimuli motivation; and 2) a non-monotonic reasoning mechanism endowing the user interface with proactiveness (not only react to the user interactions but trigger and direct attention to potential conflicts), and a motive-based behavior conflict resolution process. Future work includes user studies to explore how triggering of focus may create increased awareness in an individual of conflicting motives in daily activities and how this may support changes of unhealthy habits.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Current developments in Artificial Intelligence (AI) led to a resurgence of Explainable AI (XAI). New methods are being researched to obtain information from AI systems in order to generate explanations for their output. However, there is an overall lack of valid and reliable evaluations of the effects on users' experience of, and behavior in response to explanations. New XAI methods are often based on an intuitive notion what an effective explanation should be. Rule- and example-based contrastive explanations are two exemplary explanation styles. In this study we evaluate the effects of these two explanation styles on system understanding, persuasive power and task performance in the context of decision support in diabetes self-management. Furthermore, we provide three sets of recommendations based on our experience designing this evaluation to help improve future evaluations. Our results show that rule-based explanations have a small positive effect on system understanding, whereas both rule- and example-based explanations seem to persuade users in following the advice even when incorrect. Neither explanation improves task performance compared to no explanation. This can be explained by the fact that both explanation styles only provide details relevant for a single decision, not the underlying rational or causality. These results show the importance of user evaluations in assessing the current assumptions and intuitions on effective explanations. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A biological understanding is key for managing medical conditions, yet psychological and social aspects matter too. The main problem is that these two aspects are hard to quantify and inherently difficult to communicate. To quantify psychological aspects, this work mined around half a million Reddit posts in the sub-communities specialised in 14 medical conditions, and it did so with a new deep-learning framework. In so doing, it was able to associate mentions of medical conditions with those of emotions. To then quantify social aspects, this work designed a probabilistic approach that mines open prescription data from the National Health Service in England to compute the prevalence of drug prescriptions, and to relate such a prevalence to census data. To finally visually communicate each medical condition's biological, psychological, and social aspects through storytelling, we designed a narrative-style layered Martini Glass visualization. In a user study involving 52 participants, after interacting with our visualization, a considerable number of them changed their mind on previously held opinions: 10% gave more importance to the psychological aspects of medical conditions, and 27% were more favourable to the use of social media data in healthcare, suggesting the importance of persuasive elements in interactive visualizations. © 1995-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Background: The rising incidence of chronic diseases is a growing concern, especially in Singapore, which is one of the high-income countries with the highest prevalence of diabetes. Interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes have been proven to be effective in reducing the progression of prediabetes to diabetes, but their in-person delivery may not be feasible on a large scale. Novel technologies such as conversational agents are a potential alternative for delivering behavioral interventions that promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes to the public. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the feasibility and acceptability of using a conversational agent promoting healthy lifestyle behavior changes in the general population in Singapore. Methods: We performed a web-based, single-arm feasibility study. The participants were recruited through Facebook over 4 weeks. The Facebook Messenger conversational agent was used to deliver the intervention. The conversations focused on diet, exercise, sleep, and stress and aimed to promote healthy lifestyle behavior changes and improve the participants’ knowledge of diabetes. Messages were sent to the participants four times a week (once for each of the 4 topics of focus) for 4 weeks. We assessed the feasibility of recruitment, defined as at least 75% (150/200) of our target sample of 200 participants in 4 weeks, as well as retention, defined as 33% (66/200) of the recruited sample completing the study. We also assessed the participants’ satisfaction with, and usability of, the conversational agent. In addition, we performed baseline and follow-up assessments of quality of life, diabetes knowledge and risk perception, diet, exercise, sleep, and stress. Results: We recruited 37.5% (75/200) of the target sample size in 1 month. Of the 75 eligible participants, 60 (80%) provided digital informed consent and completed baseline assessments. Of these 60 participants, 56 (93%) followed the study through till completion. Retention was high at 93% (56/60), along with engagement, denoted by 50% (30/60) of the participants communicating with the conversational agent at each interaction. Acceptability, usability, and satisfaction were generally high. Preliminary efficacy of the intervention showed no definitive improvements in health-related behavior. Conclusions: The delivery of a conversational agent for healthy lifestyle behavior change through Facebook Messenger was feasible and acceptable. We were unable to recruit our planned sample solely using the free options in Facebook. However, participant retention and conversational agent engagement rates were high. Our findings provide important insights to inform the design of a future randomized controlled trial. ©Dhakshenya Ardhithy Dhinagaran, Thirunavukkarasu Sathish, AiJia Soong, Yin-Leng Theng, James Best, Lorainne Tudor Car.

AB  - Microscopic modeling of human driving consists generally in combining both car-following and lane-change models. While the human car-following process has been extensively developed and well modeled, the lane-change behavior is more complex to understand and still remains to be explored. Classical lane-change models are usually rule-based and handcrafted, that tend to exhibit limited performance. Machine Learning algorithms, particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL) ones, provide an alternative approach and have recently achieved high success in modeling difficult decision-making processes in many fields. We propose in this article a reinforcement learning based model for the human lane-change behavior, with an online calibration of real lane-change decisions, extracted from the NGSIM data-set. In addition, we use the traffic vehicular simulator SUMO ("Simulation of Urban Mobility") to create a numerical simulation environment. The utilization of numerical traffic simulation allows us enriching the data-set, for training the agent to find an optimal policy for lane change. Thus, about 13% additional traffic situations, not present in the real data, are created by the traffic simulation environment. The trained agent is collision-free and human-like who is satisfactory to real data and also to the additional simulated data. Moreover, our RL model can perform up to 95.37% of the real decisions observed in the data-set. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The use of chatbots may increase engagement with digital behavior change interventions in youth by providing human-like interaction. Following a Person-Based Approach (PBA), integrating user preferences in digital tool development is crucial for engagement, whereas information on youth preferences for health chatbots is currently limited. Objective: The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of adolescents' expectations and preferences for health chatbots and describe the systematic development of a health promotion chatbot. Methods: Three studies in three different stages of PBA were conducted: (1) a qualitative focus group study (n = 36), (2) log data analysis during pretesting (n = 6), and (3) a mixed-method pilot testing (n = 73). Results: Confidentiality, connection to youth culture, and preferences when referring to other sources were important aspects for youth in chatbots. Youth also wanted a chatbot to provide small talk and broader support (e.g., technical support with the tool) rather than specifically in relation to health behaviors. Despite the meticulous approach of PBA, user engagement with the developed chatbot was modest. Conclusion: This study highlights that conducting formative research at different stages is an added value and that adolescents have different chatbot preferences than adults. Further improvement to build an engaging chatbot for youth may stem from using living databases. Copyright © 2021 Maenhout, Peuters, Cardon, Compernolle, Crombez and DeSmet.

AB  - Background: The management of procedural pain in infants is suboptimal, in part, compounded by the scarcity of a simple, accurate, and reliable method of assessing such pain. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the PainChek Infant, a point-of-care mobile application that uses automated facial evaluation and analysis in the assessment of procedural pain in infants. Methods: Video recordings of 40 infants were randomly chosen from a purposely assembled digital library of 410 children undergoing immunisation as part of their standard care in Prishtina, Kosovo, between April 4, 2017, and July 11, 2018. For each infant recording, four 10 s video segments were extracted, corresponding to baseline, vaccine preparation, during vaccination, and recovery. Four trained assessors did pain assessments on the video segments of 30 infants, using PainChek Infant standard, PainChek Infant adaptive, the Neonatal Facial Coding System-Revised (NFCS-R) single, the NFCS-R multiple, and the Observer administered Visual Analogue Scale (ObsVAS), on two separate occasions. PainChek Infant's performance was compared to NFCS-R and ObsVAS using correlation in changes in pain scores, intra-rater and inter-rater reliability, and internal consistency. Findings: 4303 pain assessments were completed in two separate testing sessions, on Aug 31, and Oct 19, 2020. The study involved videos of 40 infants aged 2·2–6·9 months (median age 3·4 months [IQR 2·3–4·5]). All pain assessment tools showed significant changes in the recorded pain scores across the four video segments (p≤0·0006). All tools were found to be responsive to procedure-induced pain, with the degree of change in pain scores not influenced by pre-vaccination pain levels. PainChek Infant pain scores showed good correlation with NFCS-R and ObsVAS scores (r=0·82–0·88; p<0·0001). PainChek Infant also showed good to excellent inter-rater reliability (ICC=0·81–0·97, p<0·001) and high levels of internal consistency (α=0·82–0·97). Interpretation: PainChek Infant's use of automated facial expression analysis could offer a valid and reliable means of assessing and monitoring procedural pain in infants. Its clinical utility in clinical practice requires further research. Funding: PainChek. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd. This is an Open Access article under the CC BY 4.0 license

AB  - Conversational agents offer promise to provide an alternative to costly and scarce access to human health providers. Particularly in the context of adherence to treatment advice and health behavior change, they can provide an ongoing coaching role to motivate and keep the health consumer on track. Due to the recognized importance of face-to-face communication and establishment of a therapist-patient working alliance as the biggest single predictor of adherence, our review focuses on embodied conversational agents (ECAs) and their use in health and well-being interventions. The article also introduces ECAs who provide explanations of their recommendations, known as explainable agents (XAs), as a way to build trust and enhance the working alliance towards improved behavior change. Of particular promise, is work in which XAs are able to engage in conversation to learn about their user and personalize their recommendations based on their knowledge of the user and then tailor their explanations to the beliefs and goals of the user to increase relevancy and motivation and address possible barriers to increase intention to perform the healthy behavior. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose of Review: The purpose of this review is to explore the evolution and outcomes of premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) while reviewing strategies for effective screening of those at high risk for developing this disease. Recent Findings: Premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) affects a population of patients not typically identified as high risk by current risk stratification guidelines or traditional risk calculation tools. Not only does PCAD represent a large proportion of overall cardiovascular disease, it also afflicts a population in which the rate of mortality from cardiovascular disease has plateaued despite an overall declining population-wide cardiovascular mortality rate. There is ample opportunity for behavioral change strategies, screening tools, adapted imaging modalities, and precision pharmacotherapies to be more precisely targeted toward those at highest risk for premature coronary artery disease. Summary: Premature coronary artery disease (PCAD) is pervasive and not frequently represented within contemporary risk calculation models. Providers should pursue proactive screening and aggressive risk factor modification and deploy appropriate preventative therapies in caring for younger populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Conversational agents or chatbots are computer programs that simulate conversations with users. Conversational agents are increasingly used for delivery of behavior change interventions in health care. Behavior change is complex and comprises the use of one or several components collectively known as behavioral change techniques (BCTs). Objective: The objective of this scoping review is to identify the BCTs that are used in behavior change-focused interventions delivered via conversational agents in health care. Methods: This scoping review will be performed in line with the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology and will be reported according to the PRISMA extension for scoping reviews guidelines. We will perform a comprehensive search of electronic databases and grey literature sources, and will check the reference lists of included studies for additional relevant studies. The screening and data extraction will be performed independently and in parallel by two review authors. Discrepancies will be resolved through consensus or discussion with a third review author. We will use a data extraction form congruent with the key themes and aims of this scoping review. BCTs employed in the included studies will be coded in line with BCT Taxonomy v1. We will analyze the data qualitatively and present it in diagrammatic or tabular form, alongside a narrative summary. Results: To date, we have designed the search strategy and performed the search on April 26, 2021. The first round of screening of retrieved articles is planned to begin soon. Conclusions: Using appropriate BCTs in the design and delivery of health care interventions via conversational agents is essential to improve long-term outcomes. Our findings will serve to inform the development of future interventions in this area. © Laura Martinengo, Nicholas Y W Lo, Westin I W T Goh, Lorainne Tudor Car.

AB  - There is an absolute need for technology in our daily life that makes people busy with their smartphones all day long. In the healthcare field, mobile apps have been widely used for the treatment of many diseases. Most of these apps were designed without considering health behavior change models. Celiac disease is a significant public health problem worldwide. In Saudi Arabia, the incidence of celiac disease is 1.5%. Celiac patients have a natural demand for resources to facilitate care and research; however, they have not received much attention in the field of healthcare apps. This study introduced a new health behavior change model based on the existing common models and adapted it to the use of technology for the changing behavior of celiac patients towards healthy suitable food. As proof of concept, the new model was applied to the WhatsApp chatbot for patients with celiac disease. To test the impact of the chatbot, 60 Saudi celiac patients participated in three steps. First, they completed a pre-test questionnaire. Then, the participants were divided into two groups: the control group, which was left without any intervention, and the test group, who used the chatbot for 90 days. Finally, all participants completed the post-test questionnaire. The results confirmed a significant statistical difference between both groups, and the test group improved their healthy life in terms of eating habits, reduced celiac symptoms, and commitment to the treatment plan. © 2021

AB  - Overweight, obesity and cardiometabolic diseases are major global health concerns. Lifestyle factors, including diet, have been acknowledged to play a key role in the solution of these health risks. However, as shown by numerous studies, and in clinical practice, it is extremely challenging to quantify dietary behaviors as well as influencing them via dietary interventions. As shown by the limited success of ‘one-size-fits-all’ nutritional campaigns catered to an entire population or subpopulation, the need for more personalized coaching approaches is evident. New technology-based innovations provide opportunities to further improve the accuracy of dietary assessment and develop approaches to coach individuals towards healthier dietary behaviors. Pride & Prejudice (P&P) is a unique multi-disciplinary consortium consisting of researchers in life, nutrition, ICT, design, behavioral and social sciences from all four Dutch Universities of Technology. P&P focuses on the development and integration of innovative technological techniques such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, conversational agents, behavior change theory and personalized coaching to improve current practices and establish lasting dietary behavior change. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Developing an adequate and human-like virtual agent has been one of the primary applications of artificial intelligence. In the last few years, task-oriented dialogue systems have gained huge popularity because of their upsurging relevance and positive outcomes. In real-world, users may not always have a predefined and rigid task goal beforehand; they upgrade/downgrade/change their goal component dynamically depending upon their utility value and agent's serving capability. However, existing virtual agents fail to incorporate this dynamic behavior, leading to either unsuccessful task completion or an ungratified user experience. The paper presents an end to end multimodal dialogue system for dynamic and co-operative goal setting, which incorporates i) a multi-modal semantic state representation in policy learning to deal with multi-modal inputs, ii) a goal manager module in a traditional dialogue manager for handling dynamic and goal unavailability scenarios effectively, iii) an accumulative reward (task/persona/sentiment) for task success, personalized persuasion and user-adaptive behavior, respectively. The obtained experimental results and the comparisons with baselines firmly establish the need and efficacy of the proposed system. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Over the last five years, several scholars from a range of disciplines have started to analyse how Artificial Intelligence (AI) affects businesses outcomes. This research effort has produced many predictions on the expected impact of automation on labour demand and equilibrium employment. However, most of the expected results are dependent on how businesses change their behaviour due to adopting AI. We argue that, as AI diffuses across the economy, changing behaviour is a necessary outcome for incumbents: the argument is that the diffusion of AI across an industry generates the conditions for a process of value migration from incumbents to new entrants (Helper et al., 2018); in these cases, the only mechanism available to incumbents to offset the negative impact of the migration process is by changing the architecture of their business, i.e., the business model. However, companies can choose from several AI-driven business models; their preference for one model is driven by many industry-level factors such as technical standards, the structure of the technology industry and the presence of an ethical framework for the use of AI. This monologue summarises the existing literature on business model innovation and AI; it then analyses the industry-level factors that may shape the business-level preference for specific business models. Finally, the monologue offers some suggestions for future research in the area. © 2021 Now Publishers Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Importance: Healthy nutrition and appropriate supplementation during preconception have important implications for the health of the mother and newborn. The best way to deliver preconception care to address health risks related to nutrition is unknown. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of data from a randomized controlled trial designed to study the impact of conversational agent technology in 13 domains of preconception care among 528 non-pregnant African American and Black women. This analysis is restricted to those 480 women who reported at least one of the ten risks related to nutrition and dietary supplement use. Interventions: An online conversational agent, called “Gabby”, assesses health risks and delivers 12 months of tailored dialogue for over 100 preconception health risks, including ten nutrition and supplement risks, using behavioral change techniques like shared decision making and motivational interviewing. The control group received a letter listing their preconception risks and encouraging them to talk to a health care provider. Results: After 6 months, women using Gabby (a) reported progressing forward on the stage of change scale for, on average, 52.9% (SD, 35.1%) of nutrition and supplement risks compared to 42.9% (SD, 35.4) in the control group (IRR 1.22, 95% CI 1.03–1.45, P = 0.019); and (b) reported achieving the action and maintenance stage of change for, on average, 52.8% (SD 37.1) of the nutrition and supplement risks compared to 42.8% (SD, 37.9) in the control group (IRR 1.26, 96% CI 1.08–1.48, P = 0.004). For subjects beginning the study at the contemplation stage of change, intervention subjects reported progressing forward on the stage of change scale for 75.0% (SD, 36.3%) of their health risks compared to 52.1% (SD, 47.1%) in the control group (P = 0.006). Conclusion: The scalability of Gabby has the potential to improve women’s nutritional health as an adjunct to clinical care or at the population health level. Further studies are needed to determine if improving nutrition and supplement risks can impact clinical outcomes including optimization of weight.

AB  - In the human interaction with CAs, research has shown that elements of persuasive system design, such as praise, are perceived differently when compared to traditional graphical interfaces. In this experimental study, we will extend our knowledge regarding the relation of persuasiveness (namely dialog support), anthropomorphically designed CAs, and task performance. Within a three-conditions-between-subjects design, two instances of the CA are applied within an online experiment with 120 participants. Our results show that anthropomorphically designed CAs increase perceived dialog support and performance but adding persuasive design elements can be counterproductive. Thus, the results are embedded in the discourse of CA design for task support. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Based on COVID-19 and Persuasion Communication Theory, this study constructs a research model to analyze the influence of rumors on consumers' irrational purchasing behavior in the context of public crisis. Using an online questionnaire survey, the empirical results show that information quantity, content features, platform credibility, and source credibility all have a significant positive impact on rumor credibility; rumor credibility has a significant positive impact on negative emotion; Negative emotions have a significant positive impact on irrational purchasing behavior. The platform, source, quantity, and content features of rumors will affect people's trust in rumors. Rumors cause social panic and lead to a surge of negative emotion, making people lose rational judgment and make irrational purchasing behavior. These irrational behaviors are largely due to the panic about some rumors, the urgency, and suddenness of public crisis events, making people more willing to believe in the uncertain information and engage in some irrational consumption behaviors. ©Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Many countries are facing significant challenges in relation to providing adequate care for their elderly citizens. The roots of these issues are manifold, but include changing demographics, changing behaviours, and a shortage of resources. As has been witnessed in the health sector and many others in society, technology has much to offer in terms of supporting people’s needs. This paper explores the potential for ambient intelligence to address this challenge by creating a system that is able to passively monitor the home environment, detecting abnormal situations which may indicate that the inhabitant needs help. There are many ways that this might be achieved, but in this paper, we will describe our investigation into an approach involving unobtrusively ’listening’ to sound patterns within the home, which classifies these as either normal daily activities, or abnormal situations. The experimental system we built was composed of an innovative combination of acoustic sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet-of-Things (IoT), which we argue in the paper that it provides a cost-effective approach to alerting care providers when an elderly person in their charge needs help. The majority of the innovation in our work concerns the AI in which we employ Machine Learning to classify the sound profiles, analyse the data for abnormal events, and to make decisions for raising alerts with carers. A Neural Network classifier was used to train and identify the sound profiles associated with normal daily routines within a given person’s home, signalling departures from the daily routines that were then used as templates to measure deviations from normality, which were used to make weighted decisions regarding calling for assistance. A practical experimental system was then designed and deployed to evaluate the methods advocated by this research. The methodology involved gathering pre-design and post-design data from both a professionally run residential home and a domestic home. The pre-design data gathered the views on the system design from 11 members of the residential home, using survey questionnaires and focus groups. These data were used to inform the design of the experimental system, which was then deployed in a domestic home setting to gather post-design experimental data. The experimental results revealed that the system was able to detect 84% of abnormal events, and advocated several refinements which would improve the performance of the system. Thus, the research concludes that the system represents an important advancement to the state-of-the-art and, when taken together with the refinements, represents a line of research which has the potential to deliver significant improvements to care provision for the elderly. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objective: To present an overview of how artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to regulate eating and dietary behaviours, exercise behaviours and weight loss. Design: A scoping review of global literature published from inception to 15 December 2020 was conducted according to Arksey and O'Malley's five-step framework. Eight databases (CINAHL, Cochrane-Central, Embase, IEEE Xplore, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science) were searched. Included studies were independently screened for eligibility by two reviewers with good interrater reliability (k = 0·96). Results: Sixty-six out of 5573 potential studies were included, representing more than 2031 participants. Three tenets of self-regulation were identified - self-monitoring (n 66, 100 %), optimisation of goal setting (n 10, 15·2 %) and self-control (n 10, 15·2 %). Articles were also categorised into three AI applications, namely machine perception (n 50), predictive analytics only (n 6) and real-time analytics with personalised micro-interventions (n 10). Machine perception focused on recognising food items, eating behaviours, physical activities and estimating energy balance. Predictive analytics focused on predicting weight loss, intervention adherence, dietary lapses and emotional eating. Studies on the last theme focused on evaluating AI-assisted weight management interventions that instantaneously collected behavioural data, optimised prediction models for behavioural lapse events and enhance behavioural self-control through adaptive and personalised nudges/prompts. Only six studies reported average weight losses (2·4-4·7 %) of which two were statistically significant. Conclusion: The use of AI for weight loss is still undeveloped. Based on the current study findings, we proposed a framework on the applicability of AI for weight loss but cautioned its contingency upon engagement and contextualisation. © 2021 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Introduction: Multiple sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory, degenerative disease of the central nervous system manifesting at first with relapses in about 85% of cases. In Germany, intravenous therapy with high-dose corticosteroids is the treatment standard of acute relapses. The treatment leads to a faster reduction of symptoms in about 25 of 100 treated patients but has no proven long-term benefits over placebo treatment. Intravenous treatment is not superior to oral treatment. Therefore, informed decisions on relapse management are required. An earlier randomised controlled trial showed that evidence-based patient information and education on relapse management leads to more informed decisions and more relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. This study aims to evaluate whether a web-based relapse management programme will positively change relapse management and strengthen autonomy in people with multiple sclerosis. Methods: The pragmatic double-blind randomised controlled trial is accompanied by a mixed-methods process evaluation and a health economic evaluation and follows the UK Medical Research Council guidance on developing and evaluating complex interventions. A total of 188 people with possible or relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis with ≥ 1 relapse within the last year and/or ≥ 2 relapses within the last 2 years will be recruited and randomised using blocks. The intervention group receives a web- and dialogue-based decision aid on relapse management, a nurse-led webinar and access to a monitored chat forum. The control group receives standard information, which will be made available via the same online platform as the intervention. The primary endpoint is the proportion of relapses not treated or treated with oral corticosteroids. Key secondary endpoints are the annualised relapse rate, decision-making, empowerment, quality of life and cost-effectiveness. Facilitators and barriers will be assessed by mixed-methods process evaluation measures. The study ends when 81 relapses have been documented or after 24 months of observation per individual patient. Analyses will follow the intention-to-treat principle. Discussion: We hypothesise that the intervention will enhance patient empowerment and have a positive impact on patients’ relapse management.

AB  - Personalized recommender systems can provide users with their expected internet resources automatically, rapidly and precisely, based on users' preferences and demands. As the broadly applied information retrieval systems in the big data era, personalized recommender systems have shown great commercial values in various applications. In recent years, the knowledge engineering of big data which takes knowledge graph (KGs) as representative, has become the hot spot in the communities of both industry and academic, thanks to the sharp increasement of the big data on Web, as well as the rapid development and popularization of artificial intelligence technologies. It also promotes recommender systems to step into the phase of being driven and enabled by knowledge. With the rich knowledge in KGs used as valuable side in-formation, the inevitable problems harming traditional recommender systems, such as data sparsity and semantic mismatch, can be addressed well. Moreover, the knowledge is helpful to generate diverse and explainable recommendation results, as well as achieve cross-domain and sequential recommendation. As a result, user experiences in various real recommendation scenarios are enhanced. In this paper, we classify the existing recommendation models incorporating KGs at first, according to their algorithm design and applied recommendation scenarios (tasks), to construct a scientific and reasonable taxonomy. Specifically, according to recommendation algorithm design, we divide the KG-based recommendation models into the class based on feature representation and the class based on graph topology. For recommendation scenarios, we specially focus on diversified recommendation, explainable recommendation, sequential recommendation and cross-domain recommendation. Next, we introduce some representative works respectively for each category, and briefly compare their characteristics including advantages and disadvantages. Furthermore, inspired by the current trend of artificial intelligence technologies and various applications, we also try to forecast the development trend of recommender systems with cognitive intelligence. To be specific, these future recommender systems include the systems built with multimodal knowledge and common sense, as well as the explainable, persuasive and polemical recommender systems. The survey and prospect in this paper can provide constructive preferences for future work in the research field of recommender systems. © 2021, China Science Publishing & Media LTD.

AB  - Background: Pakistan’s immunization uptake rates are still significantly lower than anticipated despite several initiatives. Lack of awareness, forgetting about vaccination schedule, and vaccine misconception/misinformation are a few of the major drivers that mitigate the rates of immunization. The current COVID-19 pandemic emphasizes the importance of immunization. The significant reductions in regular childhood vaccination during pandemic have increased the risk of outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases. Concerns among parents over possibly exposing their children to COVID-19 during child visits may have contributed to the reported declines. Innovative and cost-effective mHealth interventions must be implemented in order to address the problem of inadequate immunization rates. In addition, it is also critical to understand the end user needs in order to reflect on the highly relevant essence of the customized healthcare experience. Objective: The aim of this study was to learn about caregivers’ attitudes toward the usability and acceptability of behavior-change smartphone applications (mobile phones) for improving immunization coverage in Pakistan. Methods: A mixed-method design was employed for this study. The study was conducted at Aga Khan University, Hospital. Parents visiting the Community Health Center for 6-week vaccination of their children were recruited. The study was conducted in two stages. Stage 1 consisted of qualitative interviews that grasped the parent’s attitudes and challenges to immunization, as well as their acceptability and accessibility of the smartphone-based behavior-change application to increase vaccine uptake. Stage 1 was followed by stage 2, in which data were collected through a questionnaire designed by using data from qualitative interviews. Results: The majority of participants agreed that immunization serves an important role in protecting their child from illnesses that cause morbidity and mortality. Almost all of them emphasized the importance of using a pre-appointment method at vaccination center in order to reduce the waiting time. Furthermore, participants were also interested in AI-based behavior modification applications related to immunization. They also wanted to have applications in their native language for better understanding and communication of related information. In our study, approximately 95.2 percent of participants agreed to accept SMS immunization updates, which was also reasonably high. Lastly, the majority of them identified forgetfulness as a significant contributor to regular immunization. Conclusion: To enhance the uptake of childhood vaccines, overall vaccination rates, and overcome barriers related to vaccination coverage, cost-effective and user-friendly mHealth AI-based smart phone applications are required to raise awareness regarding the continuation of vaccination service and the importance of timely vaccination. Parents’ experiences and attitudes must be considered while designing and evaluating the efficacy of mHealth-based interventions. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Conversational agents (CAs) for chronic disease management are receiving increasing attention in academia and the industry. However, long-term adherence to CAs is still a challenge and needs to be explored. Personalization of CAs has the potential to improve long-term adherence and, with it, user satisfaction, task efficiency, perceived benefits, and intended behavior change. Research on personalized CAs has already addressed different aspects, such as personalized recommendations and anthropomorphic cues. However, detailed information on interaction styles between patients and CAs in the role of medical health care professionals is scant. Such interaction styles play essential roles for patient satisfaction, treatment adherence, and outcome, as has been shown for physician-patient interactions. Currently, it is not clear (1) whether chronically ill patients prefer a CA with a paternalistic, informative, interpretive, or deliberative interaction style, and (2) which factors influence these preferences. Objective: We aimed to investigate the preferences of chronically ill patients for CA-delivered interaction styles. Methods: We conducted two studies. The first study included a paper-based approach and explored the preferences of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients for paternalistic, informative, interpretive, and deliberative CA-delivered interaction styles. Based on these results, a second study assessed the effects of the paternalistic and deliberative interaction styles on the relationship quality between the CA and patients via hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses in an online experiment with COPD patients. Patients' sociodemographic and disease-specific characteristics served as moderator variables. Results: Study 1 with 117 COPD patients revealed a preference for the deliberative (50/117) and informative (34/117) interaction styles across demographic characteristics. All patients who preferred the paternalistic style over the other interaction styles had more severe COPD (three patients, Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease class 3 or 4). In Study 2 with 123 newly recruited COPD patients, younger participants and participants with a less recent COPD diagnosis scored higher on interaction-related outcomes when interacting with a CA that delivered the deliberative interaction style (interaction between age and CA type: relationship quality: b=-0.77, 95% CI -1.37 to -0.18; intention to continue interaction: b=-0.49, 95% CI -0.97 to -0.01; working alliance attachment bond: b=-0.65, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.04; working alliance goal agreement: b=-0.59, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.01; interaction between recency of COPD diagnosis and CA type: working alliance goal agreement: b=0.57, 95% CI 0.01 to 1.13). Conclusions: Our results indicate that age and a patient's personal disease experience inform which CA interaction style the patient should be paired with to achieve increased interaction-related outcomes with the CA. These results allow the design of personalized health care CAs with the goal to increase long-term adherence to health-promoting behavior. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - The Coronavirus disease; COVID-19 vaccines will not end the pandemic if they stay in freezers. In many countries, such as France, COVID-19 vaccines hesitancy is high. It is crucial that governments make it as easy as possible for people who want to be vaccinated to do so, but also that they devise communication strategies to address the concerns of vaccine hesitant individuals.We introduce and test on 701 French participants a novel messaging strategy: A chatbot that answers people’s questions about COVID-19 vaccines. We find that interacting with this chatbot for a few minutes significantly increases people’s intentions to get vaccinated (ß = 0.12) and has a positive impact on their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (ß = 0.23). Our results suggest that a properly scripted and regularly updated chatbot could offer a powerful resource to help fight hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - Travel photos inform and inspire consumers by conveying a first-hand destination experience. Despite the proliferation of consumer-generated travel photos in online travel review sites, deconstructing the effects of photos on consumer engagement remains a challenge to the tourism industry. We provide a framework to process and interpret various photographic elements on user engagement using deep learning algorithms. We posit that a photo can invoke consumers’ subjective interpretations of photos representing authentic, creative, or emotional dimensions of the destination experience. A structured crowdsourced categorization process was deployed to measure the interpretive dimensions of the photos. The objects in photographs are identified using a novel deep learning algorithm for controls. We use narrative framing concepts to theorize their influence on user engagement in an online travel review site setting. Relevant three sets of hypotheses are tested using a large dataset of photo-based travel reviews sampled between 2012 and 2014. A negative zero-inflated binomial regression is used to estimate the effect of subjective interpretation of photos on user engagement, accounting for overdispersed excess zeros associated with count outcomes. Results support the hypotheses. The additional analyses explore other plausible influential attributes to user engagements to complement our main findings. We discuss the theoretical contributions to the online-image-persuasion stream of research and practical implications for online tourist review sites. © 2021, Institute of Applied Informatics at University of Leipzig.

AB  - Artificial intelligence algorithms are ubiquitous in daily life, and this is motivating the development of some institutional initiatives to ensure trustworthiness in Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, there is not enough research on how these algorithms can influence people’s decisions and attitudes. The present research examines whether algorithms can persuade people, explicitly or covertly, on whom to vote and date, or whether, by contrast, people would reject their influence in an attempt to confirm their personal freedom and independence. In four experiments, we found that persuasion was possible and that different styles of persuasion (e.g., explicit, covert) were more effective depending on the decision context (e.g., political and dating). We conclude that it is important to educate people against trusting and following the advice of algorithms blindly. A discussion on who owns and can use the data that makes these algorithms work efficiently is also necessary. Copyright: © 2021 Agudo, Matute.

AB  - In this scoping review, we aimed to summarize and analyze the latest research developments of persuasive design for healthy eating behavior and explore future design opportunities. This paper initially collected 1231 papers from 2011 to 2021 in three different databases: the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) digital library, IEEE Xplore and SpringerLink databases. Based on a selection process, 28 papers that mainly focused on addressing dietary health by persuasive designs were eventually included in final analysis. These 28 papers were sorted by three characteristics: research specifications, methodologies, and design rationales. Our data analyses revealed that the reviewed papers primarily utilized persuasive technologies for eating behaviors monitoring, recording, and healthy eating suggestion. Moreover, six types of design applications were commonly implemented, including mobile applications, persuasive messages, digital products and service systems, wearable devices, chatbots/assistants, and public devices. Our review showed that persuasive design, as a generic approach for promoting healthy eating, lacked research investigations on personalized solutions for particular user groups such as office workers and teenagers. Future works could explore persuasive design strategies by applying the research factors of user experience and examining the efficacy of persuasive technology tools to effectively promote healthy eating behaviors for various user groups in different contexts. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Health risk behaviors are leading contributors to morbidity, premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, and escalating health costs. However, traditional interventions to change health behaviors often have modest effects, and limited applicability and scale. To better support health improvement goals across the care continuum, new approaches incorporating various smart technologies are being utilized to create more individualized digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). The purpose of this study is to identify context-aware DBCIs that provide individualized interventions to improve health. A systematic review of published literature (2013-2020) was conducted from multiple databases and manual searches. All included DBCIs were context-aware, automated digital health technologies, whereby user input, activity, or location influenced the intervention. Included studies addressed explicit health behaviors and reported data of behavior change outcomes. Data extracted from studies included study design, type of intervention, including its functions and technologies used, behavior change techniques, and target health behavior and outcomes data. Thirty-three articles were included, comprising mobile health (mHealth) applications, Internet of Things wearables/sensors, and internet-based web applications. The most frequently adopted behavior change techniques were in the groupings of feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning. Technologies used to apply these in a context-aware, automated fashion included analytic and artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning and symbolic reasoning) methods requiring various degrees of access to data. Studies demonstrated improvements in physical activity, dietary behaviors, medication adherence, and sun protection practices. Context-aware DBCIs effectively supported behavior change to improve users' health behaviors.  © 2020

AB  - This paper studies the control strategy in tilt-rotor aircraft dynamic conversion procedure. A nonlinear flight dynamics model with full flight modes is established. On this basis, a nonlinear optimal control model of dynamic conversion is built by constructing the Bolza form of nonlinear optimal control problem. It contains the limitations and effects of conversion corridor, pilot control, flight attitude, engine rated power, wing stall, and the cooperation between lift and thrust on the procedure of dynamic conversion. An efficient numerical solution method with good convergence is designed to obtain the trajectory and control strategy of dynamic conversion between the modes of helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft. Through the weight parameter analysis, it can be seen that when the subitem of pilot workload is included in the cost function, the displacements of collective stick input as well as the longitudinal stick input are significantly reduced, and the height and pitch attitude change more gently, but the time has been extended. In addition, the pilot workload weight coefficient should not be dominant, otherwise the overly smooth manipulations of collective and longitudinal stick will cause a decrease of height.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and ensuing social restrictions has been profound, affecting the health, livelihoods, and wellbeing of populations worldwide. Studies have shown widespread effects on mental health, with an increase in stress, loneliness, and depression symptoms related to the pandemic. Media plays a critical role in containing and managing crises, by informing society and fostering positive behavior change. Social restrictions have led to a large increase in reliance on online media channels, and this can influence mental health and wellbeing. Anxiety levels, for instance, may be exacerbated by exposure to COVID-related content, contagion of negative sentiment among social networks, and “fake news.” In some cases, this may trigger abstinence, leading to isolation and limited access to vital information. To be able to communicate distressing news during crises while protecting the wellbeing of individuals is not trivial; it requires a deeper understanding of people's emotional response to online and social media content. This paper selectively reviews research into consequences of social media usage and online news consumption for wellbeing and mental health, focusing on and discussing their effects in the context of the pandemic. Advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science, for example, Natural Language Processing, Sentiment Analysis, and Emotion Recognition, are discussed as useful methods for investigating effects on population mental health as the pandemic situation evolves. We present suggestions for future research, and for using these advances to assess large data sets of users' online content, to potentially inform strategies that enhance the mental health of social media users going forward. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Voice assistants are changing the way consumers shop. Guided by the anthropomorphism literature and parasocial interaction theory, this study investigated how the new unique relationship between consumers and artificial intelligence-powered voice assistants may affect the way consumers evaluate the recommended products through two experiments. Study 1 (n = 85, students) employed a 2 (shopping medium type: voice assistant vs. website) × 2 (interaction style: task-oriented vs. socially-oriented) between-subjects design lab experiment. Study 2 (n = 418, Mechanical Turk) employed a 2 (shopping medium type: voice assistant vs. website) × 2 (product type: search vs. experience) between-subjects online experiment. The results suggested that consumers may perceive voice assistants as pseudohuman agents detached from the service provider while perceiving websites as a tool or interface used by the provider, resulting in a more positive perception and evaluation of websites. As one of the few studies investigating voice assistants from the consumer perspective, this study contributes to the growing body of research in voice assistants. The study also contributes to anthropomorphism literature and parasocial interaction theory by confirming the causal relationship between humanlikeness and parasocial relationships. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Introduction: Thanks to improvement of care, cancer has become a chronic condition. But due to the toxicity of treatment, the importance of supporting the quality of life (QoL) of cancer patients increases. Monitoring and managing QoL relies on data collected by the patient in his/her home environment, its integration, and its analysis, which supports personalization of cancer management recommendations. We review the state-of-the-art of computerized systems that employ AI and Data Science methods to monitor the health status and provide support to cancer patients managed at home. Objective: Our main objective is to analyze the literature to identify open research challenges that a novel decision support system for cancer patients and clinicians will need to address, point to potential solutions, and provide a list of established best-practices to adopt. Methods: We designed a review study, in compliance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, analyzing studies retrieved from PubMed related to monitoring cancer patients in their home environments via sensors and self-reporting: what data is collected, what are the techniques used to collect data, semantically integrate it, infer the patient's state from it and deliver coaching/behavior change interventions. Results: Starting from an initial corpus of 819 unique articles, a total of 180 papers were considered in the full-text analysis and 109 were finally included in the review. Our findings are organized and presented in four main sub-topics consisting of data collection, data integration, predictive modeling and patient coaching. Conclusion: Development of modern decision support systems for cancer needs to utilize best practices like the use of validated electronic questionnaires for quality-of-life assessment, adoption of appropriate information modeling standards supplemented by terminologies/ontologies, adherence to FAIR data principles, external validation, stratification of patients in subgroups for better predictive modeling, and adoption of formal behavior change theories. Open research challenges include supporting emotional and social dimensions of well-being, including PROs in predictive modeling, and providing better customization of behavioral interventions for the specific population of cancer patients. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The massive introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) has triggered significant societal concerns, ranging from “technological unemployment” and the dominance of algorithms in the work place and in everyday life, among others. While AI is made by humans and is, therefore, dependent on the latter for its purpose, the increasing capabilities of AI to carry out productive activities for humans can lead the latter to unwitting slavish existence. This has become evident, for example, in the area of social media use, where AI programmers tie psychology and persuasion to the human social need for approval and validation in ways that few users can resist. We argue that AI should serve humans with humans as masters and not the other way around. Moreover, we propose that virtue ethics might play a role to solidify the human as master of AI and guard against the alternative of AI as the master. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Reddit, the fifth most popular website in the United States, boasts a large and engaged user base on its dermatology forums where users crowdsource free medical opinions. Unfortunately, much of the advice provided is unvalidated and could lead to the provision of inappropriate care. Initial testing has revealed that artificially intelligent bots can detect misinformation regarding tanning and essential oils on Reddit dermatology forums and may be able to produce responses to posts containing misinformation. Objective: To analyze the ability of bots to find and respond to tanning and essential oil–related health misinformation on Reddit’s dermatology forums in a controlled test environment. Methods: Using natural language processing techniques, we trained bots to target misinformation, using relevant keywords and to post prefabricated responses. By evaluating different model architectures across a held-out test set, we compared performances. Results: Our models yielded data test accuracies ranging 95%-100%, with a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) fine-tuned model resulting in the highest level of test accuracy. Bots were then able to post corrective prefabricated responses to misinformation in a test environment. Conclusions: Using a limited data set, bots accurately detected examples of health misinformation within Reddit dermatology forums. Given that these bots can then post prefabricated responses, this technique may allow for interception of misinformation. Providing correct information does not mean that users will be receptive or find such interventions persuasive. Further studies should investigate this strategy’s effectiveness to inform future deployment of bots as a technique in combating health misinformation. ©Monique A Sager, Aditya M Kashyap, Mila Tamminga, Sadhana Ravoori, Christopher Callison-Burch, Jules B Lipoff.

AB  - Video target tracking covers a variety of interdisciplinary subjects such as pattern recognition, image processing, computer graphics and artificial intelligence. In recent years, visual tracking research methods have made significant progress, and scholars have proposed many excellent algorithms. Based on this, this paper uses the basic tracking algorithm and block orthogonal matching pursuit (BOMP) algorithm of image reconstruction, respectively, from the run time, the quality of reconstruction, reconstruction error of the two algorithms to do simulation experiments, and compare their performance, the results show that the BOMP algorithm running time is short, has extensive application, therefore, to determine the BOMP algorithm as a sparse representation model is the core of the method. Then establish the target observation model, introduce the sparse display into the particle filter framework, and update the sparse representation coefficients so that the norm reaches the optimal solution and ensure the accuracy of the tracking target. Finally, through the simulation experiment, the success rate of the target coverage is calculated. The results show that the BOMP algorithm can maintain high tracking accuracy and strong stability in the case of appearance changes caused by illumination changes, partial occlusion and attitude changes. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Legal practice can gain much from advances in machine learning and A.I. technology. Common law countries such as the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia, rely on judicial precedent to decide what law governs new cases and how that law is applied. Judicial precedent is the body of case law that observes how past courts have decided similar cases. Case law is composed of individual case decisions by courts that resolve a particular dispute. When resolving new cases, courts look back on judicial precedent to structure how to decide said new cases. Thus, an extensive knowledge base of how prior cases have been decided under what law is needed in each field of legal practice. Legal research is the practice of identifying relevant case law for a particular set of facts and is essential for any practitioner seeking to make the most persuasive argument for clients. Reviewing case law and identifying relevant cases can be time consuming and imperfect; there is always risk that practitioners overlook relevant and/or new case law that has changed the legal landscape of their practice. Thus practitioners are not only required to retain an extensive knowledge base of relevant case law, but also to keep abreast of changes in case law.  © 2021 Owner/Author.

AB  - Persuasion success is often related to hard-to-measure characteristics, such as the way the persuader speaks. To examine how vocal tones impact persuasion in an online appeal, this research measures persuaders' vocal tones in Kickstarter video pitches using novel audio mining technology. Connecting vocal tone dimensions with real-world funding outcomes offers insight into the impact of vocal tones on receivers' actions. The core hypothesis of this paper is that a successful persuasion attempt is associated with vocal tones denoting (1) focus, (2) low stress, and (3) stable emotions. These three vocal tone dimensions - which are in line with the stereotype content model - matter because they allow receivers to make inferences about a persuader's competence. The hypotheses are tested with a large-scale empirical study using Kickstarter data, which is then replicated in a different category. In addition, two controlled experiments provide evidence that perceptions of competence mediate the impact of the three vocal tones on persuasion attempt success. The results identify key indicators of persuasion attempt success and suggest a greater role for audio mining in academic consumer research. © 2021 The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Stress is a prevalent issue amongst patients with chronic conditions. As eHealth interventions are gaining importance, it becomes more relevant to invoke the possibilities from the eHealth technology itself to provide motivational acts during experiences of stress as to enhance adherence to the intervention. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA's) also known as ‘robots on screen’ can potentially provide a remedy. Within our eHealth experiment we applied a between-subjects design and experimentally studied the difference in appraisal of motivation and guidance. We deployed a functionally modest, monologue-style ECA and compared them with textual guidance. This way, we filtered out the considerable positive impact of interactive features that go along with dialogue-style ECA's. The study was carried out amongst eHealth users of which half were deliberately put in a stressful pre-condition. The rationale was two-sided; first, we hypothesized that it would induce a need for motivational support. Second, it would provide a fair representation of eHealth users in real life. Furthermore, we investigated hypothesized positive effects from a gender match between participant and ECA. The results demonstrated preferential ECA effects compared to text but only in the no stress conditions. Although our set-up controlled for user distraction by putting the facilitating ECA in a pane separate from the eHealth environment, we suspect that the enduring visual presence of the ECA during task completion had still inhibited distressed users. Discussing this phenomenon, our stance is that the hypothesis that ECA support is always superior to textual guidance is open for re-evaluation. Text may sometimes serve users equally well because it lacks human-like aspects that in stressful circumstances can become confrontational. We discuss the potential of ECA's to motivate, but also elaborate on the caveats. Further implications for the ECA, intervention adherence, and eHealth study fields are discussed in relation to stress. © 2021 The Author(s); Stress; eHealth; Support; Embodied conversational agent; ECA; Persuasive technology © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: Treatment of malocclusion with clear removable appliances like Invisalign® or Spark™, require considerable higher level of patient compliance when compared to conventional fixed braces. The clinical outcomes and treatment efficiency strongly depend on the patient’s discipline. Smart treatment coaching applications, like strojCHECK® are efficient for improving patient compliance. Purpose: To evaluate the impact of computerized personalized decision algorithms responding to observed and anticipated patient behavior implemented as an update of an existing clinical orthodontic application (app). Materials and Methods: Variables such as (1) patient app interaction, (2) patient app discipline and (3) clinical aligner tracking evaluated by artificial intelligence system (AI) system— Dental monitoring® were observed on the set of 86 patients. Two 60-day periods were evaluated; before and after the app was updated with decision tree processes. Results: All variables showed significant improvement after the update except for the manifestation of clinical non-tracking in men, evaluated by artificial intelligence from video scans. Conclusions: Implementation of application update including computerized decision processes can significantly enhance clinical performance of existing health care applications and improve patients’ compliance. Using the algorithm with decision tree architecture could create a baseline for further machine learning optimization. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Maintaining customer–company relationship is very important from the perspective of business. It helps to gain new customers as well as retain existing customers, even the dissatisfied ones, through SIoT based informal and humble counseling. Full form of SIoT is social internet of things where smart objects communicate via social networks to extract required information and propagate suitable ones to identify potential customers and counsel them online. These objects are equipped with machine intelligence so that they can make friends in social networks, collaborate with each other to achieve a common goal, update relationship status and level of trustworthiness between them. Using social network connectivity different groups can be created, where satisfied and brand sincere customers can support company-engaged smart objects to convince or persuade prospective buyers. Convincing also includes the provision of humble and honest apologizing for poor quality customer service which the concerned person might have experienced earlier from company of the object. This may be difficult for a human being because of his underlying nature or characteristics like ego, anger etc. but becomes extremely easy for smart objects because they are devoid of human emotions and enabled by machine intelligence only. Research has proved that behavioral optimization techniques are capable of significantly improving a company’s sales record. Therefore, we can emphatically say that SIoT can be of great help to increase sales of a company. In this article, we propose: a complete model of communication for SIoT-CRM, design the company object as a finite automaton, mathematical models of persuasion with and without support of brand sincere customers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This experiment (N = 228) examined how exposure to a talking head doppelganger created by an artificial intelligence (AI) program influenced affect-based trust toward AIs. Using a 3 (talking head featuring the participant's or a stranger's face, audio-only condition) by 2 (pro-AI pitch and anti-AI pitch playback) design, we uncovered that exposure to a talking head featuring the participant's face instead of a stranger's face increased uncanny valley perceptions. Furthermore, uncanny valley perceptions mediated the link between exposure to a talking head with the participant's face on affect-based trust. Overall, exposure to a doppelganger talking head, who delivered a persuasive pitch, triggered discomfort on the participant whose features were sourced to craft a synthetic talking head, which in turn decreased affect-based trust attributed to AIs. This phenomenon is rooted in basic psychological mechanisms that underpin the uncanny valley hypothesis. Future studies may test for these findings across different platforms and also provide evidence regarding user mental processing.  © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.

AB  - Intelligent cognitive assistant (ICA) technology is used in various domains to emulate human behavior expressed through synchronous communication, especially written conversation. Due to their ability to use individually tailored natural language, they present a powerful vessel to support attitude and behavior change. Behavior change support systems are emerging as a crucial tool in digital mental health services, and ICAs exceed in effective support, especially for stress, anxiety and depression (SAD), where ICAs guide people’s thought processes and actions by analyzing their affective and cognitive phenomena. Currently, there is no comprehensive review of such ICAs from a technical standpoint, and existing work is conducted exclusively from a psychological or medical perspective. This technical state-of-the-art review tried to discern and systematize current technological approaches and trends as well as detail the highly interdisciplinary landscape of intersections between ICAs, attitude and behavior change, and mental health, focusing on text-based ICAs for SAD. Ten papers with systems, fitting our criteria, were selected. The systems varied significantly in their approaches, with the most successful opting for comprehensive user models, classification-based assessment, personalized intervention, and dialogue tree conversational models. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - All people in the world are entitled to enjoy a clean environment and a good quality of life. With big data and artificial intelligence technologies, it is possible to estimate personalized air pollution exposure and synchronize it with activity, health, quality of life and behavioural data, and provide real-time, personalized and interactive alert and advice to improve the health and well-being of individual citizens. In this paper, we propose an overarching framework outlining five major challenges to personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, and respective methodologies in an integrated interdisciplinary manner. First, urban air quality data is sparse, rendering it difficult to provide timely personalized alert and advice. Second, collected data, especially those involving human inputs such as health perception, are often missing and erroneous. Third, the data collected are heterogeneous, and highly complex, not easily comprehensible to facilitate individual and collective decision-making. Fourth, the causal relationships between personal air pollutants exposure (specifically, PM2.5 and PM1.0 and NO2) and personal health conditions, and health-related quality of life perception, of young asthmatics and young healthy citizens in Hong Kong (HK), are yet to be established. Fifth, whether personalized and smart information and advice provided can induce behavioural change and improve health and quality of life are yet to be determined. To overcome these challenges, our first novelty is to develop an AI and big data framework to estimate and forecast air quality in high temporal-spatial resolution and real-time. Our second novelty includes the deployment of mobile pollution sensor platforms to substantially improve the accuracy of estimated and forecasted air quality data, and the collection of activity, health condition and perception data. Our third novelty is the development of visualization tools and comprehensible indexes, by correlating personal exposure with four types of personal data, to provide timely, personalized pollution, health and travel alerts and advice. Our fourth novelty is determining causal relationship, if any, between personal pollutants, PM1.0 and PM2.5, NO2 exposure and personal health condition, and personal health perception, based on a clinical experiment of 150 young asthmatics and 150 young healthy citizens in HK. Our fifth novelty is an intervention study to determine if smart information, presented via our proposed visualized platform, will induce personal behavioural change. Our novel big data AI-driven approach, when integrated with other analytical approaches, provides an integrated interdisciplinary framework for personalized air pollution monitoring and health management, easily transferrable to and applicable in other domains and countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Digital therapeutics are evidence-based therapeutic interventions driven by high-quality software programs for the treatment, prevention, or management of a medical disorder or disease. Many studies in the western population have shown the effectiveness of mobile app-based digital therapeutics for improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, few studies have assessed similar outcomes in the South Asian population. Objective: This study aims to investigate the real-world effectiveness of the Wellthy CARE digital therapeutic for improving glycemic control among the South Asian population of Indian origin. Methods: We analyzed deidentified data from 102 patients with T2D from India enrolled in a 16-week structured self-management program delivered using the Wellthy CARE mobile app. Patients recorded their meals, weight, physical activity, and blood sugar in the app, and they received lessons on self-care behaviors (healthy eating, being active, monitoring, medication adherence, problem solving, healthy coping, and reducing risks); feedback provided by an artificial intelligence-powered chatbot; and periodic interactions with certified diabetes educators via voice calls and chats. The primary outcome of the program was a change in glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). Secondary outcomes included the difference between preintervention and postintervention fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels; changes in BMI and weight at the completion of 16 weeks; and the association between program engagement and the changes in HbA1c, FBG, and PPBG levels. Results: At the end of 16 weeks, the average change in HbA1c was -0.49% (n=102; 95% CI -0.73 to 0.25; P<.001). Of all the patients, 63.7% (65/102) had improved HbA1c levels, with a mean change of -1.16% (n=65; 95% CI -1.40 to -0.92; P<.001). The mean preintervention and postintervention FBG levels were 145 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 135-155) and 134 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 122-146; P=.02) and PPBG levels were 188 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 172-203) and 166 mg/dL (n=51; 95% CI 153-180; P=.03), respectively. The mean changes in BMI and weight were -0.47 kg/m2 (n=59; 95% CI -0.22 to -0.71; P<.001) and -1.32 kg (n=59; 95% CI -0.63 to -2.01; P<.001), respectively. There was a stepwise decrease in HbA1c, FBG, and PPBG levels as the program engagement increased. Patients in the highest tertile of program engagement had a significantly higher reduction in HbA1c (-0.84% vs -0.06%; P=.02), FBG (-21.4 mg/dL vs -0.18 mg/dL; P=.02), and PPBG levels (-22.03 mg/dL vs 2.35 mg/dL; P=.002) than those in the lowest tertile. Conclusions: The use of the Wellthy CARE digital therapeutic for patients with T2D showed a significant reduction in the levels of HbA1c, FBG, and PPBG after 16 weeks. A higher level of participation showed improved glycemic control, suggesting the potential of the Wellthy CARE platform for better management of the disease. © 2021 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Background: Less than 2% of overweight children and adolescents in Switzerland can participate in multi-component behaviour changing interventions (BCI), due to costs and lack of time. Stress often hinders positive health outcomes in youth with obesity. Digital health interventions, with fewer on-site visits, promise health care access in remote regions; however, evidence for their effectiveness is scarce. Methods: This randomized controlled not blinded trial (1:1) was conducted in a childhood obesity center in Switzerland. Forty-one youth aged 10–18 years with body mass index (BMI) > P.90 with risk factors or co-morbidities or BMI > P.97 were recruited. During 5.5 months, the PathMate2 group (PM) received daily conversational agent counselling via mobile app, combined with standardized counselling (4 on-site visits). Controls (CON) participated in a BCI (7 on-site visits). We compared the outcomes of both groups after 5.5 (T1) and 12 (T2) months. Primary outcome was reduction in BMI-SDS (BMI standard deviation score: BMI adjusted for age and sex). Secondary outcomes were changes in body fat and muscle mass (bioelectrical impedance analysis), waist-to-height ratio, physical capacities (modified Dordel-Koch-Test), blood pressure and pulse. Additionally, we hypothesized that less stressed children would lose more weight. Thus, children performed biofeedback relaxation exercises while stress parameters (plasma cortisol, stress questionnaires) were evaluated. Results: At intervention start median BMI-SDS of all patients (18 PM, 13 CON) was 2.61 (obesity > + 2SD). BMI-SDS decreased significantly in CON at T1, but not at T2, and did not decrease in PM during the study. Muscle mass, strength and agility improved significantly in both groups at T2; only PM reduced significantly their body fat at T1 and T2. Average daily PM app usage rate was 71.5%. Cortisol serum levels decreased significantly after biofeedback but with no association between stress parameters and BMI-SDS. No side effects were observed. Conclusions: Equally to BCI, PathMate2 intervention resulted in significant and lasting improvements of physical capacities and body composition, but not in sustained BMI-SDS decrease. This youth-appealing mobile health intervention provides an interesting approach for youth with obesity who have limited access to health care. Biofeedback reduces acute stress and could be an innovative adjunct to usual care. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has spread over 219 countries of the globe as a pandemic, creating alarming impacts on health care, socioeconomic environments, and international relationships. The principal objective of the study is to provide the current technological aspects of artificial intelligence (AI) and other relevant technologies and their implications for confronting COVID-19 and preventing the pandemic’s dreadful effects. This article presents AI approaches that have significant contributions in the fields of health care, then highlights and categorizes their applications in confronting COVID-19, such as detection and diagnosis, data analysis and treatment procedures, research and drug development, social control and services, and the prediction of outbreaks. The study addresses the link between the technologies and the epidemics as well as the potential impacts of technology in health care with the introduction of machine learning and natural language processing tools. It is expected that this comprehensive study will support researchers in modeling health care systems and drive further studies in advanced technologies. Finally, we propose future directions in research and conclude that persuasive AI strategies, probabilistic models, and supervised learning are required to tackle future pandemic challenges. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Nowadays, there are more and more legal and ethical limitations when it comes to managing personal data. This is a serious problem for recommender systems (RS) or similar aplications since personal data (e.g. socioeconomic, demographics, behavioural, etc.) are the most useful for generating tailored correlations and predictions. To cope with this issue, this work proposes a recommender system that safeguards the user privacy by using a Federated Learning approach (FL). To this end, this article takes as the baseline an already existing centralized RS that uses all the data from users in a clear manner. This baseline RS is based on Factor Machines and it aims to employ persuasion strategies adapted to the user to increase energy awareness and change their consumption habits in the work environment. In order to test the performance of the FL-based distributed RS, the real dataset used (N=678) have been separated into four subsets mimicking a segmentation by country of origin (Austria, UK, Spain and Greece). Each country can create an artificial intelligence model suitable for its users that will be sent to a central server where the aggregation of models will take place and the improved global model will be returned back to each country. The simulation of this FL strategy is performed with four Raspberry Pi's reflecting each country and an NVIDIA Jetson Nano is used as the aggregation server. The generated model not only increases the privacy of the users as no raw data travels to the central server but also improves the reliability of the recommendations. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.

AB  - Research interest in gamification is currently enjoying global attention. However, while game design is often the focus of these gamification systems, interface design is overlooked. This is due to the expectations of field stakeholders and experts who consider interface to be only a minor element of the gamification experience. The aim of this paper is to propose a classification method that categorizes the gamification element into tangible and intangible. This new classification would provide a clear perspective about the elements before the design and development of an educational game has even begun. The proposed new method of classification would save researcher's time and effort by assisting in the selection of the most appropriate gamification elements for the situation at hand. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Sufficient physical activity can prolong the ability of older adults to live independently. Community-based exercise programs can be enhanced by regularly performing exercises at home. To support such a home-based exercise program, a blended intervention was developed that combined the use of a tablet application with a personal coach. The purpose of the current study was to explore to which extent tablet engagement predicted exercise adherence and physical activity. The results show that older adults (n = 133; M = 71 years of age) that participated 6 months in a randomized controlled trial, performed at average 12 home-based exercised per week and exercised on average 3 days per week, thereby meeting WHO guidelines. They used the tablet app on average 7 times per week. Multiple linear regressions revealed that the use of the app predicted the number of exercises that were performed and the number of exercise days. We conclude that engagement with a tablet can contribute to sustained exercise behavior. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Gait planning parameters are important for quadruped robots to walk stably. In this paper, application of inverted pendulum model is widdened and a new collision model of quadruped trotting between feet and the ground that can indicate body-attitude changes in walking is established. Influences of initial foot position, walking cyclic period and stride length on walking stability are discussed. The influence varies with different initial foot positons and we get the optimal initial foot position for the quadruped in trot gait with minimum variation in body attitude and maximum walking stability. Finally, we get the optimal initial foot position and walking cyclic period with minimal collision velocity. Simulation results are presented. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Normalization operations are essential for state-of-the-art neural networks and enable us to train a network from scratch with a large learning rate (LR). We attempt to explain the real effect of Batch Normalization (BN) from the perspective of variance transmission by investigating the relationship between BN and Weights Normalization (WN). In this work, we demonstrate that the problem of the shift of the average gradient will amplify the variance of every convolutional (conv) layer. We propose Parametric Weights Standardization (PWS), a fast and robust to mini-batch size module used for conv filters, to solve the shift of the average gradient. PWS can provide the speed-up of BN. Besides, it has less computation and does not change the output of a conv layer. PWS enables the network to converge fast without normalizing the outputs. This result enhances the persuasiveness of the shift of the average gradient and explains why BN works from the perspective of variance transmission.

AB  - Gerontechnology based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is expected to fulfill the promise of the so-called 4p-medicine and enable a predictive, personalized, preventive, and participatory elderly care. Although empirical evidence shows positive health outcomes, commentators are concerned that AI-based gerontechnology could bring along the disruption of elderly care. A systematic conceptualization of these concerns is lacking. In this paper, such a conceptualization is suggested by analyzing the risks of AI in elderly care as “4d-risks”: the depersonalization of care through algorithm-based standardization, the discrimination of minority groups through generalization, the dehumanization of the care relationship through automatization, and the disciplination of users through monitoring and surveillance. Based on the 4d-model, strategies for a patient-centered AI in elderly care are outlined. Whether AI-based gerontechnology will actualize the 4p-perspective or bring about the 4d-scenario depends on whether joint efforts of users, caregivers, care providers, engineers, and policy makers will be made. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Preconception care is important for all women to improve infant and maternal health outcomes and may be especially important for adolescents and young adults. This study assesses the acceptance, usability, and use of an automated intervention to screen women on 108 preconception care risks and address them over the course of a year via a Web-based virtual animated health counselor and compares these measures for the adolescent and young adult users aged 18–25 years with those of users aged 26–34 years. We hypothesize that the younger cohort will have significantly greater use of and satisfaction with the online intervention. Methods: A randomized controlled trial involving a national sample of 528 women was conducted. We present a secondary data analysis on the system use and self-reported usability and satisfaction of the 79 women aged 18–25 years randomized to the intervention group, compared with the 183 women aged 26–34 years in the intervention group. Participants were required to self-identify as female, black or African American, aged 18–34 years, not pregnant, and English-speaking and were recruited through a variety of advertisements and outreach activities. Results: Of the adolescent and young adult participants (aged 18–25 years) enrolled and randomized to the intervention, 20.25% of participants accessed the system 0 times; 29.11%, 1–3 times; and 50.63%, >3 times over the course of a year. At the end of the year, almost all (96.4%) indicated they had either acted on recommendations made by the agent or planned to. Most (75.0%) said they would recommend the system to someone they knew. There were no significant differences between the two age groups on intervention use or satisfaction. Conclusions: Web-based conversational agents are a viable medium for delivering longitudinal preconception care counseling to adolescents and young adults. © 2019

AB  - Background: The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption. Objective: This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents. Methods: PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another. Results: A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback. Conclusions: The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents. ©Madison Milne-Ives, Caroline de Cock, Ernest Lim, Melissa Harper Shehadeh, Nick de Pennington, Guy Mole, Eduardo Normando, Edward Meinert.

AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has greatly impacted medical services worldwide. In addition to changing the processes used by hospital medical services, it has also changed the behaviors of medical staff, resulting in a completely different appearance. Fear of being infected with COVID-19 makes patients fear entering hospitals, and hospitals must repeatedly screen patients prior to entry in order to confirm that they are not infected. Patients are then separated according to their symptoms and travel, occupation, contact and cluster histories (TOCC), which seriously affects them. In addition, hospitals have invested a lot of money into the whole visiting process and into the equipment required to prevent the spread or lessen the impact of COVID-19. © 2020

AB  - Chronic diseases are a growing concern in public health. Lack of adherence to medications and health care interventions is a major factor behind the worsening of chronic disease outcomes and large medical costs. As a result, there is a critical need to identify structural, systematic, and patient-centric barriers to adherence. Similarly important is the development of models and deployable strategies to ensure effective delivery of care so that clinical and economic outcomes are optimized. This commentary review explores the research on nonadherence of patients with chronic diseases and other non-acute conditions to medications and interventions from different disciplinary perspectives, including medicine/pharmacy, pharmacoeconomics, behavioral economics, operations research (OR), and data analytics (DA). Although a spate of works has been conducted in the medicine and pharmacy fields, the contribution of OR/DA to medication/intervention nonadherence is limited. Given the technological advancement and the increasing understanding of nonadherence, we believe that OR/DA can play an essential role in encapsulating the domain knowledge and catalyzing the development of patient-centric solutions. We discuss the challenges and opportunities presented to OR/DA researchers and conclude the commentary with a discussion on new interdisciplinary research directions that can contribute to solving the nonadherence puzzle. © 2021 “IISE”.

AB  - This paper presents a virtual coach for older adults at home to support active and healthy aging, and independent living. It aids users in their behavior change process for improving on cognitive, physical, social interaction and nutrition areas using SMART goals. To achieve an effective behavior change of the user, the coach relies on the I-Change behavioral change model. Using a combination of projectors, cameras, microphones and support sensors, the older adult's home becomes an augmented reality environment, where common objects are used for projection and sensed. Older adults interact with this virtual coach in their home in a natural way using speech and body gestures (including touch in certain objects). © 2020 Owner/Author.

AB  - Future emerging communication technologies are anticipated to fold into our surroundings, helping us get our noses off the smartphone screens and back into our environments. In doing so, they make us more (rather than less) present in the world around us. While 5G was supposed to be about the Internet of Everything, to be transformative 6G might be just about the opposite of Everything, that is, Nothing or, more technically, No Things. Building on the invisible-to-visible technology concept, this article explores how the full potential of multisensory extended reality (XR) experiences may be unleashed in Multiverse cross-reality environments. We exploit the convergence of artificial-intelligence-enhanced multi-access edge computing, intelligent mobile robots, and blockchain technologies to help realize the Internet of No Things as an important stepping stone toward ushering in the 6G post-smartphone era. In our experiments, we consider locally connected human-avatar/robot collectives and investigate our proposed extrasensory perception network, which integrates the three evolutionary mobile computing stages of ubiquitous, pervasive, and persuasive computing. As an illustrative example of advanced XR experiences, we study the delivery of sixth-sense perceptions that transverse the boundary between Multiverse realms in order to mimic the quantum realm. © 1979-2012 IEEE.

AB  - This paper addresses how impairments in prediction in young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) relate to their behavior during collaboration. To assess it, we developed a task where participants play in collaboration with a synthetic agent to maximize their score. The agent’s behavior changes during the different phases of the game, requiring participants to model the agent’s sensorimotor contingencies to play collaboratively. Our results (n = 30, 15 per group) show differences between autistic and neurotypical individuals in their behavioral adaptation to the other partner. Contrarily, there are no differences in the self-reports of that collaboration. © Copyright © 2020 Blancas, Maffei, Sánchez-Fibla, Vouloutsi and Verschure.

AB  - The Internet has been identified in human enhancement scholarship as a powerful cognitive enhancement technology. It offers instant access to almost any type of information, along with the ability to share that information with others. The aim of this paper is to critically assess the enhancement potential of the Internet. We argue that unconditional access to information does not lead to cognitive enhancement. The Internet is not a simple, uniform technology, either in its composition, or in its use. We will look into why the Internet as an informational resource currently fails to enhance cognition. We analyze some of the phenomena that emerge from vast, continual fluxes of information–information overload, misinformation and persuasive design—and show how they could negatively impact users’ cognition. Methods for mitigating these negative impacts are then advanced: individual empowerment, better collaborative systems for sorting and categorizing information, and the use of artificial intelligence assistants that could guide users through the informational space of today’s Internet. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper we provide an account of the burden of persuasion, in the context of structured argumentation. First, burdens of proof in legal proceedings are discussed in general, distinguishing the burdens of production and the burdens of persuasion. Then, we focus on burdens of persuasion, illustrating their role in civil and criminal law. A formal model for the burden of persuasion is then defined, discussed, and used to capture the role of the burden of persuasion in adjudicating conflicts between conflicting arguments and in determining the dialectical status of arguments. We consider how our model can also capture adversarial burdens of proof, namely, those cases in which failure to establish an argument for a proposition burdened with persuasion entails establishing the complementary proposition. Finally, we examine how burdens of proofs can be integrated with standards of proof defining the extent to which an argument for a proposition burdened with persuasion has to be stronger than arguments to the contrary, in order to meet the burden. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Group fairness means that different groups have an equal probability of being predicted for one aspect. It is a significant fairness definition, which is conducive to maintaining social harmony and stability. Fairness is a vital issue when an artificial intelligence software system is used to make judicial decisions. Either data or algorithm alone may lead to unfair results. Determining the fairness of the dataset is a prerequisite for studying the fairness of algorithms. This paper focuses on the dataset to research group fairness from both micro and macro views. We propose a framework to determine the sensitive attributes of a dataset and metrics to measure the fair degree of sensitive attributes. We conducted experiments and statistical analysis of the judicial data to demonstrate the framework and metric approach better. The framework and metric approach can be applied to datasets of other domains, providing persuasive evidence for the effectiveness and availability of algorithmic fairness research. It opens up a new way for the research of the fairness of the dataset. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Bleeding on brushing (BoB) is an important sign of gingival inflammation. Recently, the use of intelligent toothbrushes and oral health Apps has shown potential to improve oral and periodontal health. In the context of the introduction of an Internet of things network of intelligent power-driven toothbrushes in a supportive periodontal care programme, the aim of this study was (a) to audit the adoption and retention of this new technology; and (b) to preliminarily assess the feasibility to gather data on BoB and associate them with clinical periodontal parameters. Methods: 100 subjects with different periodontal case diagnoses participating in supportive periodontal care (SPC) were provided with and instructed on the use of an intelligent power-driven toothbrush connected with an App (I-Brush). Brushing sessions and occurrence of BoB were recorded through the App and stored in a data protection compliant backend. Subject retention was audited over time. BoB recorded in the two weeks before the SPC appointment was associated with clinical parameters observed by the clinician blind to App data. Results: 75% of subjects provided data from using the power toothbrush and the App for a minimum of 10 brushing sessions over an average period of 362 days. Compared with baseline, subjects’ oral hygiene, bleeding on probing and prevalence of residual pockets improved gradually while using the I-Brush. The number of BoB episodes in the two weeks leading to the SPC appointment and the number of residual pockets predicted BOP (p '.001) detected during the examination. App use in the previous two weeks was associated with lower plaque scores at SPC. Conclusions: These preliminary observations indicate good adoption and retention of a mobile health system built around an intelligent power toothbrush in a SPC population. The App was able to gather clinically relevant information predicting the observed degree of gingival inflammation. Deployment of mHealth systems seems feasible in dental practice and may bring significant oral health benefits. More investigations are needed in this area. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Inappropriate lane following and changing behaviors of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) can result in accidents, such as rear-end collision and side collision. To remedy that, the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for autonomous driving decisions is currently a widely used promising solution. In this case, the accuracy and effectiveness of such a machine learning (ML) model is quite essential for this artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled CAVs. This article proposes a blockchain-based collective learning (BCL) framework for autonomous lane-changing systems. Four key issues, namely, learning efficiency, data security, users' privacy, as well as communication burden, are addressed by applying collective learning, vehicular blockchain, and knowledge transfer. First, we model the lane-changing problem as a DRL process and learn the autonomous lane-changing strategy through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Second, a single CAV involves a limited number of driving scenarios, and the independent learning method has the problem of inefficiency. Therefore, we propose a collective learning framework to utilize the 'collective intelligence' shared by CAVs. Third, a vehicular blockchain is then applied to ensure the security and privacy of the user and data. In addition, the introduction of the blockchain can incentivize more users to participate in collective learning. Finally, in order to accelerate the learning process and achieve higher level performance while further reducing the communication burden, we use the corresponding knowledge extracted from the ML model such as human learning, as privileged information for sharing instead of directly sharing local ML models. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposal in terms of learning efficiency, driving safety, as well as system security and robustness. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - With the development of artificial intelligence technologies, the high accuracy of machine learning methods has become a non-unique standard. People are beginning to be more concerned about the understandability between humans and machines. The interference procedure of the machines is hoped to accord with human thinking as much as possible, which has spawned the recent and ongoing demands for developing explainable models. The present study proposes a new explainable and persuasive model for machine learning problems by introducing Structural Equation Modelling into the picture. Six parts make up the model, from data collection to model evaluation. The model can be used for data analysis, machine learning, and causal analysis. The proposed model is also transparent and can be interpreted from design to application. A practical experiment shows its effectiveness in a healthcare problem. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The majority of music recommendation systems use user data such as ratings, likes, feedback, music played as the user model. This is certainly not suitable for new users and users who are new to music. In addition, most of the research related to music recommendation systems focuses on accuracy and pays less attention to user experience. This can be overcome by using an explanation facility which is the reason the system provides recommendations. Explanation facility is able to improve user experience in several factors such as Transparency, Scrutability, Trustworthiness, Effectiveness, Persuasiveness, Efficiency, and Satisfaction. Therefore, in this study, we develop a conversational recommender system with an explanation facility in the music domain. This system works by conducting a conversation between the system and the user, by a chatbot. This system is a knowledge-based recommender system and uses an ontology that serves as a knowledge base for recommending music. We evaluate the system based on two parameters, such as recommendation accuracy and also the influence of explanation for user satisfaction. Tests show that a system with an explanation facility increases user experience more than a system without an explanation facility. In addition, system testing also shows high accuracy (90.48%) and successfully meets user needs.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Gamification has gained scientific attention as a motivational tool for behavior change in various contexts. When designing gamification, several scholars emphasize the importance of tailoring content to the needs of different users, e.g. by using the gamification user types HEXAD typology. From a theoretical point of view, researchers suggest correlations between HEXAD types and certain game elements, but empirical validation of these assumptions is still lacking. Previous studies show limitations either in terms of sample size or comprehensiveness of analysis. Therefore, this study aims to empirically identify game element preferences of different HEXAD types and to validate both the English and a corresponding German version of the HEXAD scale in a quantitative study design with 1,073 participants. The validation shows that the HEXAD scale is a valuable tool for identifying HEXAD types, with some improvements needed for a better model fit. Correlation analysis shows highly significant correlations between HEXAD types and specific game elements. While Philanthropists are motivated by gifting, administrative roles, and knowledge sharing, Free Spirits prefer creativity tools, exploratory tasks, and learning. Both Achievers and Players like challenges, leaderboards, levels, and competition, but Players are additionally attracted by extrinsic elements such as achievements, points, and rewards. Socializers like social elements, i.e., teams, social discovery, and social networks. Finally, Disruptors like anarchic gameplay and innovation platforms. In general, the results suggest that the HEXAD typology provides helpful and validated guidance for tailored gamification, and our findings should successfully drive future gamification design to maximize the desired behavioral outcome. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Research on the psychology of humor indicates that humor can increase the impact of persuasive messages in certain circumstances, suggesting that virtual agents could use humor to improve the effectiveness of motivational counseling with users. To explore this idea, we developed two virtual agents that attempt to motivate users to perform healthy behaviors-either to increase exercise or fruit and vegetable consumption-and systematically vary whether they use humor or not in their counseling conversations. Human-authored jokes were selected from a large corpus based on the nature of the humor (empathetic affiliative humor that serves to build relational closeness), health topic relevance, and subjective ratings of funniness, as well as relevance to user stage of behavior change. We evaluated our agents in a two-treatment counterbalanced within-subjects experiment, where participants interacted with a humorous and non-humorous agent motivating either exercise or healthy diet. We found the interaction with the humorous agent led to a significantly greater change in motivation to engage in the target behavior than interacting with the non-humorous agent. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - To be really effective, conversational agents must integrate well with the characteristics of the humans with whom they interact. This exploratory study focuses on a method for integrating well-assessed methods from the field of social psychology in the design of task-oriented conversational agents in which the dialogue management module is developed through machine learning. In particular, the aim is to achieve agents whose policies could take into account the psychological features of the human interactants to deliver personalized and more effective messages. The paper presents the psychological study performed and outlines the overall theoretical architecture of the software framework proposed. On the psychosocial side, we first assessed the effectiveness of differently framed messages aimed to reducing red meat consumption taking the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as the psychosocial model of reference. Turning to the machine learning field, the resulting Structural Equation Model (SEM) was first translated into a probabilistic predictor using Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN). In turn, such DBN became the fundamental element of a Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDP) in a reinforcement learning setting. The possibility to elicit complete interaction policies was then studied by applying Neural Monte Carlo Tree Search (Neural MCTS) methods. The results thus obtained introduce the possibility to develop new multidisciplinary and integrated techniques for the development of automated dialogue managing systems. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In the last decades, the Natural Language Generation (NLG) methods have been improved to generate text automatically. However, based on the literature review, there are not works on generating text for persuading people. In this paper, we propose to use the SentiGAN framework to generate messages that are classified into levels of persuasiveness. And, we run an experiment using the Microtext dataset for the training phase. Our preliminary results show 0.78 of novelty on average, and 0.57 of diversity in the generated messages. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We model persuasion, viewed as a deliberate action through which an agent (persuader) changes the beliefs of another agent’s (persuadee). This notion of persuasion paves the way to express the idea of persuasive influence, namely inducing a change in the choices of the persuadee by changing her beliefs. It allows in turns to express different aspects of deception. To this end, we propose a logical framework that enables expressing actions and capabilities of agents, their mental states (desires, knowledge and beliefs), a variety of agency operators as well as the connection between mental states and choices. Those notions, once combined, enable us to capture, the notion of influence, persuasion and deception, as well as their relation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Daily, vehicles overload the road networks. Starting from this worldwide issue, we can see the necessity of finding solutions for travel times improvements. Many solutions arise if we look at the lowest possible level in traffic modeling. At the microscopic level, we can have the best overview of the vehicle's interactions, about their velocity, acceleration or lane change behavior. This paper proposes a new approach of lane choice prediction using an AI (Artificial Intelligence) based gaming strategy. Having a piece of road with the lane change action modeled as Markovian process, for a chosen vehicle, this paper aims to find the best decision considering the desired destination and the involved costs. The lane change action will be described as a game where is involved the vehicle that initiates the action, together with parameters as traffic destination volumes, intermediary traffic volumes associated with distinct lanes and the placement of lanes splitting points. The comparison with the Dijkstra's algorithm, known as the optimal for route choice problem solving, proves the efficiency of the proposed approach. The similar results obtained as destination volumes by comparing with the mentioned optimal algorithm consists of a validation step in this paper proposal. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - We study the problem of information design in human-in-theloop systems, where the sender (the system) aims to design an information disclosure policy to influence the receiver (the user) in making decisions. This problem is ubiquitous in systems with humans in the loop, e.g., recommendation systems might choose whether to present others’ reviews to encourage users to follow recommendations, online retailers might choose which set of product features to present to persuade buyers to make the purchase. Among the flourish literature on information design, Bayesian persuasion has been one of the most prominent efforts in formalizing this problem and has spurred various research studies in both economics and computer science. While there has been significant progress in characterizing the optimal information disclosure policies and the corresponding computational complexity, one common assumption in this line of research is that the receiver is Bayesian rational, i.e., the receiver processes the information in a Bayesian manner and takes actions to maximize her expected utility. However, as empirically observed in the literature, this assumption might not be true in real-world scenarios. In this work, we relax this common Bayesian rational assumption in information design in the persuasion setting. In particular, we develop an alternative framework for information design based on discrete choice model and probability weighting to account for this relaxation. Moreover, we conduct online behavioral experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk and demonstrate that our framework better explains real world user behavior and leads to more effective information design policy. © 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - The aim of this study was to test how two important types of social cues used by virtual assistants today can affect consumer concerns and persuasion. These two cues are modality (voice-based via smart speaker, voice-based via a smartphone, or text-based on a smartphone screen) and the adoption of a human name rather than no name. An online scenario-based experiment (n = 180) has shown that participants who were exposed to a voice-based recommendation via a smart speaker were the most concerned about security and found text-based recommendations on a screen to be the most persuasive. Participants who were exposed to a virtual assistant with a human name were less concerned about their autonomy and were more strongly persuaded than those exposed to an assistant without a human name. © 2020 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.

AB  - Background: A large proportion of apprentices shows addictive behaviours like cigarette smoking, alcohol, cannabis, or compulsive Internet use, others do not show such behaviours at all. ready4life is a smartphone application-based coaching program for apprentices, which takes into account the heterogeneity of adolescent addictive behaviour by promoting life skills and reducing risk behaviours. The main objective of the planned study is to test the efficacy of ready4life for addiction prevention among apprentices in Switzerland within a controlled trial. Methods/design: The efficacy of the ready4life coaching program will be tested in comparison to an assessment only control group, within a cluster-randomised controlled trial with one follow-up assessment after 6 months. At the beginning of the program, participants of the intervention group will receive an individual profile, showing areas in which they have sufficient resources and in which there is a need for coaching. Based on this feedback, they can select two out of the following six program modules: stress, social skills, Internet use, tobacco/e-cigarettes, cannabis, and alcohol. Participants of the intervention group will receive individualised coaching by a conversational agent (chatbot) for a period of four months. The coaching relies on motivational and social-cognitive principles of behaviour change. Within weekly dialogues, the coach provides individually tailored information in different formats, such as videoclips, texts, or pictures. Study participants will be 1318 apprentices with a minimum age of 15, recruited in approximately 100 vocational school classes in Switzerland. Primary outcome will be a composite measure for addictive behaviours including (1) at risk-drinking, (2) tobacco/e-cigarette smoking, (3) cannabis use, and (4) problematic Internet use. Discussion: The study will reveal whether this universally implementable but individually tailored intervention approach is effective in preventing the onset and escalation of addictive behaviors among apprentices.

AB  - Persuasive technology is an established field of research that is applied in various domains. However, creative situations, collaborative, or knowledge-intensive processes are still underrepresented. Numerous established approaches exist for the design of persuasive technology. For this purpose, first applications for inspiration cards are already described in the literature. These serve as a source of inspiration in workshops and facilitate the communication between participants and designers. In this study, inspiration cards were used to facilitate the design of persuasive technology to improve creative situations. Applying a design science research approach, this study developed inspiration cards and a canvas. This artifact consists of 17 technology cards, 49 application cards, nine potentials cards and a canvas to structure the design process. The artifact was evaluated in a workshop in which a persuasive technology to support creative behavior in a creative situation was developed by the participants. The results advance the concept of inspiration cards for the design of persuasive technology, provides tools to better analyze a specific application context, that is, a creative situation, and may help promote the use of persuasive technology in an underrepresented field. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Politeness behaviors could affect individuals' decisions heavily in their daily lives and may therefore also play an important role in human-agent interactions. This study considers the impact of politeness behaviors made by a virtual agent, already in a small face-to-face conversational group with another agent, on a human participant as they approach to join it in a virtual environment displayed on a monitor. The agent uses five verbal and nonverbal politeness strategies, ranging from indirect and implicit to direct and explicit, in an attempt to influence the participant to join the group at an inconvenient location, which requires more time and effort than a direct route that would ignore the invitation of the agent. In addition to assessing the success of the strategies at influencing participant behavior, the participants' perception of the agent's persuasive behavior is assessed in relation to clarity, face loss, positive face, and negative face. Based on results from a within-subjects experiment with 30 participants, we found that more direct and explicit politeness strategies have a higher level of success when requesting a participant to join a small group at an inconvenient location, but sometimes negatively impact their perception of the agent. A positive politeness strategy was found to be the most effective for both persuasive success and maintaining a positive impression of the agent. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - In this paper, we explore how the development and affordances of predictive analytics may impact how teachers and other educational actors think about and teach students and, more broadly, how society understands education. Our particular focus is on the data dashboards of learning support systems which are based on Machine Learning (ML). While previous research has focused on how these systems produce credible knowledge, we explore here how they also produce compelling, persuasive and convincing narratives. Our main argument is that particular kinds of stories are written by predictive analytics and written into their data dashboards. Based on a case study of a leading predictive analytics system, we explore how data dashboards imply causality between the ‘facts’ they are visualising. To do so, we analyse the stories they tell according to their spatial and temporal dimensions, characters and events, sequentiality as well as tellability. In the stories we identify, teachers are managers, students are at greater or lesser risk, and students’ sociality is reduced to machine-readable interactions. Overall, only data marked as individual behaviours becomes relevant to the system, rendering structural inequalities invisible. Reflecting on the implications of these systems, we suggest ways in which the uptake of these systems can interrupt such stories and reshape them in other directions. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Intelligent services provide the power of AI to developers via simple RESTful API endpoints, abstracting away many complexities of machine learning. However, most of these intelligent services - -such as computer vision - -continually learn with time. When the internals within the abstracted 'black box' become hidden and evolve, pitfalls emerge in the robustness of applications that depend on these evolving services. Without adapting the way developers plan and construct projects reliant on intelligent services, significant gaps and risks result in both project planning and development. Therefore, how can software engineers best mitigate software evolution risk moving forward, thereby ensuring that their own applications maintain quality? Our proposal is an architectural tactic designed to improve intelligent service-dependent software robustness. The tactic involves creating an application-specific benchmark dataset baselined against an intelligent service, enabling evolutionary behaviour changes to be mitigated. A technical evaluation of our implementation of this architecture demonstrates how the tactic can identify 1,054 cases of substantial confidence evolution and 2,461 cases of substantial changes to response label sets using a dataset consisting of 331 images that evolve when sent to a service. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Persuasion is an active research topic in artificial intelligence (AI), human-computer interaction (HCI), and social sciences. When persuasive technology has been designed, some HCI guidelines have commonly used disregarding the current AI state of the art, for example, ignoring autonomy and proactive AI behavior. In this paper, a systematic review of HCI persuasive strategies and their corresponding content is mapped to a formal AI approach using argumentation theory.

AB  - Much of the research in the field of virtual coaching agents focuses on interactions between a single agent and the user of the application. Another approach could be to give each user a personal virtual coaching team. This makes it possible to present multiple perspectives, and to have coaches with different expertise debate with each other. This could make the content presented more engaging and the system more persuasive. However, currently guidelines and theory to base designs for content for virtual coaching teams on is scarce. In this paper we present a study in which we set out to design content for a virtual coaching team to talk about general health topics with older adults. We based the content for our study on our implementation of two different models from social psychology used to classify interactive behaviour: the Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) and Interpersonal Circumplex (IPC) models. After testing our implementation of the models with a pilot test, we conducted an online study with 242 older adult participants. We compared the content modelled using the IPA model to the content modelled using the IPC model. For the IPA modelled content compared to the IPC modelled content the virtual coaching team came across more positively, the quality of their coaching was perceived to be better, the interaction experience was rated as better, their ability to persuade was better, and their group cohesion (task and social cohesion) was perceived to be better. We conclude that the IPA model is preferred over the IPC model when designing health coaching content for virtual coaching teams, and discuss possible reasons why. Furthermore, we recommend designers of health coaching content to test other models to base content designs on, and to measure the impact of differently modelled content in both more and less sophisticated coaching systems. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: Preconception care focuses on improving women's health before pregnancy as a means to improve their health and future pregnancy outcomes. How to effectively deliver such care is unknown. The aim of this research was to assess the impact of an embodied conversational agent system on preconception risks among African American and Black women. Methods: We did an open-label, randomised controlled trial of women aged 18–34 years, self-identified as African American or Black, or both, and not pregnant, recruited from 35 states in the USA. Sealed allocation envelopes (in permuted blocks of six and eight, prepared using a random number generator) were opened after enrolment. Intervention participants received an online conversational agent called Gabby that assessed 102 preconception risks and delivered 12 months of tailored dialogue using synthesised speech, non-verbal behaviour, visual aids, and health behaviour change techniques such as motivational interviewing. The control group received a letter listing their preconception risks and encouraging them to talk with a clinician. The primary outcome was the proportion of identified risks at the action or maintenance stage of change at months 6 and 12. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01827215. Findings: From March 11, 2014, through July 8, 2018, 528 women recruited from 35 states and 242 cities across the USA received the Gabby intervention (n=262) or were assigned to the control group (n=266). Participants identified a mean of 21 preconception risks per woman (SD 9·9). In the intention-to-treat analysis, at 6 months, intervention women reported reaching the action or maintenance stage of change for 50·0% (SD 28·9) of those preconception risks identified compared with 42·7% (28·3) in the control group (incidence rate ratio 1·16, 95% CI 1·07–1·26; p=0·0004). This result persisted at 12 months. Interpretation: The Gabby system has the potential to improve women's preconception health. Further research is needed to determine if improving preconception risks impacts outcomes such as preterm delivery.

Most of the available designs have mainly focused on objective measurements, such as body movement, heart rate, and/or bedroom light, noise level, and temperature. However, due to the lack of users' subjective experience measurements, sleep trackers often fail to provide useful suggestions for improving their sleep. In this study, we developed SlumberBot with conversational chatbot technology to help users capture their subjective sleep experiences and relevant factors in daytime activities as well. With SlumberBot, we conducted a preliminary field study with five participants in a 4-week time period. The result shows that SlumberBot is easy to stay engaged with and supportive of users' self-reflection on contextual factors related to sleep quality. Besides, SlumberBot has shown the potential of triggering short-term behavior changes that would impact their sleep positively. © 2020 Owner/Author.

AB  - The notion of a persuasive technology (PT) that is autonomous and intelligent, and more importantly, cognizant of and sensitive to human sense of agency (SoA), i.e., the subjective feeling or judgement that oneself is in control of situations, remains to be theorized, conceptualized and elucidated. Three important questions have emerged from our investigations: (1) why does SoA matter in the design of PT, (2) what computational principles in artificial intelligence (AI) underlie an adaptive PT, and (3) how can this intelligent PT sense, make sense of, and respond sensibly to dynamic changes in SoA under complex settings? We elucidate in this paper our theoretical and computational frameworks to answer our research queries. For the theoretical aspect, we propose an integration of pertinent theories in the cognitive, social and neurosciences that explain the emergence and disruption of SoA. Using this integration as theory of mind, we propose a computational framework for SoA-aware persuasive AI that integrates methods in cooperative inverse reinforcement learning, causal inferencing, explainable AI planning and generative actor-critic learning. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a transmissible respiratory disease that was initially reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. With the alarming levels of COVID-19 spread worldwide, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. Over the past several months, chest CT has played a vital role in early identification, disease severity assessment, and dynamic disease course monitoring of COVID-19. The published data has enriched our knowledge on the etiology, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and pathologic findings of COVID-19. Additionally, as the imaging spectrum of the disease continues to be defined, extrapulmonary infections or other complications will require further attention. This review aims to provide an updated framework and essential knowledge with which radiologists can better understand COVID-19. © 2020 The Korean Society of Radiology.

AB  - Bayesian persuasion, as introduced by Kamenica and Gentzkow in 2011, is the study of information sharing policies among strategic agents. A prime example is signaling in online ad auctions: what information should a platform signal to an advertiser regarding a user when selling the opportunity to advertise to her? Practical considerations such as preventing discrimination, protecting privacy or acknowledging limited attention of the information receiver impose constraints on information sharing. We propose a simple way to mathematically model such constraints as restrictions on Receiver’s admissible posterior beliefs. We consider two families of constraints – ex ante and ex post; the latter limits each instance of Sender-Receiver communication, while the former more general family can also pose restrictions in expectation. For the ex ante family, a result of Doval and Skreta (2018) establishes the existence of an optimal signaling scheme with a small number of signals – at most the number of constraints plus the number of states of nature – and we show this result is tight. For the ex post family, we tighten the previous bound of Vølund (2018), showing that the required number of signals is at most the number of states of nature, as in the original Kamenica-Gentzkow setting. As our main algorithmic result, we provide an additive bi-criteria FPTAS for an optimal constrained signaling scheme assuming a constant number of states of nature; we improve the approximation to single-criteria under a Slater-like regularity condition. The FPTAS holds under standard assumptions, and more relaxed assumptions yield a PTAS. We then establish a bound on the ratio between Sender’s optimal utility under convex ex ante constraints and the corresponding ex post constraints. We demonstrate how this result can be applied to find an approximately welfare-maximizing constrained signaling scheme in ad auctions.

AB  - In a world of accelerating unending change, perpetual surveillance, and increasing connectivity, conflict has become ever more complex. Wars are no longer limited to the traditional military conflict domains-land, sea, air; even space and cyber space. The new battlefield will be the cognitive domain and the new conflict a larger contest for power; a contest for cognitive superiority. Written by experts in military operations research and neuropsychology, this book introduces the concept of cognitive superiority and provides the keys to succeeding within a complex matrix where the only rules are the laws of physics, access to information, and the boundaries of cognition. The book describes the adversarial environment and how it interacts with the ongoing, accelerating change that we are experiencing, irrespective of adversaries. It talks about the ascendant power of information access, pervasive surveillance, personalized persuasion, and emerging new forms of cognition. It profiles salient technologies and science, including persuasion science, artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), surveillance technologies, complex adaptive systems, network science, directed human modification, and biosecurity. Readers will learn about human and machine cognition, what makes it tick, and why and how we and our technologies are vulnerable. Following in the tradition of Sun-Tsu and von Clausewitz, this book writes a new chapter in the study of warfare and strategy. It is written for those who lead, aspire to leadership, and those who teach or persuade, especially in the fields of political science, military science, computer science, and business. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

AB  - A contractual mechanism to protect and amplify the interests of Indigenous community well-being in the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that affects them is investigated. Our proposal explores the need for a legal mechanism that recognizes the importance of cultural knowledge and ways of being and doing, acknowledging that these can be in tension with the (potentially myopic) goals of AI development. We outline the pre-conditions for such a legal mechanism to be possible, including some of the core components that could give rise to a termination for cultural misalignment, as well as the supporting types of governance structures and operating principles such a legal mechanism may engender. We discuss how the establishment of such a mechanism in contracts forces procurers of AI technology development services, and therefore developers of AI technology systems themselves, to adopt and enact principles by which they will work to protect and enable community well-being, thereby instigating important behavior change. Consideration is given to the types of knowledge, skills and training that would be required to implement such a mechanism successfully. This essay has a particular emphasis on working to ensure Indigenous community well-being in the development of AI, however there are also applications for other communities. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Digital addiction is becoming a prevalent societal concern and persuasive design techniques used in digital platforms might be accountable also for the development and maintenance of such problematic behavior. This paper theoretically analyses the relationship between persuasive system design principles and digital addiction in light of theories on behavioral and substance-based addictions. The findings suggest that some of the persuasive design principles, in specific contexts, may trigger and expedite digital addiction. The purpose of this paper is to open a discussion around the potential effects of persuasive technology on digital addiction and cater to this risk in the design processes and the persuasive design itself. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Innovation is a form of realising a new way of doing something, often ignoring traditional wisdom, in order to meet new challenges. Globally, particularly in emerging economies, the high burden of musculoskeletal conditions and their contribution to multimorbidity continue to rise, as does the gap for services to deliver essential care. There is a growing need to find solutions to this challenge and deliver person-centred and integrated care, wherein empowering patients with the capacity for self-management is critical. Whilst there is an abundance of information available online to support consumer education, the number of sources for credible medical information is diluted by uninformed anecdotal social media solutions. Even with the provision of high-quality information, behavioural change does not necessarily follow, and more robust educational approaches are required. In this chapter, we examine innovation, its management and the strategic directions required to improve musculoskeletal healthcare at macro (policy), meso (service delivery) and micro (clinical practice) levels. We discuss the critical role of consumer agency (patients and their families/carers) in driving innovation and the need to leverage this through empowerment by education. We provide a snapshot of real-world examples of innovative practices including capacity building in consumer and interprofessional musculoskeletal education and practice; recommendations to transform the access and delivery of integrated, person-centred care; and initiatives in musculoskeletal care and implementation of models of care, enabled by digital health solutions including telehealth, remote monitoring, artificial intelligence, blockchain technology and big data. We provide emerging evidence for how innovation can support systems' strengthening and build capacity to support improved access to ‘right’ musculoskeletal care, and explore some of the ways to best manage innovations. We conclude with recommended systematic steps to establish required leadership, collaboration, research, networking, dissemination, implementation and evaluation of future innovations in musculoskeletal health and care. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Functional Status Information (FSI) describes physical and mental wellness at the whole-person level, and includes information on activity performance, social role participation, and environmental and personal factors that affect well-being and quality of life. Collecting and analyzing this information is critical to addressing the data needs in caring for aging global populations, and providing effective care for individuals with chronic conditions, multi-morbidity, and disability. In this paper, we present a first step towards the design of Al-enabled system increasing the self-awareness of own functional status. In particular, we focus on the underlying semantic layer of the such an Al-enabled system by presenting two modules extending the HeLiS ontology aiming (i) to represent barriers in improving own functional status and (ii) to support the conceptual representation of the arguments leading to the detection of such barriers. Finally, we show through a running example how these modules can be instantiated. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Explanation in Artificial Intelligence is often focused on providing reasons for why a model under consideration and its outcome are correct. Recently, research in explainable machine learning has initiated a shift in focus on including so-called counterfactual explanations. In this paper we propose to combine both types of explanation in the context of explaining Bayesian networks. To this end we introduce persuasive contrastive explanations that aim to provide an answer to the question Why outcome t instead of t′? posed by a user. In addition, we propose an algorithm for computing persuasive contrastive explanations. Both our definition of persuasive contrastive explanation and the proposed algorithm can be employed beyond the current scope of Bayesian networks. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

Such missions, like other complex systems-of-systems, are likely to have previously-unknown, safety relevant anomalies occur due to many possible factors including system failures or degradations, emergent behavior, changes in the environment in which the systems operate, changes in the way the systems are operated. We discuss the application of anomaly detection, active learning, and precursor identification to identify such anomalies and the conditions under which they are more likely to appear.

AB  - In the 1980s our understanding of how advertising affects consumer behavior was undergoing a dramatic transformation. Recent theoretical and methodological advances in cognitive psychology, social cognition, and artificial intelligence were largely responsible for this transformation. These advances provided a better understanding of the information acquisition process and how information is stored in memory. Consequently, we have been able to incorporate memory, the processing of visual information and affect into our models of advertising effects. However, there were still many unanswered questions. Among these are: (1) Exactly what is the relationship between the different mediators of persuasion? (2) How is memory for advertising related to persuasion? (3) What are the theoretical underpinnings of attitude toward the advertisement? (4) What determines the effect of persuasion over time? (5) What factors affect attention to advertising? (6) What psychological processes occur during the watching of a television commercial? and (7) What factors affect individual differences in the processing of advertising messages? Originally published in 1985, the chapters in this volume provide insights into these questions. They are organized in terms of four psychological processes which contribute to our understanding of how advertising works. These are affective reactions to advertisements, persuasion, psychological processes during television viewing, and involvement. © 1985 Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

AB  - Modeling persuasive language has the potential to better facilitate our decision-making processes. Despite its importance, computational modeling of persuasion is still in its infancy, largely due to the lack of benchmark datasets that can provide quantitative labels of persuasive strategies to expedite this line of research. To this end, we introduce a large-scale multi-domain text corpus for modeling persuasive strategies in good-faith text requests. Moreover, we design a hierarchical weakly-supervised latent variable model that can leverage partially labeled data to predict such associated persuasive strategies for each sentence, where the supervision comes from both the overall document-level labels and very limited sentence-level labels. Experimental results showed that our proposed method outperformed existing semi-supervised baselines significantly.

AB  - While agent-based modelling languages naturally implement concurrency, the currently available languages for argumentation do not allow to explicitly model this type of interaction. In this paper we introduce a concurrent language for handling process arguing and communicating using a shared argumentation framework (reminding shared constraint store as in concurrent constraint). We introduce also basic expansions, contraction and revision procedures as main bricks for enforcement, debate, negotiation and persuasion. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Rhetorical arguments are used in negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to persuade his opponent to accept a proposal more readily. When more than one argument is generated, the proponent must compare them in order to select the most adequate for his interests. A way of comparing them is by means of their strength values. Related work propose a calculation based only on the components of the rhetorical arguments, i.e., the importance of the opponent’s goal and the certainty level of the beliefs that make up the argument. This work aims to propose a model for the calculation of the strength of rhetorical arguments, which is inspired on the pre-conditions of credibility and preferability stated by Guerini and Castelfranchi. Thus, we suggest the use of two new criteria to the strength calculation: the credibility of the proponent and the status of the opponent’s goal in the goal processing cycle. The model is empirically evaluated and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is more efficient than previous works in terms of number of exchanged arguments and number of reached agreements. © IBERAMIA and the authors.

AB  - Given the prevalent use of technology for human activities, the determinants of user perceptions of the credibility of technological systems must be understood. This study investigated how user perceptions of persuasive elements that are incorporated in Academic Social Networking Sites (ASNSs) influence the Perceived Credibility of these sites. Specifically, the effects of Personalization, Reduction, Tailoring, Self-Monitoring, Rehearsal, Simulation and Tunneling on Perceived Credibility are examined. An online survey was adopted to examine the research model. Partial Least Square techniques were used to assess the significance of the determinants on Perceived Credibility. Results indicate that Tailoring positively influences Perceived Credibility whereas Personalization has a negative significant effect. Implications for theoretical insights into Perceived Credibility and its determinants and design implication are discussed. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the known opinion formation problem from the point of view of computational collective intelligence research, with consideration to some sociological research in the area of social influence. We study two approaches to opinion formation–polarization and persuasion–as viewed from the point of view of our collective model (as opinion integration strategies). We detail both approaches and then conduct simulational experiments to study them both in single and averaged over multiple runs. We found special interest in the polarization strategy, which we want to use in the future as a basis for a new measure of collectives behavior. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Affective Computing refers to a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that aims to recognize, interpret, and adequately respond to human emotions. Human-machine interactions should thus become more individual and emotionally appealing. But what would our everyday life look like if such an emotionally intelligent artificial being became our best friend? This question was addressed by a multilinear development scenario that lets the reader experience different stages in the life of the protagonist from the first day in secondary school to the loss of a loved one in midlife. The subject of this sci-fi prototyping was the progressive power of emotional artificial intelligence, which becomes tangible in this multilinear story in four fictional stages in the future. In each stage, the reader is presented with a decision that affects the role of the artificially intelligent being in the protagonist's life. In this way, different versions of our digital future can be experienced with affective computing. © 2021 3rd European Conference on the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics, ECIAIR 2021.

AB  - Background: Chatbots empowered by artificial intelligence (AI) can increasingly engage in natural conversations and build relationships with users. Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet. Objective: The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations. Methods: We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing. Based on the identified gaps and opportunities, as well as our own clinical and research experience and findings, we propose an AI chatbot behavior change model. Results: Our review found a lack of understanding around theoretical guidance and practical recommendations on designing AI chatbots for lifestyle modification programs. The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper. Conclusions: As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation. There is a need for more interdisciplinary work to continue developing AI techniques to improve a chatbot's relational and persuasive capacities to change physical activity and diet behaviors with strong ethical principles. ©Jingwen Zhang, Yoo Jung Oh, Patrick Lange, Zhou Yu, Yoshimi Fukuoka.

AB  - This article introduces an early-stage depression identification technique without a physical presence in the medical unit. Currently used methods do not provide any early-stage depression detection techniques and require continuous investigation to diagnose depression. In general, depression detection is based on changes in human behavior. Changes in human behavior are also reflected in his/her mobile usage pattern. Mobile usage can correlate with human behavior and predict early-stage depression based on artificial intelligence (AI). The mobile usage data collected (e.g. location, activity, phone usage) can be used for effective depression screening. The proposed approach suggests using the user's mobile usage pattern and applying machine learning algorithms to identify the change in mobile usage patterns over time. The machine learning algorithm like Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) can be effectively used to identify the change in pattern. This change in mobile usage pattern is then used to detect if the user is slowly moving into depression and warn the individual or concerned authority to handle the case.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - As environmental pollution continues to expand, new ways for raising awareness for the consequences need to be explored. Virtual reality has emerged as an effective tool for behavioral change. This paper investigates if virtual reality applications controlled through physical activity can support an even stronger effect, because it enhances the attention and recall performance by stimulating the working memory through motor functions. This was tested in an experimental study using a virtual reality head-mounted display in combination with the ICAROS fitness device enabling participants to explore either a plastic-polluted or non-polluted sea. Results indicated that using a regular controller elicits more presence and a more intense Flow experience than the ICAROS condition, which people controlled via their physical activity. Moreover, the plastic-polluted stimulus was more effective in inducing attitude change than a nonpolluted sea.  © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the process of scientific research. AI, coupled with availability of large datasets and increasing computational power, is accelerating progress in areas such as genetics, climate change and astronomy [NeurIPS 2019 Workshop Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning, Vancouver, Canada; Hausen R, Robertson BE. Morpheus: A deep learning framework for the pixel-level analysis of astronomical image data. Astrophys J Suppl Ser. 2020;248:20; Dias R, Torkamani A. AI in clinical and genomic diagnostics. Genome Med. 2019;11:70.]. The application of AI in behavioral science is still in its infancy and realizing the promise of AI requires adapting current practices. Purposes: By using AI to synthesize and interpret behavior change intervention evaluation report findings at a scale beyond human capability, the HBCP seeks to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of research activities. We explore challenges facing AI adoption in behavioral science through the lens of lessons learned during the Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP). Methods: The project used an iterative cycle of development and testing of AI algorithms. Using a corpus of published research reports of randomized controlled trials of behavioral interventions, behavioral science experts annotated occurrences of interventions and outcomes. AI algorithms were trained to recognize natural language patterns associated with interventions and outcomes from the expert human annotations. Once trained, the AI algorithms were used to predict outcomes for interventions that were checked by behavioral scientists. Results: Intervention reports contain many items of information needing to be extracted and these are expressed in hugely variable and idiosyncratic language used in research reports to convey information makes developing algorithms to extract all the information with near perfect accuracy impractical. However, statistical matching algorithms combined with advanced machine learning approaches created reasonably accurate outcome predictions from incomplete data. Conclusions: AI holds promise for achieving the goal of predicting outcomes of behavior change interventions, based on information that is automatically extracted from intervention evaluation reports. This information can be used to train knowledge systems using machine learning and reasoning algorithms.  © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Ensuring that users can successfully perform their primary tasks and achieve their behavioral goals is critical for the success of persuasive system. Are user manuals needed to achieve this goal? In this paper, we sought to understand the role of end-user documentation for persuasive systems. 50 persuasive apps from the Google Play Store were analysed to determine the importance of user manuals or guides for persuasive health apps. Although based on a small data set, our results show that in most cases persuasive systems need user documentation and hence we encourage developers of such systems to allocate resources for creating quality documentation for their users. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Interactive narrative technologies for preventive health care offer significant potential for promoting health behavior change in adolescents. By improving adolescents’ knowledge, personal efficacy, and self-regulatory skills these technologies hold great promise for realizing positive impacts on adolescent health. These potential benefits are enabled through story-centric learning experiences that provide opportunities for adolescents to practice strategies to reduce risky health behaviors in engaging game-based environments. A distinctive feature of interactive narrative that promotes engagement is players’ ability to influence the story through the choices they make. In this paper, we present initial work investigating engagement in an interactive narrative that focuses on reducing adolescents’ risky behaviors around alcohol use. Specifically, we consider how the short-term and long-term goals adolescents choose as being important to the protagonist character relates to their engagement with the interactive narrative. Leveraging interaction log data from a pilot study with 20 adolescents, we conduct a cluster-based analysis of the goals players selected. We then examine how engagement differs between the identified clusters. Results indicate that adolescents’ choices for the protagonist’s short-term and long-term goals can significantly impact their engagement with the interactive narrative. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - We present a series of mHealth applications and studies pursued as part of the Fittle+ project. This program of research has the dual aims of (1) bringing scalable evidence-based behavior-change interventions to mHealth and evaluating them and (2) developing theoretically based predictive models to better understand the dynamics of the impact of these interventions on achieving behavior-change goals. Our approach in the Fittle+ systems rests on the idea that to master the complex fabric of a new healthy lifestyle, one must weave together a new set of healthy habits that over-ride the old unhealthy habits. To achieve these aims, we have developed a series of mHealth platforms that provide scaffolding interventions: Behavior-change techniques and associated mHealth interactions (e.g., SMS reminders; chatbot dialogs; user interface functionality; etc.) that provide additional support to the acquisition and maintenance of healthy habits. We present experimental evidence collected so far for statistically significant improvements in behavior change in eating, exercise, and physical activity for the following scaffolding interventions: guided mastery, teaming, self-affirmation, and implementation intentions. We also present predictive computational ACT-R models of daily individual behavior goal success for data collected in guided mastery and implementation intention studies that address goal-striving and habit formation mechanisms. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Latest studies regarding gamification for behavior change have suggested using meaningful stories for long-term effects. Drawing on psychological studies related to narrative transportation and mental simulation, this paper extends the idea of animated parables and argues that selecting stories to frame gamified systems should consider perceived causality between the real-life action and the simulated diegetic effect. This study employs expert evaluation on a collection of parables regarding perceived usefulness, novelty, and perceived causality. Results show that parables consensually rated by experts as both useful and novel are also prominent in perceived causality, which supports the argument that perceived causality underpins perceived persuasiveness of parables. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Argument structure elaborates the relation among claims and premises. Previous works in persuasiveness prediction seldom consider this relation in their architectures. To take argument structure information into account, this paper proposes an approach to persuasiveness prediction with a novel graphbased neural network model, called heterogeneous argument attention network (HARGAN). By jointly training on the persuasiveness and stance of the replies, our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ChangeMyView (CMV) dataset for the persuasiveness prediction task. Experimental results show that the graph setting enables our model to aggregate information across multiple paragraphs effectively. In the meanwhile, our stance prediction auxiliary task enables our model to identify the viewpoint of each party, and helps our model perform better on the persuasiveness prediction. & copy; 2021, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - We present the design of an online social skills development interface for teenagers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The interface is intended to enable private conversation practice anywhere, anytime using a web-browser. Users converse informally with a virtual agent, receiving feedback on nonverbal cues in realtime, and summary feedback. The prototype was developed in consultation with an expert UX designer, two psychologists, and a pediatrician. Using the data from 47 individuals, feedback and dialogue generation were automated using a hidden Markov model and a schema-driven dialogue manager capable of handling multi-topic conversations. We conducted a study with nine high-functioning ASD teenagers. Through a thematic analysis of post-experiment interviews, identified several key design considerations, notably: 1) Users should be fully briefed at the outset about the purpose and limitations of the system, to avoid unrealistic expectations. 2) An interface should incorporate positive acknowledgment of behavior change. 3) Realistic appearance of a virtual agent and responsiveness are important in engaging users. 4) Conversation personalization, for instance in prompting laconic users for more input and reciprocal questions, would help the teenagers engage for longer terms and increase the system's utility. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - This study examines the persuasion mechanism in product recommendations made by a voice-based conversational agent and explores whether the personalized content reflecting the customer's preferences and the agent's social role of a friend, rather than a secretary, generate a more positive attitude toward the product in the context of voice shopping. With the framework of dual modes of information-processing models, we hypothesized that the personalization of messages would be a central route with a greater impact on attitude for products with high involvement. By contrast, the social role of the conversational agent was expected to represent a peripheral route with a greater impact on products with low involvement. An experimental study was designed to test the effects of personalized content that reflected individual preferences for product attributes and a friend role of a voice agent with high and low product involvement. The results showed main effects of both personalization and the social role on building attitudes toward the product. Although no interaction effect for personalization and involvement was found, there was a significant interaction effect for the social role and involvement. This study contributes to persuasion theory by extending it to the interaction with a conversational agent. For practitioners, the study provides insights into the importance of the personalized content of recommendations and the need for consideration of an alternative social role in the design of voice shopping through a conversational agent. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Taking 1210 documents in the core database of web of science with keywords such as "Sports", "wearable", "Sports", "wearable devices" and "behavior performance" as the data source, this paper uses "cite space" software for visual processing and analysis, combs the application effect of wearable devices in sports in the form of knowledge map, and reveals its research trend Study the cooperative network and the evolution path. Results: 1) in terms of research power distribution, the United States is in the position of "outshining others", which leads the research direction of the effect of modern wearable devices in sports to a certain extent. In terms of continents, the top two are North America and Europe. The region with a relatively weak research strength is Africa. The research strength in Asia is mainly concentrated in China, South Korea and Japan, while other regions are relatively weak, and the research quality in China needs to be improved. 2) The high-yield authors and teams of sports artificial intelligence research focus on American colleges and universities, with the main research direction of developing and improving intelligent wearable devices for different groups based on machine learning and deep learning technology. 3) Research disciplines, such as medicine, computer science and engineering, are the leading research on the effect of wearable devices in sports. The contribution rate of sports discipline to research on the effect of wearable devices in sports is relatively low, but it is consistent with the characteristics of interdisciplinary integration in this research field. 4) The hot spots of wearable devices in sports research are divided into four clusters, specifically wearable devices and related technologies, wearable device monitoring indicators, wearable device intervention behavior changes, and wearable device intervention effects. Sports form, crowds, wearable technology and methods, research methods, behavior change and result effects are the effective ways to study the intervention effect of wearable devices in sports. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - This article is inspired by a pseudo Oxford-style debate, which was held in Tel Aviv University, Israel at the International Conference on Virtual Rehabilitation (ICVR) 2019, which is the official conference of the International Society for Virtual Rehabilitation. The debate, between two 2-person teams with a moderator, was organized by the ICVR Program committee to address the question “Will virtual rehabilitation replace clinicians?” It brought together five academics with technical, research, and/or clinical backgrounds—Gerry Fluet, Tal Krasovsky, Anat Lubetzky, Philippe Archambault, W. Geoffrey Wright—to debate the pros and cons of using virtual reality (VR) and related technologies to help assess, diagnose, treat, and track recovery, and more specifically investigate the likelihood that advanced technology will ultimately replace human clinicians. Both teams were assigned a side to defend, whether it represented their own viewpoint or not, and to take whatever positions necessary to make a persuasive argument and win the debate. In this paper we present a recapitulation of the arguments presented by both sides, and further include an in-depth consideration of the question. We attempt to judiciously lay out a number of arguments that fall along a spectrum from moderate to extreme; the most extreme and/or indefensible positions are presented for rhetorical and demonstrative purposes. Although there may not be a clear answer today, this paper raises questions which are related to the basic nature of the rehabilitation profession, and to the current and potential role of technology within it. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Increasing demand for mental health services and the expanding capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has driven the development of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs). To date, AI-based chatbots have been integrated into DMHIs to support diagnostics and screening, symptom management and behavior change, and content delivery. Areas covered: We summarize the current landscape of DMHIs, with a focus on AI-based chatbots. Happify Health’s AI chatbot, Anna, serves as a case study for discussion of potential challenges and how these might be addressed, and demonstrates the promise of chatbots as effective, usable, and adoptable within DMHIs. Finally, we discuss ways in which future research can advance the field, addressing topics including perceptions of AI, the impact of individual differences, and implications for privacy and ethics. Expert opinion: Our discussion concludes with a speculative viewpoint on the future of AI in DMHIs, including the use of chatbots, the evolution of AI, dynamic mental health systems, hyper-personalization, and human-like intervention delivery. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Chatbots are versatile tools that have the potential of being used for computational persuasion where the chatbot acts as the persuader and the human agent as the persuadee. To allow the user to type his or her arguments, as opposed to selecting them from a menu, the chatbot needs a sufficiently large knowledge base of arguments and counterarguments. And in order to make the user change their current stance on a subject, the chatbot needs a method to select persuasive counterarguments. To address this, we present a chatbot that is equipped with an argument graph and the ability to identify the concerns of the user argument in order to select appropriate counterarguments. We evaluate the bot in a study with participants and show how using our method can make the chatbot more persuasive. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper presents a user-study with Emys social robot that aims to persuade subjects to select a less-desirable choice. In this study, within a game scenario, Emys attempts to use its social power resources, specifically reward power, to persuade the user to select an alternative such that the user indicates less interest in it. This persuasion attempt is repeated over three times to investigate this effect within repeated persuasion instances. The study consists of three conditions: no/low/high reward. The results indicated that the higher reward does not necessarily lead to higher persuasion and the effect of social power does not decay over repeated persuasion instances. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Chatbots have the potential of being used as dialogical argumentation systems for behaviour change applications. They thereby offer a cost-effective and scalable alternative to in-person consultations with health professionals that users could engage in from the comfort of their own home. During events like the global COVID-19 pandemic, it is even more important than usual that people are well informed and make conscious decisions that benefit themselves. Getting a COVID-19 vaccine is a prime example of a behaviour that benefits the individual, as well as society as a whole. In this paper, we present a chatbot that engages in dialogues with users who do not want to get vaccinated, with the goal to persuade them to change their stance and get a vaccine. The chatbot is equipped with a small repository of arguments that it uses to counter user arguments on why the user is reluctant to get a vaccine. We evaluate our chatbot in a study with participants. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Research question: What are the effects of using a fertility education chatbot, i.e. automatic conversation programme, on knowledge, intentions to improve preconception behaviour and anxiety? Design: A three-armed, randomized controlled trial was conducted using an online social research panel. Participants included 927 women aged 20–34 years who were randomly allocated to one of three groups: a fertility education chatbot (intervention group), a document about fertility and preconception health (control group 1) or a document about an irrelevant topic (control group 2). Participants’ scores on the Cardiff Fertility Knowledge Scale and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, their intentions to optimize preconception behaviours, e.g. taking folic acid, and the free-text feedback provided by chatbot users were assessed. Results: A repeated-measures analysis of variance showed significant fertility knowledge gains after the intervention in the intervention group (+9.1 points) and control group 1 (+14.9 points) but no significant change in control group 2 (+1.1 points). Post-test increases in the intentions to optimize behaviours were significantly higher in the intervention group than in control group 2, and were similar to those in control group 1. Post-test state anxiety scores were significantly lower in the intervention group than in control group 1 and control group 2. User feedbacks about the chatbot suggested technical limitations, e.g. low comprehension of users’ words, and pros and cons of using the chatbot, e.g. convenient versus coldness. Conclusions: Providing fertility education using a chatbot improved fertility knowledge and intentions to optimize preconception behaviour without increasing anxiety, but the improvement in knowledge was small. Further technical development and exploration of personal affinity for technology is required. © 2020 Reproductive Healthcare Ltd.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 crisis and consequent confinement restrictions have caused significant psychosocial stress and reports of sleep complaints, which require early management, have increased during recent months. To help individuals concerned about their sleep, we developed a smartphone-based app called KANOPEE that allows users to interact with a virtual agent dedicated to autonomous screening and delivering digital behavioral interventions. Objective: Our objective was to assess the feasibility of this app, in terms of inclusion rate, follow-up rate, perceived trust and acceptance of the virtual agent, and effects of the intervention program, in the context of COVID-19 confinement in France. Methods: The virtual agent is an artificial intelligence program using decision tree architecture and interacting through natural body motion and natural voice. A total of 2069 users aged 18 years and above downloaded the free app during the study period (April 22 to May 5, 2020). These users first completed a screening interview based on the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) conducted by the virtual agent. If the users were positive for insomnia complaints (ISI score >14), they were eligible to join the 2-stage intervention program: (1) complete an electronic sleep diary for 1 week and (2) follow personalized sleep recommendations for 10 days. We collected and analyzed the following measures: sociodemographic information, ISI scores and sleep/wake schedules, and acceptance and trust of the agent. Results: Approximately 76% (1574/2069) of the app users completed the screening interview with the virtual agent. The virtual agent was well accepted by 27.4% (431/1574) of the users who answered the acceptance and trust questionnaires on its usability, satisfaction, benevolence, and credibility. Of the 773 screened users who reported sleep complaints (ISI score >14), 166 (21.5%) followed Step 1 of the intervention, and only 47 of those (28.3%) followed Step 2. Users who completed Step 1 found that their insomnia complaints (baseline mean ISI score 18.56, mean ISI score after Step 1 15.99; P<.001) and nocturnal sleep quality improved significantly after 1 week. Users who completed Step 2 also showed an improvement compared to the initial measures (baseline mean ISI score 18.87, mean ISI score after Step 2 14.68; P<.001). Users that were most severely affected (ISI score >21) did not respond to either intervention. Conclusions: These preliminary results suggest that the KANOPEE app is a promising solution to screen populations for sleep complaints and that it provides acceptable and practical behavioral advice for individuals reporting moderately severe insomnia. © 2020 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) plays various roles in our daily lives, such as personal assistant, salesperson, and virtual counselors; thus, it stands out in various fields as a recommendation agent. This study explored the effects of perceived similarity and psychological distance on the persuasion of AI recommendation agents through two experiments. Results of Experiment 1 elucidated that individuals feel more psychologically distant when they interact with AI recommendation agents than with human agents as a result of a different level of perceived similarity. Furthermore, psychological distance plays a mediating role in determining the effectiveness of desirability- vs. feasibility-focused messages in health-related issues. In Experiment 2, we manipulated the AI speaker's level of perceived similarity via anthropomorphism and found that the AI's recommendation with secondary (vs. primary) features is more effective when AI is humanized, and the reverse was found in non-humanized AI conditions. Both theoretical and managerial implications are provided. © 2021 Advertising Association.

AB  - Scientists and researchers are exploring different methods of generating and delivering electrical energy in an economical and reliable way, enabling them to generate electricity focusing on renewable energy resources. All of these possess the natural property of self-changing behavior, so the connection of these separate independent controllable units to the grid leads to uncertainties. This creates an imbalance in active power and reactive power. In order to control the active and reactive power in wind turbine generators with adjustable speed, various control strategies are used to allay voltage and current variations. This research work is focused on the design and implementation of effective control strategies for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) to control its active and reactive power. A DFIG system with its control strategies is simulated on MATLAB software. To augment the transient stability of DFIG, the simulation results for the active and reactive power of conventional controllers are compared with three types of feed forward neural network controllers, i.e., probabilistic feedforward neural network (PFFNN), multi-layer perceptron feedforward neural network (MLPFFN) and radial basic function feedforward neural network (RBFFN) for optimum performance. Conclusive outcomes clearly manifest the superior robustness of the RBFNN controller over other controllers in terms of rise time, settling time and overshoot value. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - While the market of smart technologies is steadily increasing, there is much research to be done regarding the interaction between human users and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. Specifically, the field of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) focuses on making AI explainable to users. To provide a user-centered approach to this growing field, this paper describes a study to investigate possible processes and methods. For this purpose, 20 participants were asked to use an AI system that provided them with the results of a personalized COVID-19 risk calculation. The study results indicate that while participants generally seemed to think that the presented results of the system were accurate, only a few said that they would change their behavior after receiving the results, and many asked for additional information to better understand the results. This paper discusses the findings along with possible approaches to increase behavior change in users of smart systems.  © 2021 Croatian Society MIPRO.

AB  - Automated vehicle technology is becoming increasingly mature with the development of Artificial Intelligence and information communications technology. It is important to understand the factors affecting the use of automated vehicles. This study investigates user acceptance and the willingness to use fully driverless cars (self-driving cars). Based on Social Cognitive Theory (SCT), we developed a new acceptance model to explore the impact of mass media on adopting self-driving cars. A survey was designed and distributed, and 173 responded. The results show that 84.4% of the respondents are willing to accept driverless cars. At this early stage, the reports from mass media significantly influence people's perception of self-driving cars. The media affect self-efficacy and subjective norms, and thereby people's trust and behavior change. Moreover, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and trust significantly influence their intention to use self-driving cars. This article provides practical guidance to promote self-driving cars: positive media reports will significantly enhance people's trust and intention to use driverless cars. © 2020 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies

AB  - 6G is anticipated to become more human-centered than 5G and should not only explore more spectrum at high-frequency bands but, more importantly, converge driving technological trends such as blockchain technologies and connected robotics. This paper focuses on the emerging field of robonomics, which studies the sociotechnical impact of blockchain technologies on social human-robot interaction and behavioral economics for the social integration of robots into human society. Advanced blockchain technologies such as oracles enable the on-chaining of blockchain-external off-chain information stemming from human users. In doing so, they leverage on human intelligence rather than machine learning only. In this paper, we investigate the widely studied trust game of behavioral economics in a blockchain context, paying close attention to the importance of developing efficient cooperation and coordination technologies. After identifying open research challenges of blockchain-enabled implementations of the trust game, we first develop a smart contract that replaces the experimenter in the middle between trustor and trustee and demonstrate experimentally that a social efficiency of up to 100% can be achieved by using deposits to enhance both trust and trustworthiness. We then present an on-chaining oracle architecture for a networked $N$ -player trust game that involves a third type of human agents called observers, who track the players' investment and reciprocity. The presence of third-party reward and penalty decisions helps raise the average normalized reciprocity above 80%, even without requiring any deposit. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate that mixed logical-affective persuasive strategies for social robots improve the trustees' trustworthiness and reciprocity significantly.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - For a significant number of years, scientists of many persuasions have assayed natural product materials ranging from crude extracts to pure compounds, in a multitude of assays causally related to some biological processes. However, in a very significant number of submitted papers and published articles, what may be considered as canned biological assays were used, and if a positive effect was observed, then the authors would claim that the material assayed was a potential drug lead. This also occurred with pure synthetic compounds and compounds derived from natural products by simple chemical modifications. However, what has now become quite obvious—with all such classes of materials—is that there are many promiscuous players with multiple bioactivities. These can range from relatively crude extracts, pure compounds from natural products, synthetic processes that produce natural product derivatives, and even compounds that are truly synthetic in origin. There is also a potential problem with the data from crude to purified extracts being used to claim some form of beneficial activities for such materials, to sell that particular mixture to the lay public, by very careful descriptions of its possible uses due to legal hurdles. With the advent of artificial intelligence and very large compound databases, some of which may well contain impure materials, scientists from a variety of backgrounds have begun to utilize such listings to obtain compounds for their low to high throughput biological screens, without realizing that there are very significant numbers of active compounds (eg, pan assay interference compounds and invalid metabolic panaceas), that will hit in many different screens for a variety of reasons, thus leading to significant wasted efforts and published scientific articles that have incorrect results. This commentary gives some of the history of such materials but is designed to be used as a warning to both researchers and in particular, journal editors, and reviewers, that reports of biological results that are claimed to be the result of the compounds used, need to be very carefully screened for results due to such promiscuous compounds, irrespective of their nominal source(s). All literature searches were made by the author and the background knowledge has come from more than 55 years of research in industry and governmental laboratories in both the United Kingdom and the United States, for enzyme inhibitors/activators as well as antimicrobial and antitumor lead compounds mainly from natural product sources. The conclusion that I came up with as a result is this: Caveat emptor. (Curr Ther Res Clin Exp. 2021; 82:XXX–XXX) © 2021 Elsevier HS Journals, Inc. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - Increasing automation calls for evaluating the effectiveness and intelligence of automated vehicles. This paper proposes a framework for quantitatively evaluating the intelligence of automated vehicles. Firstly, we establish the evaluation environment for automated vehicles including test field, test task, and evaluation index. The test tasks include the single vehicle decision-making (turning, lane-changing, overtaking, etc.) and the maneuver execution of multi-vehicle interaction (obstacle avoidance, trajectory optimization, etc.). The intelligence evaluation index is the action amount of driving process considering the safety, efficiency, rationality and comfort. Then, we calculate the actual action amount of the automated vehicle in different scenarios in the test field. Finally, the least action calculated theoretically corresponds to the highest intelligence degree of the automated vehicle, and is employed as a standard to quantify the performance of other tested automated vehicles. The effectiveness of this framework is verified with two naturalistic driving datasets that contain the normal driving scenarios and high-risk scenarios. Specifically, the naturalistic lane-changing data filters 40,416 frames and 179 similar lane-changing trajectories. Compared with the lane-changing behavior of a large number of drivers, experimental results verify that the proposed algorithm can achieve the intelligence degree of drivers in the lane change scenario. Meanwhile, in 253 reconstructed high-risk scenarios, the intelligent risk avoidance ability of the proposed intelligence degree evaluation algorithm can be verified by comparing with the driver behavior and TTC algorithm. These experimental results show that the proposed framework can effectively quantify intelligence and evaluate the performance of automated vehicles under various scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Sustainable energy is hands down one of the biggest challenges of our times. As the EU sets its focus to reach its 2030 and 2050 goals, the importance of energy efficiency for energy consumers/prosumers becomes prevalent. Over the years, a lot of different approaches have been followed to engage end-users and affect energy-related occupant behaviour towards improving energy efficiency results and long term behaviour changes. This work presents the SIT4Energy user-centered approach for tertiary buildings that delivers an end-to-end solution that takes into consideration a set of tools and models for successfully engaging and affecting the end-user’s energy-related behaviour. Starting from appropriate user profiling models for energy-related behaviour models and an explainable recommendation engine, to on the fly human activity tracking and micro-moments detection on mobile devices, a set of recommendations are delivered to the end-users through a mobile device, presenting valuable information with user-tailored context and on the optimal timing. The overall solution is clearly documented, whereas real-life results are presented from the deployment in offices in a university building. From the evaluation performed it is clearly depicted that a positive impact has been achieved both in terms of energy efficiency as well as energy-related behaviour. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Persuasive designs, including gamification and digital nudging, have become well renowned during the last years and have been implemented successfully across different sectors including education, e-health, e-governance, e-finance and general information systems. In this regard, persuasive design can support desirable changes in attitude and behavior of users in order to achieve their own goals. However, such persuasive influence on individuals raises ethical questions as persuasive designs can impair the autonomy of users or persuade the user towards goals of a third party and hence lead to unethical decision-making processes. In human-computer interaction this is especially significant with the advent of advanced artificial intelligence that can emulate human behavior and thus bring new dynamics into play. Therefore, we conduct a systematic literature analysis with the goal to compile an overview of ethical considerations for persuasive system design, derive potential guidelines for ethical persuasive designs and shed light on potential research gaps. © AMCIS 2021.

AB  - What distinguishes the field of artificial intelligence (AI) from others is to develop fully independent agents that learn optimal behavior, change, and evolve solely through the communication of trial and error with the surrounding environment. Reinforcement learning (RL) can be seen in multiple aspects of Machine Learning (ML), provided the environment, reward, actions, the state will be defined. Agent training in previous years is seen to only relate to robotics, games, and self-driving cars. While trying to divert the focus of researchers from the view of self-driving cars, games, robots, etc. Here, we investigated using reinforcement learning in the aspect of task completion. We deployed our architecture in an inpainting task where the agent generates the distorted or missing image content into an eminent fidelity completed the image by using reinforcement learning to influence the generative model utilized. The Generative Adversary Network (GAN) problem of not being steady and challenging to train was overwhelmed by utilizing latent space representation. The dimension is reduced compared to the distorted or corrupted image in training the GAN. Then reinforcement learning was deployed to pick the correct GAN input to get the image's latent space representation that is most suitable for the current input of the missing or distorted image region. In this paper, we also learned that the trained agent enhances the accuracy in a classification task of images with missing data. We successfully examined the classification enhancement on images missing 30%, 50%, and 70%.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - A broad range of aspects are needed to be taken into consideration in the design and development of personalized coaching systems based on artificial intelligence methodologies. This research presents the initial phase of joining different professional and stakeholder perspectives on behavior change technologies into a flexible design proposal for a digital coaching system. The diversity and sometimes opposed views on content, behavior, purposes and context were managed using a structured argument-based design approach, which also feed into the behavior of the personalized system. Results include a set of personalization strategies that will be further elaborated with the target user group to manage sensitive issues such as ethics, social norms, privacy, motivation, autonomy and social relatedness. © 2020 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Artificial intelligence chatbots are the vanguard in technology-based intervention to change people's behavior. To develop intervention chatbots, the first step is to understand natural language conversation strategies in human conversation. This work introduces an intervention conversation dataset collected from a real-world physical activity intervention program for women. We designed comprehensive annotation schemes in four dimensions (domain, strategy, social exchange, and taskfocused exchange) and annotated a subset of dialogs. We built a strategy classifier with context information to detect strategies from both trainers and participants based on the annotation. To understand how human intervention induces effective behavior changes, we analyzed the relationships between the intervention strategies and the participants' changes in the barrier and social support for physical activity. We also analyzed how participant's baseline weight correlates to the amount of occurrence of the corresponding strategy. This work lays the foundation for developing a personalized physical activity intervention bot.  ©2021 Association for Computational Linguistics.

AB  - Persuasive Technologies can cause behavior change for improving child health care. However, for persuasive technology to be effective, users have to accept it. We propose a model of determinants of users’ acceptance of persuasive technologies that contains five constructs from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), which were used as latent variables determining users’ acceptance to use a persuasive intervention for child healthcare. A structured questionnaire was validated and completed by 133 participants to assess their perceptions. Results indicate that Perceived Usefulness, Content of Intervention and Perceived Credibility can have a significant influence on Intention to Use the Intervention. The result support our proposed model of determinants of acceptance of persuasive technology. The most important conclusion of this model is that when users perceive an intervention as being credible and useful, they are most motivated to accept and adopt it. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Systems aiming to aid consumers in their decision-making (e.g., by implementing persuasive techniques) are more likely to be effective when consumers trust them. However, recent research has demonstrated that the machine learning algorithms that often underlie such technology can act unfairly towards specific groups (e.g., by making more favorable predictions for men than for women). An undesired disparate impact resulting from this kind of algorithmic unfairness could diminish consumer trust and thereby undermine the purpose of the system. We studied this effect by conducting a between-subjects user study investigating how (gender-related) disparate impact affected consumer trust in an app designed to improve consumers’ financial decision-making. Our results show that disparate impact decreased consumers’ trust in the system and made them less likely to use it. Moreover, we find that trust was affected to the same degree across consumer groups (i.e., advantaged and disadvantaged users) despite both of these consumer groups recognizing their respective levels of personal benefit. Our findings highlight the importance of fairness in consumer-oriented artificial intelligence systems. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Systems that aim at supporting users on behavior change are expected to implement strategies that can both motivate and gain the users’ trust, like the use of human understandable justifications for system’s decisions. While the literature has dedicated great effort on providing accurate system’s decisions, less focus has been given on addressing the problem of explaining to the user the reasons for a decision. This work presents a SPARQL-based reasoner enabling explainability on systems thought for supporting users in following healthy lifestyles. Our results demonstrate that users that received such information were able to reduce unhealthy behaviors over time. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Several mitigation strategies in form of warning messages against phishing attacks have continued to fail largely due to user negligence. Thus, it is important for researchers to focus not only on the accuracy of the provided recommendations but also on other factors that influence the acceptance of recommendations and the extent to which these recommendations are convincing or persuasive. In this paper, we present our ongoing approach that leverages on the Big 5 Personality trait model and users digital traces harvested from their social networks, thereafter, transformed into a personalized warning message. We argue that stimulating users through personal recommendations evokes an understanding of the implications of their actions or inaction. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - It is shown that Aristotelian dialectic can be analyzed as having two parts: a core formal model that has a formal dialogue structure and a set of ten definable supplementary characteristics that lie outside the core structure. Some current argumentation tools used in artificial intelligence and multi-agent systems are applied to the task of extending the core formal model to include the supplementary characteristics. Using these tools it is explained how the structure of a dialogue can be mapped into an argument diagram that can be analyzed and evaluated using standard argumentation techniques such as argumentation schemes, types of dialogue, critical questions and a dialectical concept of burden of proof. Disputed issues on how the elenchus fits the standard dialogue typology are discussed, and it is concluded that it fits best into a type of dialogue called examination dialogue that is closely related to persuasion dialogue. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Emerging digital tools have the potential to enable a new generation of qualitative and quantitative assessment of cognitive performance. Moreover, the ubiquity of consumer electronics, such as smartphones and tablets, can be harnessed to support large-scale self-assessed cognitive screening with benefit to healthcare systems and consumers. A wide variety of apps, wearables, and new digital technologies are either available or in development for the detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a risk factor for dementia. Two categories of novel methodologies may be considered: passive technologies (which monitor a user’ behavior without active user input) and interactive assessments (which require active user input). Such examinations can be self-administered, supervised by a caregiver, or conducted by an informant at home or outside of a clinical setting. These direct-to-consumer tools have the potential to sidestep barriers associated with cognitive evaluation in primary care, thus improving access to cognitive assessments. Although direct-to-consumer cognitive assessment is associated with its own barriers, including test validation, user experience, and technological concerns, it is conceivable that these issues can be addressed so that a large-scale, selfassessed cognitive evaluation that would represent an initial cognitive screen may be feasible in the future. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Adherence to the complex set of recommended self-care practices among people with Sickle-Cell Disease (SCD) positively impacts health outcomes. However, few patients possess the required skills (i.e. disease-specific knowledge, adequate levels of self-efficacy). Consequently, adherence rates remain low and only 1% of patients are empowered enough to master the self-care practices. Health coaching and therapeutic patient education have emerged as new approaches to enhance patients' self-management and support health behavior changes. This preliminary feasibility study examined patients' perceived usefulness of the information provided by a chatbot we developed following patient-important requirements collected during our preliminary studies. Participants tested the chatbot and completed a post-test survey. A total of 19 patients were enrolled and 2 withdrew. 15 respondents (15/17, 88%) gave a score of at least 3/4 to the question “The chatbot contains all the information I need”. Results suggest that mHealth coaching apps could be used to promote the knowledge acquisition of recommended health behaviors related to the prevention of SCD main symptoms. © 2020 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

AB  - Self-explanations in decision support systems need to be presented in parallel with considering and understanding the outcomes of advice from the expert system. This advice can realise benefits such as increased user acceptance and confidence in the adoption of the improved system. There are numerous categories of explanation, including the following. In order for an expert system to reach a conclusion, there needs to be: (1) justification and a record of the inferential steps; (2) an explicit knowledge of the underlying argument, or (3) explanation of the rationale behind each inferential measure taken by the expert system. This recommendation will result in more persuasive justification and lead to satisfaction, and acceptance of advice. For this reason, it is proposed to announce a discourse semantics approach to an Intelligent Decision Support System framework by the inclusion of a discourse layer. In this paper, the discourse semantics layer approach will be demonstrated to show the mechanism of how a fuzzy logic based expert system utilises justification techniques for advice offered in the problem of control and resource management. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The aim of this article is to propose a model for the measurement of the strength of rhetorical arguments (i.e., threats, rewards, and appeals), which are used in persuasive negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to convince his opponent to accept a proposal. Related articles propose a calculation based on the components of the rhetorical arguments, that is, the importance of the goal of the opponent and the certainty level of the beliefs that make up the argument. Our proposed model is based on the pre-conditions of credibility and preferability stated by Guerini and Castelfranchi. Thus, we suggest the use of two new criteria for the strength calculation: the credibility of the proponent and the status of the goal of the opponent in the goal processing cycle. We use three scenarios in order to illustrate our proposal. Besides, the model is empirically evaluated and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is more efficient than previous works of the state of the art in terms of numbers of negotiation cycles, number of exchanged arguments, and number of reached agreements. © The Author(s), 2020.

AB  - Agent-based emotional persuasion is a relatively intelligent and advanced form of Agent-based automated negotiation in business intelligence. The interaction model is the key to ensuring the smooth completion of automated negotiations. In view of the insufficient research on quantification of model in the existing research that lead to the insufficient utilized of intelligence of Agent and other artificial intelligence advantages, the Agent-based emotional persuasion interaction process was analyzed, the corresponding interaction flow chart was drawn, and the corresponding interaction rules were designed. With the buyer Agent as the main body, the emotional persuasion correction factor and the target correction factor were introduced, the corresponding proposed correction function was constructed, and the corresponding interaction function was constructed. By using the multi-attribute utility theory and the expected utility theory, the algorithm of emotional persuasion correction factor was given. Based on the target conflict theory and regret theory, the algorithm of target correction factor was given, and the algorithm of interaction function was also given. The proposed interaction rules and interaction functions proposed were combined, and the emotional persuasion interaction model based on Agent was proposed. Taking the buyers and suppliers in the coal industry supply chain management as an example, the case analysis and sensitivity analysis were carried out to verify the rationality and effectiveness of the model, and the corresponding management inspiration was obtained through the conclusion. © 2020, Editorial Department of CIMS.

AB  - Conversational user interfaces open up new opportunities for reflection guidance. This paper presents a computer-mediated dialogue structure for reflecting on learning tasks, Rebo Junior, and its evaluation in the context of apprenticeship training. We answer three research questions. Firstly, how apprentices react to Rebo Junior; secondly, whether Rebo Junior's dialogue structure is apt to lead apprentices in reflective conversations; and thirdly, how user engagement with Rebo Junior develops over time. During three months, 17 apprentices led 153 reflective conversations with Rebo Junior in the context of a training workshop, 117 in phase one and 36 in phase two of the study (five to thirteen interactions per apprentice). We coded interactions manually for coherence, level of reflectivity, and user engagement. Our results show that apprentices react well to the intervention and that the dialogue structure is successful in leading apprentices through different levels of reflection (114 out of 153 showed observable reflection on the learning experience; 133 out of 153 expressed learning or planned behaviour change for future tasks). Furthermore, the interactions between the apprentices and Rebo Junior result in coherent conversations (149 out of 153 were coherent). Contrary to expectations, engagement did not decrease over time in either phase. With the present paper, we therefore publish a dialogue structure for reflecting on learning tasks that has worked extremely well despite no adaptivity in the conversational interface. Overall, we interpret the results of our work as underscoring the importance of dialogue structure quality in conversational agents. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Compromising smoking cessation applications’ effectiveness, many users relapse. We propose that long-term adoption of persuasive technology is (partly) dependent on users’ motivational orientation. Therefore, we studied the potential relationship between user’s achievement motivation and the long-term behavior change effectiveness of persuasive technology. One-hundred users of a smoking cessation app filled out a questionnaire assessing their motivational orientation and (long-term) behavior change rates. Based on research findings, we expected that participants with stronger learning goal orientation (who are focused on self-improvement and persistent when facing failure) would report a higher long-term behavior change success rate. In contrast, we expected that participants with a stronger performance goal orientation (focused on winning, for whom solitary failures can undermine intrinsic motivation) would report lower long-term success. Results confirmed our hypotheses. This research broadens our understanding of how persuasive applications’ effectiveness relates to user achievement motivation. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - As avid users of technology, adolescents are a key demographic to engage when designing and developing technology applications for health. There are multiple opportunities for improving adolescent health, from promoting preventive behaviors to providing guidance for adolescents with chronic illness in supporting treatment adherence and transition to adult health care systems. This article will provide a brief overview of current technologies and then highlight new technologies being used specifically for adolescent health, such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and machine learning. Because there is paucity of evidence in this field, we will make recommendations for future research. © 2020 by the American Academy of Pediatrics

AB  - As interest in and use of telehealth during the COVID-19 global pandemic increase, the potential of digital health to increase access and quality of mental health is becoming clear. Although the world today must "flatten the curve"of spread of the virus, we argue that now is the time to "accelerate and bend the curve"on digital health. Increased investments in digital health today will yield unprecedented access to high-quality mental health care. Focusing on personal experiences and projects from our diverse authorship team, we share selected examples of digital health innovations while acknowledging that no single piece can discuss all the impressive global efforts past and present. Exploring the success of telehealth during the present crisis and how technologies like apps can soon play a larger role, we discuss the need for workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity among other factors critical for bending the curve further. © John Torous, Keris Jän Myrick, Natali Rauseo-Ricupero, Joseph Firth.

AB  - Healthy diets have been demonstrated to complement benefits of physical activity, physical condition and mental wellbeing, all of them being important factors influencing the quality of life of elderly. Unfortunately malnutrition is a serious threat and an increasingly prevalent condition among the fast-growing elderly population. The present work addresses the identification of important factors contributing to decreased appetite and food intake as well as the development of approaches towards a healthy diet and personalised nutrition in elderly. Within the present study semi-structured interviews with elderly and elderly suffering from swallowing and mastication difficulties have been performed, results being used for the development of food provision modules and the corresponding recipes addressing the nutritional requirements of elderly. The social context and the swallowing and mastication difficulties influence the eating behaviour as well as the motivation to eat. On the other hand, it was found that texture modified foods (food which texture is adapted to the need of people with swallowing and mastication problems) could act as motivational aspect. With regard to food personalisation in the elderly the consideration of three different case scenarios based on individual independency and the degree of oral impairment seemed to be appropriate. Different aspects such as gender weight, physical activity level as well as high protein demand are important influential factors in the development of personalised recipes in elderly. In addition to the above, a conversational agent was developed as behaviour change module and can be successfully used as smart personal assistant in helping the users to understand their eating habits and adopt healthier nutrition over the long term. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Digital therapeutics is a newly described concept in healthcare which is proposed to change patient behavior and treat medical conditions using a variety of digital technologies. However, the term is rarely defined with criteria that make it distinct from simply digitizedversions of traditional therapeutics. Our objective is to describe a more valuable characteristic of digital therapeutics, which is distinct from traditional medicine or therapy: that is, the utilization of artificial intelligence and machine learning systems to monitor and predict individual patient symptom data in an adaptive clinical feedback loop via digital biomarkers to provide a precision medicine approach to healthcare. Artificial intelligence platforms can learn and predict effective interventions for individuals using a multitude of personal variables to provide a customized and more tailored therapy regimen. Digital therapeutics coupled with artificial intelligence and machine learning also allows more effective clinical observations and management at the population level for various health conditions and cohorts. This vital differentiation of digital therapeutics compared to other forms of therapeutics enables a more personalized form of healthcare that actively adapts to patients' individual clinical needs, goals, and lifestyles. Importantly, these characteristics are what needs to be emphasized to patients, physicians, and policy makers to advance the entire field of digital healthcare. © 2020 The Author(s) Published by S.

AB  - There is an emerging trend for sellers to use videos to promote their products on e-commerce platforms such as Taobao.com. Current video production workflow includes the production of visual storyline by human directors. We propose a system to automatically generate visual storyline based on the input set of visual materials (e.g. video clips or still images) and then produce a promotional video. In particular, we propose an algorithm called Shot Composition, Selection and Plotting (ShotCSP), which generates visual storylines leveraging film-making principles to improve viewing experience and perceived persuasiveness. © 2020 The Twenty-Fifth AAAI/SIGAI Doctoral Consortium (AAAI-20).

AB  - Background: Social distancing and shielding measures have been put in place to reduce social interaction and slow the transmission of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). For older people, self-isolation presents particular challenges for mental health and social relationships. As time progresses, continued social distancing could have a compounding impact on these concerns. Objective: This project aims to provide a tool for older people and their families and peers to improve their well-being and health during and after regulated social distancing. First, we will evaluate the tool’s feasibility, acceptability, and usability to encourage positive nutrition, enhance physical activity, and enable virtual interaction while social distancing. Second, we will be implementing the app to provide an online community to assist families and peer groups in maintaining contact with older people using goal setting. Anonymized data from the app will be aggregated with other real-world data sources to develop a machine learning algorithm to improve the identification of patients with COVID-19 and track for real time use by health systems. Methods: Development of this project is occurring at the time of publication, and therefore, a case study design was selected to provide a systematic means of capturing software engineering in progress. The app development framework for software design was based on agile methods. The evaluation of the app’s feasibility, acceptability and usability shall be conducted using Public Health England's guidance on evaluating digital health products, Bandura’s model of health promotion, the Reach Effectiveness Adoption Implementation Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework and the Nonadoption, Abandonment and Challenges to the Scale-up, Spread and Suitability (NASSS) framework. Results: Making use of a pre-existing software framework for health behavior change, a proof of concept was developed, and a multistage app development and deployment for the solution was created. Grant submissions to fund the project and study execution have been sought at the time of publication, and prediscovery iteration of the solution has begun. Ethical approval for a feasibility study design is being sought. Conclusions: This case study lays the foundations for future app development to combat mental and societal issues arising from social distancing measures. The app will be tested and evaluated in future studies to allow continuous improvement of the app. This novel contribution will provide an evidence-based exemplar for future app development in the space of social isolation and loneliness. © Edward Meinert.

AB  - Virtual Coaches, also known as e-coaches, are a disruptive technology in healthcare. Indeed, among other usages, they might provide cost-effective solutions for increasing human wellbeing in different domains, such as physical, nutritional, cognitive, social, and emotional. This paper presents a systematic review of virtual coaches specifically aimed at improving or maintaining older adults' health in the aforementioned domains. Such digital systems assume various forms, from classic apps, to more advanced conversational agents or robots. Fifty-six articles describing a virtual coach for older adults and aimed at improving their wellbeing were identified and further analyzed. In particular, we presented how previous studies defined their virtual coaches, which behavioral change models and techniques they adopted and the overall system architecture, in terms of monitoring solutions, processing methods and modalities for intervention delivery. Our results show that few thorough evaluations of e-coaching systems have been conducted, especially regarding multi-domain coaching approaches. Through our analysis, we identified the wellbeing domains that should be addressed in future studies as well as the most promising behavior change models and techniques and coaching interfaces. Previous work illustrates that older adults often appreciate conversational agents and robots. However, the lack of a multidomain intervention approach in the current literature motivates us to seek to define future solutions. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Propaganda campaigns aim at influencing people's mindset with the purpose of advancing a specific agenda. They exploit the anonymity of the Internet, the micro-profiling ability of social networks, and the ease of automatically creating and managing coordinated networks of accounts, to reach millions of social network users with persuasive messages, specifically targeted to topics each individual user is sensitive to, and ultimately influencing the outcome on a targeted issue. In this survey, we review the state of the art on computational propaganda detection from the perspective of Natural Language Processing and Network Analysis, arguing about the need for combined efforts between these communities. We further discuss current challenges and future research directions. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade. All rights reserved.

AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are gaining interest to elicit user engagement and stimulate actual use of eHealth applications. In this literature review, we identify the researched design features for ECAs in eHealth, the outcome variables that were used to measure the effect of these design features and what the found effects for each variable were. Searches were performed in Scopus, ACM Digital Library, PsychINFO, Pubmed and IEEE Xplore Digital Library, resulting in 1284 identified articles of which 33 articles were included. The agents speech and/or textual output and its facial and gaze expressions were the most common design features. Little research was performed on the agent's looks. The measured effect of these design features was often on the perception of the agent's and user's characteristics, relation with the agent, system usage, intention to use, usability and behaviour change. Results show that emotion and relational behaviour seem to positively affect the perception of the agents characteristics and that relational behaviour also seems to positively affect the relation with the agent, usability and intention to use. However, these design features do not necessarily lead to behaviour change. This review showed that consensus on design features of ECAs in eHealth is far from established. Follow-up research should include more research on the effects of all design features, especially research on the effects in a long-term, daily life setting, and replication of studies on the effects of design features performed in other contexts than eHealth. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - The persuasive assistant study presented 72 participants with a persuasive to-do list application that was controlled via a spoken dialogue assistant. The investigated moderator variables were trait reactance, social agency, and involvement. Results show that trait reactance only moderated the effects of negative cognitions, while social agency interacts with both components of state reactance. No moderating effect of involvement could be shown. Furthermore, the study showed that state reactance can improve the prediction accuracy of the subjects’ global opinion about the technical device. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Robotics is a frontal interdisciplinary subject across the fields of mechanical engineering, chemical and materials engineering, artificial intelligence, and nanotechnology. Robotic devices with a variety of frameworks, functionalities, and actuation modes have been developed and employed in the manufacture of advanced materials and devices with improved efficiency and automation. In recent years, soft robots have attracted a significant amount of interest among scientific researchers and technological engineers because they can offer the desired safety, adaptability, sensibility, and dexterity that conventional robotics cannot deliver. To date, emulating living creatures in nature has been a promising approach to design soft robots. For living creatures, both body deformation and their surface characteristic are essential for them to function in dynamic ecological environments. Body deformation offers athletic ability while surface characteristics provide extraordinary adaptable interactions with the environment. In this article, we discuss the recent progress of emulating the body deformation of living creatures such as shrinking/expanding, bending, and twisting and programmable deformations based on the manipulation of shape-changing behaviors of liquid-crystal polymeric materials (LCPs) and the interfacial technologies to build up various microstructures similar to the interface of living creatures. We further review the pioneering work that integrates interfacial engineering and the shape-changing modulation of LCPs to develop biomimetic soft robotic devices. We also provide an outlook for opportunities and challenges in the design and fabrication of advanced biomimetic soft robots based on the synergetic combination of interfacial engineering and shape-changing odulation.

AB  - Technology is disrupting the practice of law and revolutionizing how lawyers work. This revolution is made more powerful because it is increasingly coupled with a rigorous and scientific approach to the law. In some ways, law is looking more like a Silicon Valley startup and less like the oak-paneled law firms of the last 200 years. As law, technology, and science merge, the implications for the profession are wide-sweeping. This article explores persuasive legal writing, offering new thoughts on what the future will hold. Specifically, this article pilots a method for applying technology and science to measure, analyze and improve persuasive legal writing, offering it as a proof of concept that anchors the article's broader, and perhaps more controversial assertion. Namely, more powerful and refined persuasive legal writing software tools, fueled by artificial intelligence, should and will disrupt and reshape significant portions of the legal space, including how legal writing is taught and how it is produced. The effect will be to view legal writing as more science, and less art. The next set of luminaries won't rely on anecdote or intuition to teach or create legal writing; they will rely on software and data. © 2020 Asociacion Nacional de Universidades e Instituciones de Educacion Superior A.C.

AB  - The integration of communication, navigation, sensing and services (CONANSENSE) has allowed the development of disruptive and influential technologies that increase at exponential speed and route the business disruptions, business models (BM) and even ecosystems of business models (BMES) everyday. As in a current scenario everyone is working hard to create smart and good ecological free organizations, Green business plays a crucial job for integrating corporate environmental management into the HRM. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an upcoming field in human resource technology that can improve the efficiency of human resource management processes. Therefore, application of AI plays an important role in corporate environmental management into HRM for Green business that was proposed in this paper. This paper deals with the exponential development of artificial intelligence technologies, which can replace or improve the efficiency of Green Business HRM processes with persuasive BM technologies for business model innovations and introduce a conceptual model for future innovations and functioning of the business model. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - Concussion, also referred to as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the most common type of traumatic brain injury. Currently concussion is an area of intense scientific interest to better understand the biological mechanisms and for biomarker development. We evaluated whole genome-wide blood DNA cytosine (‘CpG’) methylation in 17 pediatric concussion isolated cases and 18 unaffected controls using Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC assay. Pathway analysis was performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis to help elucidate the epigenetic and molecular mechanisms of the disorder. Area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUC) curves and FDR p-values were calculated for mTBI detection based on CpG methylation levels. Multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) platforms including Deep Learning (DL), the newest form of AI, were used to predict concussion based on i) CpG methylation markers alone, and ii) combined epigenetic, clinical and demographic predictors. We found 449 CpG sites (473 genes), those were statistically significantly methylated in mTBI compared to controls. There were four CpGs with excellent individual accuracy (AUC ≥ 0.90–1.00) while 119 displayed good accuracy (AUC ≥ 0.80–0.89) for the prediction of mTBI. The CpG methylation changes ≥10% were observed in many CpG loci after concussion suggesting biological significance. Pathway analysis identified several biologically important neurological pathways that were perturbed including those associated with: impaired brain function, cognition, memory, neurotransmission, intellectual disability and behavioral change and associated disorders. The combination of epigenomic and clinical predictors were highly accurate for the detection of concusion using AI techniques. Using DL/AI, a combination of epigenomic and clinical markers had sensitivity and specificity ≧95% for prediction of mTBI. In this novel study, we identified significant methylation changes in multiple genes in response to mTBI. Gene pathways that were epigenetically dysregulated included several known to be involved in neurological function, thus giving biological plausibility to our findings. © 2019

AB  - Violence detection is a challenging task in the computer vision domain. Violence detection framework depends upon the detection of crowd behaviour changes. Violence erupts due to disagreement of an idea, injustice or severe disagreement. The aim of any country is to maintain law and order and peace in the area. Violence detection thus becomes an important task for authorities to maintain peace. Traditional methods have existed for violence detection which are heavily dependent upon hand crafted features. The world is now transitioning in to Artificial Intelligence based techniques. Automatic feature extraction and its classification from images and videos is the new norm in surveillance domain. Deep learning platform has provided us the platter on which non-linear features can be extracted, self-learnt and classified as per the appropriate tool. One such tool is the Convolutional Neural Networks, also known as ConvNets, which has the ability to automatically extract features and classify them in to their respective domain. Till date there is no survey of deciphering violence behaviour techniques using ConvNets. We hope that this survey becomes an exclusive baseline for future violence detection and analysis in the deep learning domain. © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Radiology is experiencing an increased interest in machine learning with its ability to use a large amount of available data. However, it remains unclear how and to what extent machine learning will affect radiology businesses. Conducting a systematic literature review and expert interviews, we compile the opportunities and challenges of machine learning along the radiology value chain to discuss their implications for the radiology business. Machine learning can improve diagnostic quality by reducing human errors, accurately analysing large amounts of data, quantifying reports, and integrating data. Hence, it strengthens radiology businesses seeking product or service leadership. Machine learning fosters efficiency by automating accompanying activities such as generating study protocols or reports, avoiding duplicate work due to low image quality, and supporting radiologists. These efficiency improvements advance the operational excellence strategy. By providing personnel and proactive medical solutions beyond the radiology silo, machine learning supports a customer intimacy strategy. However, the opportunities face challenges that are technical (i.e., lack of data, weak labelling, and generalisation), legal (i.e., regulatory approval and privacy laws), and persuasive (i.e., radiologists' resistance and patients' distrust). Our findings shed light on the strategic positioning of radiology businesses, contributing to academic discourse and practical decision-making. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

AB  - Developing intelligent persuasive conversational agents to change people's opinions and actions for social good is the frontier in advancing the ethical development of automated dialogue systems. To do so, the first step is to understand the intricate organization of strategic disclosures and appeals employed in human persuasion conversations. We designed an online persuasion task where one participant was asked to persuade the other to donate to a specific charity. We collected a large dataset with 1,017 dialogues and annotated emerging persuasion strategies from a subset. Based on the annotation, we built a baseline classifier with context information and sentence-level features to predict the 10 persuasion strategies used in the corpus. Furthermore, to develop an understanding of personalized persuasion processes, we analyzed the relationships between individuals' demographic and psychological backgrounds including personality, morality, value systems, and their willingness for donation. Then, we analyzed which types of persuasion strategies led to a greater amount of donation depending on the individuals' personal backgrounds. This work lays the ground for developing a personalized persuasive dialogue system. 1. © 2019 Association for Computational Linguistics

AB  - Engaging in positive healthy lifestyle behaviors continues to be a public health challenge, requiring innovative solutions. As the market for voice assistants (Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri) grows and people increasingly use them to assist their daily tasks, there is a pressing need to explore how voice assistant (VA) technology may be used in behavioral health interventions. A scoping review of literature was conducted to address a PICO (Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome) question: across populations, how does the use of voice assistants in behavioral health research/ interventions influence healthy lifestyle behaviors versus control or comparison interventions? To inform the science, a secondary aim of this review was to explore characteristics of VAs used in behavioral health research. The review was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis guidelines with scoping review extension (PRISMA-ScR). Ten studies satisfied the inclusion criteria, representing research published through February 2019. Studies spanned pediatric to elderly populations, covering a vast array of self-management and healthy lifestyle behaviors. The majority of interventions were multicomponent, involving more than one of the following behavior change techniques grouped by cluster: shaping knowledge, self-belief, repetition and substitution, feedback and monitoring, goals and planning, antecedents, natural consequences, comparison of behavior, and identification. However, most studies were in early stages of development, with limited efficacy trials. VA technology continues to evolve and support behavioral interventions using various platforms (e.g., Interactive Voice Response [IVR] systems, smartphones, and smart speakers) which are used alone or in conjunction with other platforms. Feasibility, usability, preliminary efficacy, along with high user satisfaction of research adapted VAs, in contrast to standalone commercially available VAs, suggest a role for VAs in behavioral health intervention research.  © 2020 Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - Background: Smoking cessation is a persistent leading public health challenge. Mobile health (mHealth) solutions are emerging to improve smoking cessation treatments. Previous approaches have proposed supporting cessation with tailored motivational messages. Some managed to provide short-term improvements in smoking cessation. Yet, these approaches were either static in terms of personalization or human-based nonscalable solutions. Additionally, long-term effects were neither presented nor assessed in combination with existing psychopharmacological therapies. Objective: This study aimed to analyze the long-term efficacy of a mobile app supporting psychopharmacological therapy for smoking cessation and complementarily assess the involved innovative technology. Methods: A 12-month, randomized, open-label, parallel-group trial comparing smoking cessation rates was performed at Virgen del Rocío University Hospital in Seville (Spain). Smokers were randomly allocated to a control group (CG) receiving usual care (psychopharmacological treatment, n=120) or an intervention group (IG) receiving psychopharmacological treatment and using a mobile app providing artificial intelligence–generated and tailored smoking cessation support messages (n=120). The secondary objectives were to analyze health-related quality of life and monitor healthy lifestyle and physical exercise habits. Safety was assessed according to the presence of adverse events related to the pharmacological therapy. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses were performed. Incomplete data and multinomial regression analyses were performed to assess the variables influencing participant cessation probability. The technical solution was assessed according to the precision of the tailored motivational smoking cessation messages and user engagement. Cessation and no cessation subgroups were compared using t tests. A voluntary satisfaction questionnaire was administered at the end of the intervention to all participants who completed the trial. Results: In the IG, abstinence was 2.75 times higher (adjusted OR 3.45, P=.01) in the per-protocol analysis and 2.15 times higher (adjusted OR 3.13, P=.002) in the intention-to-treat analysis. Lost data analysis and multinomial logistic models showed different patterns in participants who dropped out. Regarding safety, 14 of 120 (11.7%) IG participants and 13 of 120 (10.8%) CG participants had 19 and 23 adverse events, respectively (P=.84). None of the clinical secondary objective measures showed relevant differences between the groups. The system was able to learn and tailor messages for improved effectiveness in supporting smoking cessation but was unable to reduce the time between a message being sent and opened. In either case, there was no relevant difference between the cessation and no cessation subgroups. However, a significant difference was found in system engagement at 6 months (P=.04) but not in all subsequent months. High system appreciation was reported at the end of the study. Conclusions: The proposed mHealth solution complementing psychopharmacological therapy showed greater efficacy for achieving 1-year tobacco abstinence as compared with psychopharmacological therapy alone. It provides a basis for artificial intelligence–based future approaches. © Laura Carrasco-Hernandez, Francisco Jódar-Sánchez, Francisco Núñez-Benjumea, Jesús Moreno Conde, Marco Mesa González, Antón Civit-Balcells, Santiago Hors-Fraile, Carlos Luis Parra-Calderón, Panagiotis D Bamidis, Francisco Ortega-Ruiz.

AB  - We apply Ant Colony Optimization concepts to the problem of finding appropriate reward values after successful task completion in serious games. Our algorithm is deployed within the InLife platform, which leverages the power of serious games augmented with real-world IOT sensors for educational purposes. The platform is deployed on four actual pilot sites in Spain, France and Greece with two distinct applications: teaching sustainable behavior to university students and improving social interaction skills for autistic children. In a decentralized, swarm intelligence fashion and based on individually released success and failure pheromones, our generic reward computation strategy seeks, by adjusting reward amounts on the fly, to achieve maximum efficiency in catalyzing behavior change while balancing adaptivity, parsimony, fairness and variety. On top of the necessarily limited real-world data, large-scale numerical validation of the algorithm is obtained with a specifically designed simulator, whose underlying cognitive model was validated by a clinical psychologist. Conducted experiments confirm the relevance and adaptive nature of the obtained pheromone map: the system automatically adjusts to changes in the environment such as the introduction of new students or pedagogical items. Experiments also validate all aforementioned desired characteristics and show substantial quantitative performance gains with respect to a static reward scheme in behavior change metrics, speed and success rates, of up to 40 percent with equal reward budget.

AB  - Emotion is a complex emotional state, which can affect our physiology and psychology and lead to behavior changes. The spreading process of emotions in the text-based social networks is referred to as sentiment spreading. In this paper, we study an interesting problem of sentiment spreading in social networks. In particular, by employing a text-based social network (Twitter), we try to unveil the correlation between users’ sentimental statuses and topic distributions embedded in the tweets, then to automatically learn the influence strength between linked users. Furthermore, we introduce user interest to refine the influence strength. We develop a unified probabilistic framework to formalize the problem into a topic-enhanced sentiment spreading model. The model can predict users’ sentimental statuses based on their historical emotional status, topic distributions in tweets and social structures. Experiments on the Twitter dataset show that the proposed model significantly outperforms several alternative methods in predicting users’ sentimental status. We also discover an intriguing phenomenon that positive and negative sentiment is more relevant to user interest than neutral ones. Our method offers a new opportunity to understand the underlying mechanism of sentimental spreading in online social networks.

AB  - With the rise of the Internet environment, automatic negotiation has become a research hotspot in the field of artificial intelligence. Especially in the complex negotiation environment, Agent has made the negotiation process more efficient because of its unique intelligence and interaction, and persuasive negotiation takes full consideration of persuasion factors and makes full use of persuasion, making the negotiation process more rational. Because emotion affects human cognition, goal and behavior, it plays an important role in human decision-making process. Therefore, emotion is an integral part of the field of artificial intelligence. Emotion is introduced into the field of Agent persuasion. By constructing emotional Agent, the intelligence and adaptability of Agent are improved and agent persuasion behavior is made. It is more consistent with human behavior, which has become the consensus of scholars. In the related research, the scholars and experts in this field have studied the persuasion based on Agent and the construction of emotional Agent from different angles, but there are the following problems: 1. the research on emotion is not comprehensive, especially the study of emotion calculation; 2. the research on the application of emotional theory to the Agent persuasion field is less; 3. to Agent More research is on the protocol mechanism, less research on the process of persuasion, especially the influence of emotion on the Agent persuasion process. In order to solve these problems effectively, this paper takes emotion as an important factor in the process of Agent persuasion, and focuses on Agent’s emotional persuasion decision-making process. First, the formal model based on the Agent emotional persuasion decision process is defined. Then the emotional persuasion decision-making process is defined and divided. The emotional persuasion decision process based on Agent is divided into four stages: the evaluation of emotional persuasion, the renewal of emotional persuasion, the adjustment of the emotional persuasion target, and the emotional persuasion. Secondly, through the influence of Agent’s personality on emotional trigger threshold, the emotion desalination factor is introduced, Agent emotional trigger function is defined, and the renewal emotion is built in the persuasion state model. Again, the mapping relationship between eight basic emotions and targets is established by defining emotional evaluation factors, and the emotional persuasion target model is constructed. In the end, the emotional persuasion behavior is divided into four categories: incentive emotional persuasion, pleading emotional persuasion, threatening emotional persuasion and antiplea emotional persuasion, and setting up the principle of emotional persuasion and target matching, and constructing emotional persuasion behavior model. Finally, a complete emotional persuasion decision-making process is formed, and the rationality and validity of the model is proved by an example. To illustrate the above decision process and the effectiveness of the model, an example is designed and analyzed. The example shows that emotional persuasion plays an important role in the decision-making process of Agent and the generation of emotional persuasion. If Agent evaluates the current persuasion to produce happy, dependent, relaxed, gentle, and so on, the emotion that has positive pleasure will encourage Agent to generate incentive or plea emotional persuasion. On the contrary, the feelings of negative pleasure, such as hostility, disdain, boredom, and anxiety, may cause Agent to defer or plead. Type of emotional persuasion. Based on this, the validity of the model is verified, and the important influence of emotion on persuasion decision process is also illustrated. © 2020

AB  - Although more individuals are relying on information provided by nonhuman agents, such as artificial intelligence and robots, little research has examined how persuasion attempts made by nonhuman agents might differ from persuasion attempts made by human agents. Drawing on construal-level theory, we posited that individuals would perceive artificial agents at a low level of construal because of the agents’ lack of autonomous goals and intentions, which directs individuals’ focus toward how these agents implement actions to serve humans rather than why they do so. Across multiple studies (total N = 1,668), we showed that these construal-based differences affect compliance with persuasive messages made by artificial agents. These messages are more appropriate and effective when the message represents low-level as opposed to high-level construal features. These effects were moderated by the extent to which an artificial agent could independently learn from its environment, given that learning defies people’s lay theories about artificial agents. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: Across the globe, managing chronic diseases has been recognized as a challenge for patients and healthcare providers. The state of the art in managing chronic conditions requires not only responding to the clinical needs of the patient, but also guaranteeing a comfortable state of wellbeing for them, despite living with the disease. This demands mutual effort between the patient and the physician in constantly collecting data, monitoring, and understanding the disease. The advent of artificial intelligence has made this process easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to analyze how the different artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are used to manage different types of chronic conditions. Objective: Throughout this grounded theory literature review, we aim to provide an overview for the features that characterize artificial intelligence based health coaching systems used by patients with chronic diseases. Methods: During our search and paper selection process process, we use three bibliographic libraries (PubMed, IEEE Xplore, and ACM Digital Library). Using the grounded theory, we extract overarching themes for the artificial intelligence based health coaching systems. These systems are then classified according to their role, platform, type of interaction with the patient, as well as targeted chronic conditions. Of 869 citations retrieved, 31 unique studies are included in this review. Results: The included studies assess 14 different chronic conditions. Common roles for AI-based health coaching systems are: developing adherence, informing, motivating, reminding, preventing, building a care network, and entertaining. Health coaching systems combine the aforementioned roles to cater to the needs of the patients. The combinations of these roles differ between multilateral, unilateral, opposing bilateral, complementing bilateral, one-role-missing, and the blurred role combinations. Conclusion: Clinical solutions and research related to artificial intelligence based health coaching systems are very limited. Clear guidelines to help develop artificial intelligence-based health coaching systems are still blurred. This grounded theory literature review attempted to shed the light on the research and development requirements for an effective health coaching system intended for patients with chronic conditions. Researchers are recommended to use this review to identify the most suitable role combination for an effective health coaching system development. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - We study an information-structure design problem (i.e., a Bayesian persuasion problem) in an online scenario. Inspired by the classic gambler's problem, consider a set of candidates who arrive sequentially and are evaluated by one agent (the sender). This agent learns the value from hiring the candidate to herself as well as the value to another agent, the receiver. The sender provides a signal to the receiver who, in turn, makes an irrevocable decision on whether or not to hire the candidate. A-priori, for each agent the distribution of valuation is independent across candidates but may not be identical. We design good online signaling schemes for the sender. To assess the performance, we compare the expected utility to that of an optimal offline scheme by a prophet sender who knows all candidate realizations in advance. We show an optimal prophet inequality for online Bayesian persuasion, with a 1/2-approximation when the instance satisfies a “satisfactory-status-quo” assumption. Without this assumption, there are instances without any finite approximation factor. We extend the results to combinatorial domains and obtain prophet inequalities for matching with multiple hires and multiple receivers. © 2020 Inst. Sci. inf., Univ. Defence in Belgrade.

AB  - The challenge of changing user cybersecurity behaviour is now in the foreground of cybersecurity research. To understand the problem, cybersecurity behaviour researchers have included, into their studies, theories from the Psychology domain. Psychology makes use of several behavioural theories to explain behaviour. This leads to the question, which of these theories are best suited to firstly understand cybersecurity behaviour and secondly to change the behaviour for the better. To answer this question, as a prelude to the current paper, previous publications have 1) established a definition for the different categories of cybersecurity behaviour, 2) identified and applied a framework, the Theoretical Domains Framework, that ties different behavioural theories together into one behaviour change framework. The current study is aimed to show the link between the behavioural constructs discussed in the Theoretical Domains Framework to the different cybersecurity behaviour categories. The contribution of the study is towards the implementors of initiatives that aim to change cybersecurity behaviour. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Purpose of conference: On January 18, 2020, the Nephrology is Back learning day forum was held in Toronto, ON, Canada. The objectives of the meeting were to describe recent advances in nephrology for community and academic nephrologists and patients, and to define challenges and opportunities for integration of new data into clinical practice. The intent was to test a unique forum for continuing medical education integrating physician and patient experiences with the goal of encouraging change in practice. Sources of information: Program content was based on current literature and clinical experience. Additional information was provided by patient partners who attended the meeting to provide their perspective on current issues in nephrology. Methods: A steering committee (A.L., A.S., and D.S.) developed goals and an outline for the content to be covered over the course of the meeting and led the recruitment of speakers. Speakers were asked to develop their presentations independently following direction by the committee, based on primary sources, including their own experiences. Presentations were followed by discussion including both physicians and patients, and participants had an opportunity to evaluate the conference and its outcomes. Key findings: We present a unique approach to providing continuing medical education by including both physicians and patients in the learning process. Patient perspectives accompanying presentations around data and other clinical topics provided a much different environment from other knowledge translation exercises. We believe this represents an innovative approach for knowledge translation that allows physicians to address clinical topics in a novel manner, including the integration of new findings into practice and the need to cascade this education to their peers. Limitations: Because the conference was a one-time event, it has been difficult to assess the actual clinical impact of the knowledge translation exercise and whether physician behaviors have changed as a result of the activity. The conference could also have included broader representation from across Canada. Implications: The success of this test forum among both physicians and patient partners suggests that the inclusion of patient partners in learning could have an important role in future educational initiatives. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The use of sex robots is expected to become widespread in the coming decades, not only for hedonistic purposes but also for therapy, to keep the elderly company in care homes, for education, and to help couples in longdistance relationships. As new technological artifacts are introduced to society, they play a role in shaping the societal norms and belief systems while also creating tensions between various approaches and relationships, resulting in a range of policy-making proposals that bring into question traditional disciplinary boundaries that exist between the technical and the social. The Narrative Policy Framework attempts to position policy studies in such a way so as to better describe, explain, and predict a wide variety of processes and outcomes in a political world increasingly burdened by uncertain reporting, capitalistic marketing, and persuasive narratives. Through content analysis, this study identifies coalitions in the scientific community, based on results gathered from Scopus, to develop insights into the manner in which liberal, utilitarian, and conservative influences alike are shaping narrative elements and content both in favor of and against sex robot technology. © 2020 De Gruyter.

AB  - Background: Embodied conversational agents (ECAs) are animated computer characters that simulate face-to-face counseling. Owing to their capacity to establish and maintain an empathic relationship, they are deemed to be a promising tool for starting and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Objective: This review aimed to identify the current practices in designing and evaluating ECAs for coaching people in a healthy lifestyle and provide an overview of their efficacy (on behavioral, knowledge, and motivational parameters) and use (on usability, usage, and user satisfaction parameters). Methods: We used the Arksey and O'Malley framework to conduct a scoping review. PsycINFO, Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, and Scopus were searched with a combination of terms related to ECA and lifestyle. Initially, 1789 unique studies were identified; 20 studies were included. Results: Most often, ECAs targeted physical activity (n=16) and had the appearance of a middle-aged African American woman (n=13). Multiple behavior change techniques (median=3) and theories or principles (median=3) were applied, but their interpretation and application were usually not reported. ECAs seemed to be designed for the end user rather than with the end user. Stakeholders were usually not involved. A total of 7 out of 15 studies reported better efficacy outcomes for the intervention group, and 5 out of 8 studies reported better use-related outcomes, as compared with the control group. Conclusions: ECAs are a promising tool for persuasive communication in the health domain. This review provided valuable insights into the current developmental processes, and it recommends the use of human-centered, stakeholder-inclusive design approaches, along with reporting on the design activities in a systematic and comprehensive manner. The gaps in knowledge were identified on the working mechanisms of intervention components and the right timing and frequency of coaching. © 2020 Lean L Kramer, Silke ter Stal, Bob C Mulder, Emely de Vet, Lex van Velsen.

AB  - Structural hole spanners play an important role in information diffusion. Compared with opinion leaders, structural hole spanners have better locations in social networks to expand the scope of information diffusion. In the past, researchers focused on evolution rules and opinion dynamics environments to monitor and even manage public opinion. In this study, we propose a novel structural-hole-based approach to control public opinion in social networks, hereinafter referred to as the SHCPO approach. We discuss the influence of both ordinary agents and structural hole spanners on opinion evolution using our improved Friedkin–Johnsen (FJ) model. Further, we analyze the evolution tendency of public opinion, which leads to the final consensus of public opinion, via the FJ model with ordinary agents in a community and structural hole spanners in joint communities. We reveal three kinds of connections between structural hole spanners and ordinary agents in joint communities. These comprise structural hole spanners connecting (1) two opinion leaders; (2) two ordinary agents; (3) one opinion leader and one ordinary agent. The three connections will lead to different opinion evolution conditions. According to the structural balance theory, we reconstruct the social network by changing the connections between structural hole spanners and agents in different communities. This guides the public opinion tendencies of joint communities towards the positive. Experimental results demonstrate beneficial effects of the SHCPO approach. We use three evaluation indicators to compare the SHCPO approach to five alternative methods. The percentage of positive opinions is used as an evaluation indicator. The SHCPO approach, compared with adding informed agents, add edges, the method from WWW and varying susceptibility to persuasion method, which guide the agent with a negative opinion towards positive opinion, has improved about 17%, 10%, 9%, 1%, respectively. © 2020

AB  - In the big data environment, the personalized recommender system based on offline batch processing has the advantages of accurate calculation and high fault tolerance. However, due to its large amount of calculation, it cannot satisfy the real-time requirement. At present, the real-time recommender system architecture based on the combination of offline layer and online layer also has some disadvantages in summarizing results and maintaining updates, and the recommended result depends on the offline layer. If the user behavior changes in a short time and the result update of the offline layer is lagging, the final recommendation will not reflect the user’s interest change very well. Aiming at these problems, this paper makes use of the Spark Streaming micro-batch data stream processing function to implement a real-time recommendation system. The system realized a real-time recommendation composed entirely of online stream computing based on the consistency of the user positive and negative evaluation of the item.Considering the problem of unstable data flow in the actual application scenario, the message queue Kafka is introduced to ensure the smooth and stable real-time data inflow speed. Finally, the performance of the entire system and the effectiveness of the recommendation are verified by Movielens data set. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Human consumption behavior was believed to be the primary reason for the exhaustion of natural resources resulting in undesirable destruction to the environment. Every person is aware of environmental issues, hence, consciously, environmental issues are already objects of the mind. What is lacking then is the behavioral preference for activities and practices that would lead to green consumption. This study takes an important step towards exploring messaging and conversation technologies using chatbots, to behaviorally influence the preferential consciousness of people towards green consumption. Significant topics to transform people from non-green to green food consumption behavior were explored from philosophical and ecological perspectives. To guide the fundamental design of a change agent, behavioral theories and motivation techniques were studied and subsequently integrated to develop a new behavior change agent framework. To validate the technical feasibility of the framework's design principles, theoretical underpinnings, and procedures, a functionality review of chatbot development platforms was conducted. The features provided by SnatchBot platform proved that it is possible to use chatbot as a tool to bring about behavioral change. We contribute a valuable framework that can be adapted in the design of conversational agents aimed at improving one’s well-being through the adoption of green food consumption to help effectively address the challenges presented by climate change and declining natural resource availability. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

AB  - There is increasing evidence that indicates how personalising persuasive strategies may increase the effectiveness of persuasive technologies and behaviour change interventions. This has led to a wide range of studies exploring self reported, perceived susceptibility to persuasion, which highlight the role of individual differences. Conducting such studies, while accounting for individual differences can be challenging, particularly where persuasive strategies may be considered similar due to their underlying components. In this paper, we present a study exploring perceived susceptibility to Cialdini’s principles of persuasion, with a focus on how we can distinguish perceived susceptibility measures between the most recently identified Unity principle and Social proof. This study was conducted using an online survey incorporating perceived susceptibility measures to all seven Cialdini principles and a measure of the actual effectiveness of seven corresponding persuasive strategies. Our results indicate that while we are able to distinguish perceived susceptibility measures between Unity and Social proof, together with Commitment, Scarcity and Reciprocity, we were unable to obtain these measures for Liking and Authority. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - While majority of previous research focus on reviewing mobile health (mHealth) apps targeting specific health domain, this paper provides a comparative systematic review of mHealth apps across multiple health domains with the aim of deconstructing the persuasive strategies employed and their implementation. Specifically, we targeted four health domains (i.e., physical activity and fitness, diet, emotional and mental health, and health assessment and healthcare). We retrieved a total of 639 apps from Google Play out of which 80 popular apps were extracted (20 apps in each category). Three expert reviewers coded the apps using 32 persuasive strategies (PSs) based on Persuasive System Design (PSD) Model and Cialdini’s Principles of Persuasion. Overall, out of the 80 mHealth apps reviewed, personalization is the most commonly employed PS (n = 77), followed by surface credibility (n = 69), trustworthiness (n = 66) and self-monitoring (n = 64). How the apps are implemented varies depending on the domain. Based on our findings, we offer suggestions for designing mHealth apps to improve their persuasiveness. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is emerging as a persuasive tool in the field of medical science. This research work also primarily focuses on the development of a tool to automate the diagnosis of inflammatory diseases of the knee joint. The tool will also assist the physicians and medical practitioners for diagnosis. The diseases considered for this research under inflammatory category are osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteonecrosis. A five-layer adaptive neuro-fuzzy (ANFIS) architecture was used to model the system. The ANFIS system works by mapping input parameters to the input membership functions, input membership functions are mapped to the rules generated by the ANFIS model which are further mapped to the output membership function. A comparative performance analysis of fuzzy system and ANFIS system is also done and results generated shows that the ANFIS system outperformed fuzzy system in terms of testing accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.

AB  - End-to-end task-oriented dialog models have achieved promising performance on collaborative tasks where users willingly coordinate with the system to complete a given task. While in non-collaborative settings, for example, negotiation and persuasion, users and systems do not share a common goal. As a result, compared to collaborate tasks, people use social content to build rapport and trust in these non-collaborative settings in order to advance their goals. To handle social content, we introduce a hierarchical intent annotation scheme, which can be generalized to different non-collaborative dialog tasks. Building upon TransferTransfo (Wolf et al. 2019), we propose an end-to-end neural network model to generate diverse coherent responses. Our model utilizes intent and semantic slots as the intermediate sentence representation to guide the generation process. In addition, we design a filter to select appropriate responses based on whether these intermediate representations fit the designed task and conversation constraints. Our non-collaborative dialog model guides users to complete the task while simultaneously keeps them engaged. We test our approach on our newly proposed ANTISCAM dataset and an existing PERSUASIONFORGOOD dataset. Both automatic and human evaluations suggest that our model outperforms multiple baselines in these two non-collaborative tasks.

AB  - Replicability tests of scientific papers show that the majority of papers fail replication. Moreover, failed papers circulate through the literature as quickly as replicating papers. This dynamic weakens the literature, raises research costs, and demonstrates the need for new approaches for estimating a study's replicability. Here, we trained an artificial intelligence model to estimate a paper's replicability using ground truth data on studies that had passed or failed manual replication tests, and then tested the model's generalizability on an extensive set of out-of-sample studies. The model predicts replicability better than the base rate of reviewers and comparably as well as prediction markets, the best present-day method for predicting replicability. In out-of-sample tests on manually replicated papers from diverse disciplines and methods, the model had strong accuracy levels of 0.65 to 0.78. Exploring the reasons behind the model's predictions, we found no evidence for bias based on topics, journals, disciplines, base rates of failure, persuasion words, or novelty words like “remarkable” or “unexpected.” We did find that the model's accuracy is higher when trained on a paper's text rather than its reported statistics and that n-grams, higher order word combinations that humans have difficulty processing, correlate with replication. We discuss how combining human and machine intelligence can raise confidence in research, provide research self-assessment techniques, and create methods that are scalable and efficient enough to review the ever-growing numbers of publications-a task that entails extensive human resources to accomplish with prediction markets and manual replication alone. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Data-driven technologies can persuade humans to optimize their behavior and context based on objective data. However, current data-driven technologies have limited persuasive powers, because of a misfit between technology, end-users and context. Neglecting end-users in the development process contributes to this misfit and to limited engagement with the to-be-developed technology. This threatens sustainable (long-term) implementation. Therefore, this paper demonstrates how a bottom-up participatory development approach can improve the persuasive design of data-driven technologies and simultaneously increase engagement of end-users to foster sustainable implementation. This is done by describing part of the development of an Audit & Feedback system for healthcare workers at a Dutch regional general hospital. The system intends to contribute to reducing antimicrobial resistance. The rationale for, questions asked at and results of a questionnaire and two focus groups are described. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Rhetorical arguments are used in negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to persuade his opponent to accept a proposal more readily. When more than one argument is generated, the proponent must compare them in order to select the most adequate for his interests. A way of comparing them is by means of their strength values. Related articles propose a calculation based only on the components of the rhetorical arguments, i.e., the importance of the opponent’s goal and the certainty level of the beliefs that make up the argument. This article aims to propose a model for the measurement of the strength of rhetorical arguments, which is inspired on the pre-conditions of credibility and preferability stated by Guerini and Castelfranchi. Thus, we suggest the use of two new criteria to the strength calculation: the credibility of the proponent and the status of the opponent’s goal in the goal processing cycle. The model is empirically evaluated and the results demonstrate that the proposed model is more efficient than previous works of the state of the art in terms of number of exchanged arguments and number of reached agreements. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Using food recall data collected from over 8000 Americans, we used Machine Learning to classify a person’s demographic characteristics (age, gender, race, and income) based on the foods they consumed in a 24-h period. The best-performing models predicted gender correctly 61%, race 44%, and age 43% of the time on independent validation data. The model was subsequently used to provide tailored recommendations for healthier food options based on low-calorie and low-fat options for specific food groups that are typically consumed by other Americans that match the person’s demographics. This system is part of a larger Smart Human-Centered System that assists users in recording the foods they consume, recognizes nutritional content of the food, offers tailored recommendations for consuming healthier foods, and tracking behavior change over time. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Rendering transport behaviours more sustainable is a pressing issue of our times. In this paper, we rely on the deep penetration of mobile phones in order to influence citizens’ behavior through data-driven mobility and persuasive profiles. Our proposed approach aims to nudge users on a personalized level in order to change their mobility behavior and make more sustainable choices. To achieve our goal, first we leverage pervasive mobile sensing to uncover users’ mobility patterns and use of transportation modes. Second, we construct users’ persuadability profiles by considering their personality and mobility behavior. With the use of the aforementioned information we generate personalized interventions that nudge users to adopt sustainable transportation habits. These interventions rely on persuasive technologies and are embedded in a route planning application for smartphones. A pilot study with 30 participants using the system for 6 weeks provided fairly positive evaluation results in terms of the acceptance of our approach and revealed instances of behavioural change. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Ongoing pain is one of the most common diseases and has major physical, psychological, social, and economic impacts. A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC. Objective: The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated. Methods: Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data. Results: From May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4%) and men (14/102, 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants’ comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients’ own comments. Conclusions: SELMA is feasible, as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example, the participants’ intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg, with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA. © Sandra Hauser-Ulrich, Hansjörg Künzli, Danielle Meier-Peterhans, Tobias Kowatsch.

AB  - In China, where the driving environment is extremely complicated, lane-change scene occurs frequently and its impact is prominent. Analysis of lane changing driving behavior can not only provide a certain theoretical support for traffic managers, but also provide a reference basis for the development of advanced driver assistance systems. In view of the current Chinese research gaps in the model of lane-change duration, this article focuses on the lane-change duration. Firstly, using mathematical statistics to describe the general situation of lane changing behavior characteristics in common driving scenarios; then using simple univariate linear regression method to analyze the relationship between each parameter and the lane changing duration; and then, establishing a multivariate linear regression model including all independent variables, and use forward stepwise regression to screen the model parameters. There is a certain degree of improvement after the model is optimized to acquire higher determination coefficient, the overall linear significance, and the significance level of some variables. Finally, the sklearn library in python is called to train, tune and evaluate the model. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effects of an anti-bullying activity that utilizes conversational virtual agents (called conversation-bots or chatbots) on students’ attitudes toward bullying problems. An experimental pre- or posttest design with a three-group setting was used. Eighty-nine fifth-grade students were assigned to one of three groups: Conversation with a virtual agent of (a) bully’s role, (b) victim’s role, and (c) teacher’s role. All agents are conversation-bots designed to support learner–computer interactions. The bully agent defends the notion that bullying behaviors are acceptable whereas the victim agent argues that bullying behavior cannot be tolerated. The teacher agent teaches students the types of bullying and its negative aspects. The participants completed an anti-bullying attitude test at pre- and posttest, which included students’ anti-bully, intention, pro-victim, behavior, and self-efficacy factors. The results show that students’ attitudes toward bullying problems changed to more positive responses after the implementation that used the conversation-bot. In addition, the results revealed that the agent’s role had an impact on the students’ attitudes toward the anti-bully factor. Implications and future research regarding the use of conversation-bots in education are discussed. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - It is often a clinical challenge to perform a differential diagnosis of individual patients suffering from CVDs and respiratory diseases, as their causes can be coincidental, their symptoms may overlap and case definitions are often not straightforward. They are often under-or misdiagnosed and co-occur in ageing individuals with multiple comorbidities. Similar or even greater problems occur when establishing their population epidemiology. Furthermore, as global diagnostic practices and medical access are highly heterogeneous, comparing national and international epidemiology estimators is not easy. In this chapter, we aim to describe the current epidemiology and future burden of CVDs and respiratory diseases, as well as their occurrence as comorbidities. © ERS 2020.

AB  - Explainable AI aims at building intelligent systems that are able to provide a clear, and human understandable, justification of their decisions. This holds for both rule-based and data-driven methods. In management of chronic diseases, the users of such systems are patients that follow strict dietary rules to manage such diseases. After receiving the input of the intake food, the system performs reasoning to understand whether the users follow an unhealthy behavior. Successively, the system has to communicate the results in a clear and effective way, that is, the output message has to persuade users to follow the right dietary rules. In this paper, we address the main challenges to build such systems: (i) the Natural Language Generation of messages that explain the reasoner inconsistency; and, (ii) the effectiveness of such messages at persuading the users. Results prove that the persuasive explanations are able to reduce the unhealthy users’ behaviors. © 2020

AB  - For some problems, it is difficult for humans to judge the goodness of AI-proposed solutions. Irving, Christiano, and Amodei (2018) propose that in such cases, we may use a debate between two AI systems to assist the human judge to select a good answer. We introduce a mathematical framework for modelling this type of debate and propose that the quality of debate designs may be measured by the accuracy of the most persuasive answer. We describe a simple instance of the debate framework called feature debate and analyze the degree to which such debates track the truth. We argue that despite being very simple, feature debates capture many aspects of practical debates such as the incentives to confuse the judge or stall to prevent losing. We analyze two special types of debates, those where arguments constitute independent evidence about the topic, and those where the information bandwidth of the judge is limited. © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Purpose: “Technological intelligence” is the capacity to appreciate and adapt technological advancements, and “artificial intelligence” is the key to achieve persuasive operational transformations in majority of contemporary organizational set-ups. Implicitly, artificial intelligence (the philosophies of machines to think, behave and perform either same or similar to humans) has knocked the doors of business organizations as an imperative activity. Artificial intelligence, as a discipline, initiated by scientist John McCarthy and formally publicized at Dartmouth Conference in 1956, now occupies a central stage for many organizations. Implementation of artificial intelligence provides competitive edge to an organization with a definite augmentation in its social and corporate status. Mere application of a concept will not furnish real output until and unless its performance is reviewed systematically. Technological changes are dynamic and advancing at a rapid rate. Subsequently, it becomes highly crucial to understand that where have the people reached with respect to artificial intelligence research. The present article aims to review significant work by eminent researchers towards artificial intelligence in the form of top contributing universities, authors, keywords, funding sources, journals and citation statistics. Design/methodology/approach: As rightly remarked by past researchers that reviewing is learning from experience, research team has reviewed (by applying systematic literature review through bibliometric analysis) the concept of artificial intelligence in this article. A sum of 1,854 articles extracted from Scopus database for the year 2018–2019 (31st of May) with selected keywords (artificial intelligence, genetic algorithms, agent-based systems, expert systems, big data analytics and operations management) along with certain filters (subject–business, management and accounting; language-English; document–article, article in press, review articles and source-journals). Findings: Results obtained from cluster analysis focus on predominant themes for present as well as future researchers in the area of artificial intelligence. Emerged clusters include Cluster 1: Artificial Intelligence and Optimization; Cluster 2: Industrial Engineering/Research and Automation; Cluster 3: Operational Performance and Machine Learning; Cluster 4: Sustainable Supply Chains and Sustainable Development; Cluster 5: Technology Adoption and Green Supply Chain Management and Cluster 6: Internet of Things and Reverse Logistics. Originality/value: The result of review of selected studies is in itself a unique contribution and a food for thought for operations managers and policy makers. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The paper discusses the methods of modeling and assessing the quality of the argumentation used in popular science texts, as well as the software supporting them. First, the authors study the aspects of argumentation persuasiveness, i.e. the validity of conclusions presented in articles. Argumentation modeling is performed using the argumentation ontology based on the AIF format (Argument Interchange Format), which was adopted by the international community as a standard notation for describing arguments and argumentation schemes. The authors have supplemented this ontology with the facilities necessary for modeling and analyzing the quality of argumentation in popular science discourse. In particular, we have introduced into the ontology facilities allowing us to assign the estimates of persuasiveness (degree of the truth) to the arguments and statements and to model the target audience. Thanks to these facilities, it has become possible to analyze the persuasiveness of the argumentation regarding different target audiences. To solve this problem, the authors propose a model and an algorithm for calculating the persuasiveness of arguments allowing taking into account conflicts between the arguments. The paper also provides an example of constructing a network of arguments and calculating the degree of their persuasiveness using the software system developed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - We study an information-structure design problem (a.k.a. a persuasion problem) with a single sender and multiple receivers with actions of a priori unknown types, independently drawn from action-specific marginal probability distributions. As in the standard Bayesian persuasion model, the sender has access to additional information regarding the action types, which she can exploit when committing to a (noisy) signaling scheme through which she sends a private signal to each receiver. The novelty of our model is in considering the much more expressive case in which the receivers interact in a sequential game with imperfect information, with utilities depending on the game outcome and the realized action types. After formalizing the notions of ex ante and ex interim persuasiveness (which differ by the time at which the receivers commit to following the sender's signaling scheme), we investigate the continuous optimization problem of computing a signaling scheme which maximizes the sender's expected revenue. We show that computing an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme is NP-hard when there are three or more receivers. Instead, in contrast with previous hardness results for ex interim persuasion, we show that, for games with two receivers, an optimal ex ante persuasive signaling scheme can be computed in polynomial time thanks to the novel algorithm we propose, based on the ellipsoid method.

AB  - Over the last decades, argumentation has become increasingly central as a frontier research within artificial intelligence (AI), especially around the notions of interpretability and explainability, which are more and more required within AI applications. In this paper we present the first prototype of Arg-tuProlog, a logic-based argumentation tool built on top of the tuProlog system. In particular, Arg-tuProlog enables defeasible reasoning and argumentation, and deals with priorities over rules. It also includes a formal method for dealing with burden of proof (burden of persuasion). Being lightweight and compliant to the requirements for micro-intelligence, Arg-tuProlog is perfectly suited for injecting argumentation into distributed pervasive systems. © 2020 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Advertising to children and teenagers is a multibillion-dollar industry. This policy statement reviews the forms of advertising that children and teenagers encounter, including newer forms of digital marketing, such as sponsored content, influencers, data collection, persuasive design, and personalized behavioral marketing driven by machine learning. Parents and pediatric health care providers need to be aware of the ways different marketing messages reach children and teenagers, including Internet sites, social media, and mobile apps. Evidence suggests that exposure to advertising is associated with unhealthy behaviors, such as intake of high-calorie, low-nutrient food and beverages; use of tobacco products and electronic cigarettes; use of alcohol and marijuana; and indoor tanning. Children are uniquely vulnerable to the persuasive effects of advertising because of immature critical thinking skills and impulse inhibition. School-aged children and teenagers may be able to recognize advertising but often are not able to resist it when it is embedded within trusted social networks, encouraged by celebrity influencers, or delivered next to personalized content. This policy statement expresses concern about the practice of tracking and using children's digital behavior to inform targeted marketing campaigns, which may contribute to health disparities among vulnerable children or populations. Pediatricians should guide parents and children to develop digital literacy skills to prevent or mitigate negative outcomes, but it is equally important that policy makers and technology companies embrace digital design, data collection, and marketing practices within today's broad digital environment that support healthier decision-making and outcomes.

AB  - The literature provides evidence for the importance of non-verbal cues when it comes to persuading other people and developing persuasive robots. Mostly, people use these non-verbal cues subconsciously and, more importantly, are not aware of the subliminal impact of them. To raise awareness of subliminal persuasion and to explore a way for investigating persuasive cues for the development of persuasive robots and agents, we have analyzed videos of political public speeches and trained a neural network capable of predicting the degree of perceived convincingness based on visual input only. We then created visualizations of the predictions by making use of the explainable artificial intelligence methods Grad-CAM and layer-wise relevance propagation that highlight the most relevant image sections and markers. Our results show that the neural network learned to focus on the person, more specifically their posture and contours, as well as on their hands and face. These results are in line with existing literature and, thus, show the practical potential of our approach. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Throughout our lives, we are dealing with panic situations and often we are constrained to make crucial decisions in a limited delay. Especially in case of crowd evacuation; where human lives risk to be damaged or even ended following a disaster such as fire, explosions, and floods. These recent years, crowd modelling have been increasingly proposed. Unluckily, most of these models miss the consideration of victims' emotions. This paper propose a combined rational and emotional archi-tecture to simulate human behaviors in emergencies. Specifically, we focus on the dominant emotions and personality based on the OCEAN and the OCC models. Our aim is to show the influence of these models of the human behavior in crises. Our architecture contains also a metric module that computes the distance between an agent and the emergency exits, the outputs of this module affect the intensity of the agent's emotions and accordingly the agent's behavior. To make our simulation more realistic, we use Fuzzy Logic to model agent's behavior changes in emergency. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - This paper describes the design for a personal mental health virtual assistant with novel ambient intelligence integration - PerMEASS. It is specifically designed to provide help for three mental health issues: stress, anxiety and depression. Its assistance in these issues is based on two very closely related and trending multidisciplinary computer science fields - persuasive technology and digital behavior change intervention, which both research ways to affect human behavior or attitudes with technology, but without coercion or deception. A short overview of such assistants focuses on three of them, which represent state of the art. PerMEASS is described in more detail and compared to state of the art to showcase how it advances the existing solutions. The focus is on two parts of PerMEASS' cognitive architecture that present novel contributions: 1) a model of the theory of mind, a cognitive ability to understand other people and act appropriately, 2) an integration with ambient intelligence - artificial intelligence in the environment - in the form of a smart bracelet. PerMEASS' theory of mind is used to build a user model and utilize mental health and behavior change ontologies to devise effective and personalized strategies. At the same time, reinforcement learning is used to evaluate the strategies in real-time and use only the ones that are successful, making PerMEASS very adaptive. PerMEASS uses a smart bracelet to achieve this goal as well. The integration of the assistant with a device to collect biophysiological data in real-time pushes the assistant technology into new, so far unexplored directions. Our future work consists of firm implementation of the design and testing it in randomized controlled trials. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Conversational agents have been developed for supporting a wide array of areas, including autonomous vehicles, decision making, and health behavior change. In the last few years, conversational agents increasingly became available as everyday technologies. This phenomenon enables opportunities for finding novel ways to support health and wellness in everyday contexts. By conducting a content analysis of 433 user reviews of Amazon Alexa's Skills, the goal of this study is two-fold: (1) Extract users' perceived strengths of conversational agents in everyday health and wellness management, (2) develop design heuristics for developing conversational agents for health and wellness. We found that the role of trustworthy content providers is critical during the adoption. The Skills enabled people to overcome logistical barriers to improving daily health and wellness routines. The findings also revealed the importance of transparency in the limitations of the Skill and how to better design command dialogues. We present the design heuristics of conversational agents, building on Nielsen's Usability Heuristics, and discuss implications for designing conversational agents that support health and wellness.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Background: The Patient Experience Recommender System for Persuasive Communication Tailoring (PERSPeCT) is a machine learning recommender system with a database of messages to motivate smoking cessation. PERSPeCT uses the collective intelligence of users (ie, preferences and feedback) and demographic and smoking profiles to select motivating messages. PERSPeCT may be more beneficial for tailoring content to minority groups influenced by complex, personally relevant factors. Objective: The objective of this study was to describe and evaluate the use of PERSPeCT in African American people who smoke compared with white people who smoke. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental design, we compared African American people who smoke with a historical cohort of white people who smoke, who both received up to 30 emailed tailored messages over 65 days. People who smoke rated the daily message in terms of perceived influence on quitting smoking for 30 days. Our primary analysis compared daily message ratings between the two groups using a t test. We used a logistic model to compare 30-day cessation between the two groups and adjusted for covariates. Results: The study included 119 people who smoke (African Americans, 55/119; whites, 64/119). At baseline, African American people who smoke were significantly more likely to report allowing smoking in the home (P=.002); all other characteristics were not significantly different between groups. Daily mean ratings were higher for African American than white people who smoke on 26 of the 30 days (P<.001). Odds of quitting as measured by 30-day cessation were significantly higher for African Americans (odds ratio 2.3, 95% CI 1.04-5.53; P=.03) and did not change after adjusting for allowing smoking at home. Conclusions: Our study highlighted the potential of using a recommender system to personalize for African American people who smoke. © Jamie M Faro, Catherine S Nagawa, Jeroan A Allison, Stephenie C Lemon, Kathleen M Mazor, Thomas K Houston, Rajani S Sadasivam.

AB  - Digital games represent an appropriate test scenario to investigate the agents' ability to detect changes in the behavior of other agents trying to prevent them from fulfilling their objectives. Such ability allows the agents to adapt their decision-making process to adequately deal with those changes. The Markov Chain based algorithm M-DBScan is a successful tool conceived to detect novelties in data stream scenarios. Such algorithm has been validated in artificially controlled situations in games in which a single set of features and a single Markov Chain are sufficient to represent the data and to detect the occurrence of novelties, which usually is not enough to make the agents able to adequately perceive the environment changes in real game situations. The main contribution of the present work is then to investigate how to improve the use of M-DBScan as a tool for detecting behavior changes in the context of real and dynamic StarCraft games by using distinct sets of features and Markov Chains to represent the peculiarities of relevant game stages. Further, distinctly from the existing researches, here M-DBScan is validated in situations in which the timestamp, between successive novelties, is not constant. © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Traditional design methods are inspired by introverted self-salvation or creativity-driven design. In the era of big data, they are gradually driven by vast data. Design innovation without data is increasingly lacking in persuasion. The design of data participation increasingly faces market risks. Moreover, with the progress of artificial intelligence, such a technological innovation will eventually deconstruct the existing field of design innovation, its impact will continue, and it may fundamentally spawn new design ideas and methods.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - According to Big Data, the personal brand keywords of convergent talent ‘Steve Jobs’ are ‘first’, ‘innovation’, ‘creativity’, ‘change’, ‘design’, ‘Siri’ and ‘presentation’. Steve Jobs’ fandom wants to buy and keep products that it the association keyword. Steve Jobs’ products are ‘Steve Jobs speech’, ‘Steve Jobs presentation’, ‘Steve Jobs book’, ‘Steve Jobs last words’, ‘Corporate Culture Marketing Activities based on Steve Jobs’, ‘Steve Jobs’ Persuasion Technique’ And ‘Artificial intelligence music education’. Fandom acts as a link in the process of interacting as if brands treat people as people and form human relationships. Therefore, Star Fandom analyzes and monitors the data of SNS channels. Also, it is necessary to plan commercialization suitable for star fandom. © 2020 Pushpa Publishing House, Prayagraj, India.

AB  - While agent-based modelling languages naturally implement concurrency, the currently available languages for argumentation do not allow to explicitly model this type of interaction. In this paper we introduce a concurrent language for handling process arguing and communicating using a shared argumentation framework (reminding shared constraint store as in concurrent constraint). We introduce also basic expansions, contraction and revision procedures as main bricks for enforcement, debate, negotiation and persuasion. Copyright © 2020 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - A negotiation process by 2 agents e1 and e2 can be interleaved by another negotiation process between, say, e1 and e3. The interleaving may alter the resource allocation assumed at the inception of the first negotiation process. Existing proposals for argumentation-based negotiations have focused primarily on two-agent bilateral negotiations, but scarcely on the concurrency of multi-agent negotiations. To fill the gap, we present a novel argumentation theory, basing its development on abstract persuasion argumentation (which is an abstract argumentation formalism with a dynamic relation). Incorporating into it numerical information and a mechanism of handshakes among members of the dynamic relation, we show that the extended theory adapts well to concurrent multi-agent negotiations over scarce resources. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Contemporary psychiatry has become increasingly focused on biological treatments. Many critics claim that the current paradigm of psychiatry has failed to address the escalating mental health-care needs of our communities and may even be contributing to psychopathology and the burden of mental illness. This article describes the foundations of Integral Theory and proposes that this model offers a framework for developing integral psychiatry and a more effective and compassionate mental health-care system. An integral model of psychiatry extends biopsychosocial approaches and provides the scaffolding for more effective approaches to integrative mental health care. Furthermore, rather than focusing on psychopathology, the Integral theory model describes the emergence of human consciousness and supports a mental health-care system that addresses mental illness but also promotes human flourishing. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Previous research indicates that synthetic speech can be as persuasive as human speech. However, there is a lack of empirical validation on interactive goal-oriented tasks. In our two-stage study (online listening test and lab evaluation), we compared participants' perception of the persuasiveness of synthetic voices created from speech in a debating style vs. speech from audio-books. Participants interacted with our Conversational Agent (CA) to complete 4 flight-booking tasks and were asked to evaluate the voice, message and perceived personal qualities. We found that participants who interacted with the CA using the voice created from debating style speech rated it as significantly more truthful and more involved than the CA using the audio-book-based voice. However, there was no difference in how frequently each group followed the CA's recommendations. We hope our investigation will provoke discussion about the impact of different synthetic voices on users' perceptions of CAs in goal-oriented tasks. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Our understanding of human behavior and how to effect changes in behavior have evolved to the point where behavior change techniques have been applied successfully in areas as diverse as public health, advertising and retail. Despite its successes, behavior change science remains largely unknown among the engineering and technology community. In this chapter we provide a brief introduction to a vast field of knowledge. We describe practical behavior change tools and techniques that can be used to design behavioral interventions as elements of complex projects such as are typical of the sharing economy. Structured design of behavioral change programs is discussed and key concepts discussed followed by an overview of important techniques such as the COM-B Model, the Behavior Change Wheel. The Taxonomy of Behavior Change Techniques we discuss sits in an exciting area of active research using ontology techniques to organize knowledge. This approach lends itself naturally to application of technological tools such as artificial intelligence. Behavior change is a rapidly evolving science with sufficient rigorous and structured underpinnings to support more holistic design of complex projects where human behaviors are critical to sustainability and long-term success. We invite the reader to see this chapter as a practical introduction and to use the accompanying references to explore the literature around this fascinating subject. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Persuasive technologies to support behaviour change (e.g., fitness trackers) have become increasingly popular among consumers and healthcare providers. However, studies show that such technologies often fail to offer long-term engagement and tangible health benefits. In this regards, the specific design of persuasive messages provided by the device and users’ reactions to it may play a critical role. Our research explores the potential of applying theories of construal level and communication style to formulating feedback messages in self-improvement technologies. Two experiments (N = 190, N = 177) examine the influence of these two factors on goal commitment and affect-based evaluation for situations of fitness goal attainment and failure. Overall, construal level and communication style were relevant factors with independent influence. In the positive situation of goal attainment, high construal level and a friendly communication style resulted in significantly more goal commitment and positive affect than low construal level and a dominant communication style. In the negative situation of failure, results were overall less unambiguous and need to be consolidated by further research. Implications for the design of persuasive feedback are discussed. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS) help users to make more informed and more effective decisions. In recent years, many intelligent DSS (IDSS) in business contexts involve machine learning (ML) methods, which make them inherently hard to explain and comprehend logically. Incomprehensible predictions, however, might violate the users' expectations. While explanations can help with this, prior research also shows that providing explanations in all situations may negatively impact trust and adherence, especially for users experienced in the decision task at hand. We used a human-centered design approach with domain experts to design a DSS for funds management in the construction industry and identified a strong need for control, personal involvement, and adequate data. To create an adequate level of trust and reliance, we contrasted the system's predictions with the values derived from an analytic hierarchical process (AHP), which makes the relative importance of our users' decision-making criteria explicit. We developed a prototype and evaluated its acceptance with 7 construction industry experts. By identifying situations in which the ML prediction and the domain expert potentially disagree, the DSS can identify a persuasion gap and use explanations more selectively. Our evaluation showed promising results and we plan to generalize our approach to a wider range of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) problems, e.g., to provide explanations with arguments tailored to the user. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Our research aims to develop interactive, social agents that can coach people to learn new tasks, skills, and habits. In this article, we focus on coaching sedentary, overweight individuals (i.e., "trainees") to exercise regularly. We employ adaptive goal setting in which the intelligent health coach generates, tracks, and revises personalized exercise goals for a trainee. The goals become incrementally more difficult as the trainee progresses through the training program. Our approach is model-based - the coach maintains a parameterized model of the trainee's aerobic capability that drives its expectation of the trainee's performance. The model is continually revised based on trainee-coach interactions. The coach is embodied in a smartphone application, NutriWalking, which serves as a medium for coach-trainee interaction. We adopt a task-centric evaluation approach for studying the utility of the proposed algorithm in promoting regular aerobic exercise. We show that our approach can adapt the trainee program not only to several trainees with different capabilities but also to how a trainee's capability improves as they begin to exercise more. Experts rate the goals selected by the coach better than other plausible goals, demonstrating that our approach is consistent with clinical recommendations. Further, in a 6-week observational study with sedentary participants, we show that the proposed approach helps increase exercise volume performed each week.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - This paper surveys the landscape of potential security threats from malicious use of artificial intelligence technologies (MUAI) in Latin America. This study is based on scenario analysis to identify the MUAI-related cultural threats for region geopolitical balance. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities stimulates the transition to a new technological order. These technologies with indeed many social applications benefits also transform nations power relations and lead to the new threats and vulnerabilities in the field of international psychological security (IPS), turning artificial intelligence and geopolitics more closer and challenging democracy and national security traditional models. AI-based technologies interact with peoples cognitive assumptions and provide any individual, group, organisation or nation-state to influence on public consciousness as a new kind of weapon in the global system. Research results look at how behavior, self-efficacy and privacy attitude are affected by culture compared to other psychological and demographics variables. It also examines what kind of data people tend to share online and how culture affects these choices. This study presents a multi-cultural view of MUAI for regional balance in Latin America, supports the idea of cultural competency as a mechanism of social influence and sets the distribution of power from the notion of security as a socio-cultural phenomenon. AI is highly likely to have different social impacts for region geopolitical balance depending on people cultural settings traced by customs, values and behaviours. This paper confirms that MUAI elevates threats to IPS to a qualitatively new level, which requires an adequate assessment and reaction from society. The comprehension of cross-cultural new threats of MUAI lead to formulate large-scale strategies to protect the sovereignty and enforce regional roles for building consensus, engagement and international collaboration, and forced experts to assume the ethic implications of surveillance, persuasion, and physical target identification for region balance. © ECIAIR 2020.All right reserved.

AB  - Talk therapy (which is also known as psychotherapy) is an important and growing field to a range of treatment for depression, bipolar disorder or other mood disorders. A good therapist can help a person to cope with his or her feelings and thought patterns and adapt to their sentiments by problem solving and changing behavior patterns that may contribute to the cognitive distortions or the disorder’s symptoms.While Conversational AI is the study of techniques and strategies for software agents that can engage in natural conversational interactions with humans. As of late, many conversational interfaces/assistants such as Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, Apple’s Siri, J.A.R.V.I.S and others have become a focal point in both academic and industrial research because of their rapid market uptake and rapidly increasing range and scope of capabilities. The first generation of these Conversational assistants have been focused on short errand situated discourse as opposed to longer freestyle discussions and task-oriented dialog rather than longer free-form conversations that occur naturally in social, emotional and professional human interaction using human language. Achieving sustained, coherent, intelligible and engaging dialog are the next frontiers for conversational AI. Adding to these features of a conversational AI using NLP, introduction of a conversational therapeutic assistant which will help in these various procedures of psychotherapy and treatment of these mental disorders using Cognitive behavioral therapy(CBT) which is a short-term therapy technique approach that can help people find new ways to induce behavioral changes by changing their thought patterns. © 2020 SERSC.

TI  - Looking beneath the tip of the iceberg: The two-sided nature of chatbots and their roles for digital feedback exchange

AB  - Enterprises are forecasted to spend more on chatbots than on mobile app development by 2021. Up to today little is known on the roles chatbots play in facilitating feedback exchange. However, digitization and automation put pressure on companies to setup digital work environments that enable reskilling of employees. Therefore, a structured analysis of feedback-related chatbots for Slack was conducted. Our results propose six archetypes that reveal the roles of chatbots in facilitating feedback exchange on performance, culture and ideas. We show that chatbots do not only consist of conversational agents integrated into instant messenger but are tightly linked to complementary front-end systems such as mobile and web apps. Like the upper part of an iceberg, the conversational agent is above water and visible within the chat, whereas many user interactions of feedback-related chatbots are only possible outside of the instant messenger. Further, we extract six design principles for chatbots as digital feedback systems. We do this by analyzing chatbots and linking empirically observed design features to (meta-)requirements derived from explanatory theory on feedback, self-determination and persuasive systems. The results suggest that chatbots benefit the social environment of conversation agents and the richness of the graphical user interface of external applications. © 27th European Conference on Information Systems - Information Systems for a Sharing Society, ECIS 2019.

AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) devices are inherently vulnerable due to insecure design, implementation, and configuration. Aggressive behavior change, due to increased attacker’s sophistication, and the heterogeneity of the data in IoT have proven that securing IoT devices is a making challenge. To detect intensive attacks and increase device uptime, we propose a novel ensemble learning model for IoT anomaly detection using software-defined networks (SDN). We use a deep auto-encoder to extract handy features for stacking into an ensemble learning model. The learned model is deployed in the SDN controller to detect anomalies or dynamic attacks in IoT by addressing the class imbalance problem. We validate the model with real-time testbed and benchmark datasets. The initial results show that our model has a better and more reliable performance than the competing models showcased in the relevant related work. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Voice User Interfaces have become popular with the advent of Alexa, Google Home, Cortana and other commercial speech recognition interfaces; however, the privacy of the end users is compromised while using these interfaces in public. In addition, users can feel a bit awkward while using these interfaces with loud voice while they are outside their homes. Contextually, 'Hypnosis' and 'Hypnotherapy' have not been frequently applied as a way of human communications although the principle of suggestion induced behavior changes in an interesting approach to interact with machines. In this paper, GEORGIE a prototype AI was used to achieve a novel means of interaction inspired from the principles of hypnotherapy, which is a discrete interface ensuring that end-users' privacy is not compromised. It is envisaged that people who prefer secret communication and interaction might love to use this hypnotic computer interface (hypCI). The hypCI would be the novel means of human robot interface (HRI) or human computer interface (HCI). © 2020 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - From a perspective of behavioral change, we review medical chatbot literature included in top peer-reviewed journals and conferences, and build up a comprehensive picture. We examine literature on how people feel about using a medical chatbot and based on that how far chatbots are useful to change harmful behavior. To structure the review we use the theory of planned behavior and the theory of reasoned action. Based on this we conclude five design-oriented recommendations. We expect this research to identify behavioral aspects that contribute to the acceptance, usage and effectiveness of medical chatbots in future. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - The transition of the energy system into a more efficient state requires innovative ideas to finance new schemes and engage people into adjusting their behavioural patterns concerning consumption. Effective energy management combined with Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) open new opportunities for local and regional authorities, but also for energy suppliers, utilities and other obligated parties, or even energy cooperatives, to implement mechanisms that allow people to become more efficient either by producing and trading energy or by reducing their energy consumption. In this paper, a novel framework is proposed connecting energy savings with a digital energy currency. This framework builds reward schemes where the energy end-users could benefit financially from saving energy, by receiving coins according to their real consumption compared to the predicted consumption if no actions were to take place. A pilot appraisal of such a scheme is presented for the case of Bahrain, so as to simulate the behaviour of the proposed framework in order for it to become a viable choice for intelligent energy management in future action plans. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Most interactions or relationships among objects or entities can be modelled as graphs. Some classes of entity relationships have their own name due to their popularity; social graphs look at people’s relationships, computer networks show how computers (devices) communicate with each other and molecules represent the chemical bonds between atoms. Some graphs can also be dynamic in the sense that, over time, relationships change. Since the entities can, to a certain extent, manage their relationships, we say any changes in relationships reflect a change in entity behaviour. By comparing the relationships of an entity at different points in time, we can say there has been a change in behaviour. In this paper, we attempt to detect malicious devices in a network by showing a significant change in behaviour through analysing traffic data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Privacy in Social Network Sites (SNSs) like Facebook or Instagram is closely related to people's selfdisclosure decisions and their ability to foresee the consequences of sharing personal information with large and diverse audiences. Nonetheless, online privacy decisions are often based on spurious risk judgements that make people liable to reveal sensitive data to untrusted recipients and become victims of social engineering attacks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) in combination with persuasive mechanisms like nudging is a promising approach for promoting preventative privacy behaviour among the users of SNSs. Nevertheless, combining behavioural interventions with high levels of personalization can be a potential threat to people's agency and autonomy even when applied to the design of social engineering countermeasures. This paper elaborates on the ethical challenges that nudging mechanisms can introduce to the development of AI-based countermeasures, particularly to those addressing unsafe self-disclosure practices in SNSs. Overall, it endorses the elaboration of personalized risk awareness solutions as i) an ethical approach to counteract social engineering, and ii) as an effective means for promoting reflective privacy decisions.

AB  - Intelligent conversational agents, or chatbots, can take on various identities and are increasingly engaging in more human-centered conversations with persuasive goals. However, little is known about how identities and inquiry strategies influence the conversation's effectiveness. We conducted an online study involving 790 participants to be persuaded by a chatbot for charity donation. We designed a two by four factorial experiment (two chatbot identities and four inquiry strategies) where participants were randomly assigned to different conditions. Findings showed that the perceived identity of the chatbot had significant effects on the persuasion outcome (i.e., donation) and interpersonal perceptions (i.e., competence, confidence, warmth, and sincerity). Further, we identified interaction effects among perceived identities and inquiry strategies. We discuss the findings for theoretical and practical implications for developing ethical and effective persuasive chatbots. Our published data, codes, and analyses serve as the first step towards building competent ethical persuasive chatbots. © 2020 ACM.

AB  - Introduction: Parental psychopathology has been defined in respect of psychopathological development in early childhood. This study aimed to investigate the effects of parental psychopathologies on social and emotional problems in the age range of 1–3 years and to determine children at risk. Methods: The study data were obtained from the 2009 Early Childhood Mental Health Profile taking population distribution into consideration with the properties representing Turkey. The primary caregiver of the child completed the Psychiatric Evaluation Form for 1–3 years, the Brief Infant-Toddler Social Emotional Assessment (BITSEA), the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) for themselves. Machine learning models used for prediction. The performance of prediction models was evaluated with the ten-fold cross-validation method. Area Under Curve (AUC) values were calculated with Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the performance of each model. Results: The evaluation was made of the data of 2775 children, comprising 1507 (54.3%) males and 1268 (45.7%) females with a mean age of 26.19±9.11 months (range, 10–48 months). A total of 106 children were identified as at risk, as they were above the clinical cut-off point (1.5 standard deviations) of the BITSEA points and below the cut-off points of any one of the developmental areas of the ASQ. Modeling was applied to the data of these 106 children. The Support Vector Machines (SVM) model was selected for prediction with the automatically optimized highest AUC value. Weighting for the SVM algorithm showed mothers’ BSI scores, fathers’ education and health problems, duration of breastfeeding, unplanned pregnancy are significant for predicting BITSEA-problem scores in the model. Conclusion: To be able to understand the complex relationship with parental psychopathology and behavioral problems, machine learning methods were used successfully in this study. Further studies with more massive data sets, more extended follow-up periods, and stronger algorithms will be able to identify risk groups earlier and allow early interventions to be implemented. © 2020 by Turkish Association of Neuropsychiatry.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants’ willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods: The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results: Three broad themes: ‘Understanding of chatbots’, ‘AI hesitancy’ and ‘Motivations for health chatbots’ were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13–0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60–0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08–8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77–4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13–3.25]. Conclusion: Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients’ concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients’ perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Active learning is an important part of modern engineering education. It directly engages students in the learning process, helping them think and creatively solve problems. Often this is done in the context of a team project involving group activities both inside and outside the classroom. Analysis and Design of Propulsion Systems is an elective course that has been a traditional lecture course at Baylor University, teaching gas turbine engines using cycle design. In an effort to involve the students more in the learning process, active learning modules were introduced to make the course more interactive. The active learning modules involved assigning students into teams of four that were formed using the Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) software. Each team was to operate as a commercial company which included picking a name, developing a logo, and writing a mission statement similar to actual commercial companies. The point of having each team become a commercial company was to foster competition. The companies were tasked to eventually design the lowest cost, most efficient high bypass turbofan engine to replace the existing engines on the B-52H bomber. Each company wrote a persuasive position paper on whether or not the B-52H should be re-engined and a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the re-engined B-52H. Gas turbine cycle design occurred using a three part design project. The engine cycle of choice for this re-design was the high bypass turbofan. Phase one was a detailed mission analysis incorporating the requirements from the RFP and leading to the selection of a design point, the calculation of the required installed thrust for each leg (and consequently the uninstalled thrust for each leg), as well as an average uninstalled specific fuel consumption for the mission. On-design, the next phase in the design process, used an on-design analysis at the design point which resulted in a selection of a fan pressure ratio, an overall pressure ratio, and a bypass ratio. The last phase examined the chosen engine at off-design mission points and the final fuel was calculated using actual uninstalled specific fuel consumption values to assure the fuel reserve was met. All phases were incorporated into a final report. To conclude the process, each team presented their engine as if they were a company seeking to sell their product to a customer. The customer, the professor, then picked an overall winner based on the information presented. Assessment of the course showed that the students appreciated the competitive environment giving them insight into how a gas turbine company might operate. In conclusion, the active learning modules and team competition with the design project were effective in challenging and exciting the students about the design of gas turbine engines. The company context for teams prepares students for what to expect should they work in the gas turbine industry. Copyright © 2019 ASME.

AB  - A successful dialogue requires that the participants have a shared understanding of what they are trying to achieve, individually and collectively. This coordination can be achieved if both recognise the type of dialogue in which they are engaged. We focus on two particular dialogue types, action persuasion and deliberation dialogues, which are often conflated because they share similar speech acts. Previously, a clear distinction was made between the two in terms of the different pre- and post-conditions used for the speech acts within these dialogues. This prior work gave formal specifications of the dialogue moves within the dialogues but offered no evaluation through implementation. In this paper, we present an implementation to demonstrate that the two dialogue types described in this way can be realised in software to support focussed communication between autonomous agents. We provide the design and implementation details of our new tool along with an evaluation of the software. The tool we have produced captures the distinctive features of each of the two dialogue types, to make plain their differences and to validate the speech acts for use in practical scenarios. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Objective: We aim to deliver a framework with 2 main objectives: 1) facilitating the design of theory-driven, adaptive, digital interventions addressing chronic illnesses or health problems and 2) producing personalized intervention delivery strategies to support self-management by optimizing various intervention components tailored to people's individual needs, momentary contexts, and psychosocial variables. Materials and Methods: We propose a template-based digital intervention design mechanism enabling the configuration of evidence-based, just-in-time, adaptive intervention components. The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions. Results: We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines. Furthermore, we provide intervention definitions for a real-world care program targeting diabetes patients. Finally, we validate the personalized delivery mechanism through a set of hypotheses, asserting certain ways of adaptation in the delivery strategy, according to the differences in simulation related to personal preferences, traits, and lifestyle patterns. Conclusion: While the design mechanism is sufficiently expandable to meet the theoretical and clinical intervention design requirements, the personalization algorithm is capable of adapting intervention delivery strategies for simulated real-life conditions. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The motivational impact of gamification elements differs substantially across users. To account for these differences, we investigate Hexad user types and behavior change intentions as factors to personalize gamifed, persuasive fitness systems. We conducted an online study (N = 179), measuring the perceived persuasiveness of twelve gamification elements using storyboards. Results show the applicability of the Hexad user type in the Physical Activity domain. Besides replicating correlations between gamification elements and user types, we also found correlations which were hypothesized in literature, but not yet shown. Our main contribution is to show that behavior change intentions influence the perception of gamification elements in general and affect the set of relevant elements for each user type. Since a static set of elements has been suggested for each user type so far, this is an important finding, leading to potentially more effective personalization approaches. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Non-adherence? to a treatment plan recommended by the therapist is a key cause of the increasing rate of chronic medical conditions globally. The therapist-patient therapeutic alliance is regarded as a successful intervention and a good predictor of treatment adherence. Similar to the human scenario, embodied conversational agents (ECAs) showed evidence of their ability to build an agent-patient therapeutic alliance, which motivates the effort to advance ECAs as a potential solution to improve treatment adherence and consequently the health outcome. Building therapeutic alliance implies the need for a positive environment where the ECA and the patient can share their knowledge and discuss their goals, preferences and tasks towards building a shared plan, which is commonly done using explanations. However, explainable agents commonly rely on their own knowledge and goals in providing explanations, rather than the beliefs, plans or goals of the user. It is not clear whether such explanations, in individual-specific contexts such as personal health assistance, are perceived by the user as relevant in decision-making towards their own behavior change. Therefore, in this research, we are developing a user-aware explainable ECA by embedding the cognitive agent architecture with a user model, explanation engine and modified planner to implement the concept of SharedPlans. The developed agent will be deployed and evaluated with real patients and the therapeutic alliance will be measured using standard measurements. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Direct selling is a business model that presents opportunities for personal, professional and economic development for all those people who wish to obtain income through the generation of their own business, based on the formation of sales networks. For that reason, direct sellers have objectives that transcend the sales activities themselves, such as establishing sustainable interpersonal relationships with their clients in the medium and long term and being able to run their own business. In this work, we study personality traits and personal profiles of sellers who operate under this modality through the DISC test, studying the twelve main combinations. These results are subjected to statistical analysis and then incorporated into a business intelligence platform which contains traditional data such as sales, billing, personal data and seniority. The results, in the first place, validate those desirable traits for a traditional seller, referenced in the bibliography, such as kindness and persuasiveness. Nevertheless, this research highlight other personality traits that contribute to the success of the direct sellers and that are especially desirable for this business, for example, long-term reliability, self-motivation, proactivity and the ability to make decisions under pressure. The incorporation of this type of data supposes an added value for the management of direct selling businesses. Besides, the integration with business intelligence platform contributes to the efficiency of the information management. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Social technology, in particular, social media has increasingly become part of individual's life. People rely on social media interaction to relate with other people and satisfy their leisure or behavioural support purposes. Features such as those presented in the Honeycomb ecology, e.g. sharing, profiling and reputation, are used as means to that end. Recent designs of technology embed social features in them, enabling people to talk to the machine and interact with it as a sentient being, e.g. chatbot and robots, or use it as a mediator for social interaction, e.g. Social Internet of Things (SIoT). However, we argue that over-reliance on social media may result in a problematic attachment to it leading to a negative impact on users' wellbeing. We conduct a multi-stages study to explore the negative psychological states that social media features can trigger. We mainly employ diary studies trying to increase the ecological validity of our data. We also discuss the enrichment of social media with tools to aid people in staying in control of their attachment and the risks such tools can introduce to user experience as well as their behaviour change process. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Lane changes are stressful maneuvers for drivers, particularly during high-speed traffic flows. Modeling driver's lane-changing decision and implementation process is challenging due to the complexity and uncertainty of driving behaviors. To address this issue, this paper presents a personalized Model, LCPM, for Lane-Changing Behavior Prediction based on the Root Residual Network (Root-ResNet) backbone from vehicle dynamics data and driver physiological data. Firstly, with abundant inputs of Root-ResNet, LCPM is able to exploit more local information from two differing modality data. Secondly, LCPM has an ability of using global information to selectively emphasise informative features and suppress less useful ones with a special regularization method, Weighted Channel Dropout (WCD). The experimental results show that the LCPM is capable of learning the latent features of lane-changing behaviors and achieving significantly better performance than other popular networks on a real-world driving dataset. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - The global prevalence of diabetes is escalating. Attributable deaths and avoidable health costs related to diabetes represent a substantial burden and threaten the sustainability of contemporary healthcare systems. Information technologies are an encouraging avenue to tackle the challenge of diabetes management. Anthropomorphic virtual assistants designed as relational agents have demonstrated acceptability to older people and may promote long-term engagement. The VASelfCare project aims to develop and test a virtual assistant software prototype to facilitate the self-care of older adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The present position paper describes key aspects of the VASelfCare prototype and discusses the potential use of artificial intelligence. Machine learning techniques represent promising approaches to provide a more personalised user experience with the prototype, by means of behaviour adaptation of the virtual assistant to users’ preferences or emotions or to develop chatbots. The effect of these sophisticated approaches on relevant endpoints, such as users’ engagement and motivation, needs to be established in comparison to less responsive options.

AB  - This work proposes a persuasion model based on argumentation theory and users’ characteristics for improving the use of resources in bike sharing systems, fostering the use of the bicycles and thus contributing to greater energy sustainability by reducing the use of carbon-based fuels. More specifically, it aims to achieve a balanced network of pick-up and drop-off stations in urban areas with the help of the users, thus reducing the dedicated management trucks that redistribute bikes among stations. The proposal aims to persuade users to choose different routes from the shortest route between a start and an end location. This persuasion is carried out when it is not possible to park the bike in the desired station due to the lack of parking slots, or when the user is highly influenceable. Differently to other works, instead of employing a single criteria to recommend alternative stations, the proposed system can incorporate a variety of criteria. This result is achieved by providing a defeasible logic-based persuasion engine that is capable of aggregating the results from multiple recommendation rules. The proposed framework is showcased with an example scenario of a bike sharing system. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - New applications of digital health software and sensors for diabetes are rapidly becoming available. The link between healthcare, wearable or carryable devices, and the use of smartphones is increasingly being used by patients for timely information and by healthcare professionals to deliver information and personalized advice and to encourage healthy behavior. To assemble stakeholders from academia, industry, and government, Diabetes Technology Society and Sansum Diabetes Research Institute hosted the 3rd Annual Digital Diabetes Congress on May 14-15, 2019 in San Francisco. Physicians, entrepreneurs, attorneys, psychologists, and other leaders in the diabetes technology field came together to discuss current and future trends and applications of digital tools in diabetes. The meeting focused on eight topics: 1) User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) for Digital Health, 2) clinical aspects, 3) marketing, 4) investment, 5) regulation, 6) who owns the data, 7) engagement, and 8) the future of digital health. This meeting report contains summaries of the meeting’s eight plenary sessions and eight panel discussions, which were all focused on an important aspect of the development, use, and regulation of diabetes digital tools. © 2019 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - Reasoning has three types, deduction, induction, and abduction, of which we perceive deduction to be necessarily true, induction plausibly true, and abduction only hypothetically true. Syllogistic is a theory of deductive reasoning, introducing three figures of inferencing, of which figure-1 is obviously true, figure-3 and figure-2 are increasingly less transparent. We argue that the three figures of syllogistic and the three types of reasoning are related and their truth perceptions can be explained as different degrees of belief. We suggest that the source of this difference can be found in the conversion of a premise required by syllogistic processing. Experimental results illustrating our theory are included. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The evidence that quality of life is a positive variable for the survival of cancer patients has prompted the interest of the health and pharmaceutical industry in considering that variable as a final clinical outcome. Sustained improvements in cancer care in recent years have resulted in increased numbers of people living with and beyond cancer, with increased attention being placed on improving quality of life for those individuals. Connected Health provides the foundations for the transformation of cancer care into a patient-centric model, focused on providing fully connected, personalized support and therapy for the unique needs of each patient. Connected Health creates an opportunity to overcome barriers to health care support among patients diagnosed with chronic conditions. This paper provides an overview of important areas for the foundations of the creation of a new Connected Health paradigm in cancer care. Here we discuss the capabilities of mobile and wearable technologies; we also discuss pervasive and persuasive strategies and device systems to provide multidisciplinary and inclusive approaches for cancer patients for mental well-being, physical activity promotion, and rehabilitation. Several examples already show that there is enthusiasm in strengthening the possibilities offered by Connected Health in persuasive and pervasive technology in cancer care. Developments harnessing the Internet of Things, personalization, patient-centered design, and artificial intelligence help to monitor and assess the health status of cancer patients. Furthermore, this paper analyses the data infrastructure ecosystem for Connected Health and its semantic interoperability with the Connected Health economy ecosystem and its associated barriers. Interoperability is essential when developing Connected Health solutions that integrate with health systems and electronic health records. Given the exponential business growth of the Connected Health economy, there is an urgent need to develop mHealth (mobile health) exponentially, making it both an attractive and challenging market. In conclusion, there is a need for user-centered and multidisciplinary standards of practice to the design, development, evaluation, and implementation of Connected Health interventions in cancer care to ensure their acceptability, practicality, feasibility, effectiveness, affordability, safety, and equity. © 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - The number of people with diabetes is increasing in every European country and like all chronic diseases it cannot be cured. However, patient empowerment is an acknowledged strategy for improving the patients’ health situation. This paper describes the Action Plan Engine developed as a tool for diabetes patients in the POWER2DM project. The Action Plan Engine offers a guided workflow based on treatment goals and activities. A periodic review evaluates how successful a patient has fulfilled these goals and activities. Part of the evaluation is detailed feedback, in particular about 170 interventions based on Behaviour Change Techniques in order to change a patient’s lifestyle behaviour towards a healthier, diabetes-appropriate lifestyle. Additionally, the Action Plan Engine offers decision trees for coping with barriers regarding glucose monitoring, exercise, carbohydrate, insulin and stress. © 2019 The authors, AIT Austrian Institute of Technology and IOS Press.

AB  - To increase the number of African Americans in the highly demanding computing field, a conversational agent is being developed, serving as a supplemental virtual mentor for Black students pursuing the professoriate in engineering or computing. As data on the interest of Black undergraduates in pursuing the engineering and computing professoriate is limited in the literature, it is important to identify the level of interest, factors that contribute to, and questions Black students have about pursuing the professoriate. A survey was administered to undergraduate students at an HBCU enrolled in one of three computer science courses. The results identify levels of likelihood, persuasion and discouragement themes, as well as frequently asked questions over several variables for pursuing the professoriate in STEM as an African American. Questions and data on question type, grammar, syntax and word choice will be used to improve the knowledge database of the virtual mentor. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Lagrangian duality underlies both classical and modern mechanism design. In particular, the dual perspective often permits simple and detail-free characterizations of optimal and approximately optimal mechanisms. This paper applies this same methodology to a close cousin of traditional mechanism design, one which shares conceptual and technical elements with its more mature relative: the burgeoning field of persuasion. The dual perspective permits us to analyze optimal persuasion schemes both in settings which have been analyzed in prior work, as well as for natural generalizations which we are the first to explore in depth. Most notably, we permit combining persuasion policies with payments, which serve to augment the persuasion power of the scheme. In both single and multi-receiver settings, as well as under a variety of constraints on payments, we employ duality to obtain structural insights, as well as tractable and simple characterizations of optimal policies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Mobile health (mHealth) and other highly pervasive, interactive and adaptive digital systems offer an enormous opportunity for enabling theory-based health behavior-change interventions that are replicable, scalable, and sustainable. Such advances could have great impact, and they offer great opportunities for advances in artificial intelligence (AI), psychology, and social science. Unfortunately, the technical challenges of developing AI to support healthier behaviors generally fall into the category of “not suitable for machine learning.” This presentation will summarize recent research with the Fittle+ mHealth systems and predictive models of the daily effects of individual-level mHealth interventions. The models are developed in a computational cognitive architecture and rely on Instance Based Learning Theory and ACT-R learning mechanisms. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Computers are Social Actors (CASA) paradigm was proposed more than two decades ago to understand humans’ interaction with computer technologies. Today, as emerging technologies like social robots become more personal and persuasive, questions of how users respond to them socially, what individual factors leverage the relationship, and what constitutes the social influence of these technologies need to be addressed. A lab experiment was conducted to examine the interactions between individual differences and social robots’ vocal and kinetic cues. Results suggested that users developed more trust in a social robot with a human voice than with a synthetic voice. Users also developed more intimacy and interest in the social robot when it was paired with humanlike gestures. Moreover, individual differences including users’ gender, attitudes toward robots, and robot exposure affected their psychological responses. The theoretical, practical, and ethical value of the findings was further discussed in the study. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Behavioral intervention technologies (BITs) are unique ways to incorporate the benefits of technology and psychology to address differing health needs through various media, including Internet interventions, mobile apps, and video games. BITs present several possible benefits, including increased dissemination and accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, and decreased stigma, especially among youth. A behavioral coaching chatbot, Tess, addresses different facets of behavioral health, such as depression and anxiety. Available 24/7, Tess delivers customized integrative support, psychoeducation, and interventions through brief conversations via existing communication channels (i.e., SMS text messaging and Facebook Messenger). This study assessed the feasibility of integrating Tess in behavioral counseling of adolescent patients (n = 23; Mage = 15.20 years; Rangeage = 9.78-18.54 years; 57% female) coping with weight management and prediabetes symptoms. Tess engaged patients via a preferred method of communication (SMS text messaging) in individualized conversations to promote treatment adherence, behavior change, and overall wellness. Adolescent patients reported experiencing positive progress toward their goals 81% of the time. The 4,123 messages exchanged and patients' reported usefulness ratings (96% of the time) illustrate that adolescents engaged with and viewed this chatbot as helpful. These results highlight the feasibility and benefit of support through artificial intelligence, specifically in a pediatric setting, which could be scaled to serve larger groups of patients. As a partner to clinicians, Tess can continue the therapeutic interaction outside office hours while maintaining patient satisfaction. Due to Tess's capacity for continuous learning, future iterations may have additional features to increase the user experience. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - With the rapid development of the Internet and e-commerce, automatic negotiation has become a hot research topic. Due to its unique intelligence and interaction, agent can realize complex negotiation and has great advantages in the field of automatic negotiation. Agent-based debate negotiation can send information other than the proposal by making the negotiation more efficient. Persuasion debates consider more persuasion factors and make the negotiation process more rational. In order to adapt to the development of artificial intelligence efficiently, the emotion is introduced into the field of agent persuasion, which makes the agent's behavior more in line with human thinking and better simulates human emotional decisions. In consequence, the negotiation results are easier to understand and interpret. At this moment, agent has not only emotional ability, but also logical computing ability, which improves agent's adaptability in dynamic and complex environments, and achieves the goal of automatic negotiation effectively. In related research, different scholars and experts have studied agent-based persuasion and agent-based emotion from different perspectives. However, the following problems exist. First, the research on emotion is not comprehensive, especially the quantification of emotion. Second, the current research about the application of emotional theory in the agent persuasive field is not enough. Third, most of agent persuasion study is about interaction mechanism, and there is little research on the choice of cooperative subjects, especially the selection of cooperative subjects considering emotional factor. In the study of the selection of cooperative subjects, the selection model is more important, and the construction of the model is based on an effective cooperative subject evaluation model. Therefore, aiming at the shortcomings of the existing research, we classify the emotion-based emotion persuasion based on agent. According to the classification, we propose a corresponding formal model of emotion generation, and combine the first law of emotion intensity of psychology to quantify the emotion of agent. The agent's emotion intensity calculation method is proposed. Secondly, the evaluation of agent-based emotional persuasion is summarized as the evaluation of the agent's proposal and reliability. Subsequently, the multi-attribute utility function is used to establish the corresponding agent's proposal evaluation model, and the fuzzy membership function is used to establish the corresponding agent's reliability evaluation model. On the basis of the above two evaluation models, emotion is used as a new evaluation factor to establish an evaluation model of the subject's emotions. Three evaluation models are put forward comprehensively to construct a corresponding Agent-based emotional persuasive cooperation subject selection model. To illustrate the effectiveness of the above model, an example was designed and simulated. The simulation results show that emotion in emotional persuasion has an important influence on the choice of cooperative subjects. Among them, positive emotion enhances the comprehensive evaluation value in emotional persuasion and negative emotion weakens the comprehensive evaluation value. In the end, due to the influence of emotion, there are obvious differences between comprehensive evaluation values, which can significantly affect the ultimate selection of cooperative subjects. Based on this, the rationality and effectiveness of the model are verified. At the same time, it also illustrates the important influence of emotion on agent-based persuasiveness © 2019, Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The utilisation of embodied conversational agents (ECAs) to build a human-agent working alliance holds promise to promote health behavior change and improve health outcomes. Although ECAs have been shown to build empathic relationships with users, there is no complete framework to model working alliance. In this paper, we developed a framework that is grounded on theories and findings from social science and artificial intelligence to design a cognitive architecture for a user-aware explainable ECA. An empirical evaluation with 68 undergraduate students found differences in the efficacy of explanation to change behavior intention, build trust and working alliance depending on gender, stress levels and achievement aims; confirming the imperative of incorporating shared planning and user-tailored explanation in one framework. The empirical evaluation was limited in tailoring the explanation to the user's beliefs only; however, the analyses confirmed the need for considering adequate user information such as user's goals and preferences to build a user-aware explainable agent for behavior change towards improved health outcomes. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

AB  - Persuasive games for societal interventions aim to shape, reinforce or change players’ attitudes and behavior to help solving complex societal issues. In earlier work, we explored how persuasive game mechanics may contribute to the formation of attitudes in persuasive games. As a follow-up, this paper presents four design recommendations that could increase the chance that these attitudes will actually lead to the desired behavior shown by players after the game: viz., these attitudes require the right conditions to become a predictor of the desired, post-game behavior. In order to arrive at these recommendations we looked at relevant work from the field of social psychology. Next we linked our insights to the context of persuasive game design. This yielded four conceptual design recommendations for maximizing the likelihood for an attitude influenced by a persuasive game to result in the desired behavior in the real world; 1. aligning the degree of specification of a game’s message and the desired behavior 2. emphasizing the function of the attitude to be influenced 3. enabling players to reflect on their internal states 4. emphasizing personal relevance of an attitude to a behavioral choice So far, these recommendations are still theoretical in nature. We therefore discuss how future work should empirically examine these, including their implications for the effective use of persuasive game mechanics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - New technologies are emerging in all fields of science. Being the case of Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), these new technologies are affecting all fields of science, weather improving them or helping the end user into extracting new data, or analyzing data coming from these fields. One of the main focus area of IoT is on the Automotive side. The connected cars, self-driving cars, have been developed using the IoT concepts. New functionalities such as Semi-automatic selfdriving, finding of parking spaces, automatic self-parking vehicles, sending of data to servers via special services, all have been done with the help of IoT. The paper presents a new way of evaluating the car drivers based on data related to speed, acceleration, combined with the existing road signs. The end results will not only bring enhancement into the driving abilities, but also will bring great value to the maintenance of the vehicle and to the overall safety of the driving process. To obtain a better solution the system makes use of 3 algorithms for determining acceleration, breaking, speeding and lane changing behavior of the driver. By using IoT we aim to correct reckless driving, determine the causes of a defect, all based on statistical data collected over a period of time. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Designing systems with human agents is difficult because it often requires models that characterize agents’ responses to changes in the system's states and inputs. An example of this scenario occurs when designing treatments for obesity. While weight loss interventions through increasing physical activity and modifying diet have found success in reducing individuals’ weight, such programs are difficult to maintain over long periods of time due to lack of patient adherence. A promising approach to increase adherence is through the personalization of treatments to each patient. In this paper, we make a contribution toward treatment personalization by developing a framework for predictive modeling using utility functions that depend upon both time-varying system states and motivational states evolving according to some modeled process corresponding to qualitative social science models of behavior change. Computing the predictive model requires solving a bilevel program, which we reformulate as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This reformulation provides the first (to our knowledge) formulation for Bayesian inference that uses empirical histograms as prior distributions. We study the predictive ability of our framework using a data set from a weight loss intervention, and our predictive model is validated by comparison to standard machine learning approaches. We conclude by describing how our predictive model could be used for optimization, unlike standard machine learning approaches that cannot. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Raising awareness among young people, and especially students, on the relevance of behavior change for achieving energy savings is increasingly being considered as a key enabler towards long-term and cost-effective energy efficiency policies. However, the way to successfully apply educational interventions focused on such targets inside schools is still an open question. In this paper, we present our approach for enabling IoT-based energy savings and sustainability awareness lectures and promoting data-driven energy-saving behaviors focused on a high school audience. We present our experiences toward the successful application of sets of educational tools and software over a real-world Internet of Things (IoT) deployment. We discuss the use of gamification and competition as a very effective end-user engagement mechanism for school audiences. We also present the design of an IoT-based hands-on lab activity, integrated within a high school computer science curriculum utilizing IoT devices and data produced inside the school building, along with the Node-RED platform. We describe the tools used, the organization of the educational activities and related goals. We report on the experience carried out in both directions in a high school in Italy and conclude by discussing the results in terms of achieved energy savings within an observation period. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - This study is set in the framework of task-oriented conversational agents in which dialogue management is obtained via Reinforcement Learning. The aim is to explore the possibility to overcome the typical end-to-end training approach through the integration of a quantitative model developed in the field of persuasion psychology. Such integration is expected to accelerate the training phase and improve the quality of the dialogue obtained. In this way, the resulting agent would take advantage of some subtle psychological aspects of the interaction that would be difficult to elicit via end-to-end training. We propose a theoretical architecture in which the psychological model above is translated into a probabilistic predictor and then integrated in the reinforcement learning process, intended in its partially observable variant. The experimental validation of the architecture proposed is currently ongoing. Copyright © 2019 for this paper by its authors.

AB  - Research in eHealth has opened a new dimension to improve personal healthcare with the help of information and communication technologies (ICT). eHealth is an 'umbrella term' for the use of ICT for health. Remote care-giving technologies (mHealth, Telehealth, Telemedicine) are an extended branch of eHealth initiatives. The concept of health e-Coaching is another promising initiative of eHealth research for real-Time personalized lifestyle support. The focus of eHealth initiatives is to deliver high quality, evidence-based, secure, cost-effective, timely care to support people for sustaining a healthy lifestyle. However, the practical implementation of different eHealth initiatives has often been challenging to establish prophesied benefit. Health monitoring and fitness coaching with artificial intelligence will rule the coming decades. The pillars of e-Coaching initiatives are data collection, analysis of data, recommendation (sending the right message to the right people in the right context) and data security. An optimized system for health e-Coaching, management of a huge amount of health data, ensuring data protection are some big challenges to the eHealth researchers. Prediction of human psychology for effective e-Coaching recommendation is another level of difficulty to overcome as human behavior is constantly changing. Different eHealth initiatives for the promotion of healthy lifestyle and its implementation difficulties have been our primary focus of the review in this paper. This paper is a result of our early stage research related to 'Health e-Coaching recommendation system generation'. This paper will help young eHealth researchers to have a holistic idea on different eHealth technologies, initiatives till date for the promotion of healthy lifestyle and associated implementation challenges to overcome in the future. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Interventions in emergency situations with an aggressor are characterized by potentially high costs but no or very little direct reward for an intervening person. In such moral courage situations, the willingness to act is critical for the safety and well-being of others. Persuasive technology has a high potential for changing attitudes and behavior and thus, supporting such a behavior for the greater good. Aiming at identifying promising persuasive strategies, a meta-analysis to identify factors relevant for moral courage was conducted. Findings highlight seven attitude and competence factors with high potential for attitude and behavior change towards morally courageous behavior. By that, the process model of helping behavior as well as social and motivational psychology results can inform evidence-based persuasive design for technology for moral courage. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The description of a product or an ad's text can be rewritten in many ways if other text fragments which are similar in meaning substitute different words or phrases. A good selection of words or phrases, composing an ad, is very important for the creation of a good advertisement text, as the meaning of the text depends on this and it affects in a positive or a negative way the interest of the possible consumers towards the advertised product. In this paper we present a method for the optimization of advertisement texts through the use of interactive evolutionary computing techniques and fuzzy logic. The use of Fuzzy Logic enables to manage the uncertainty in the process of evolution. The EvoSpace platform is used to perform the evolution of a text, resulting in an optimized text, which should have a better impact on its readers in terms of persuasion. © 2019 ICAI 2015 - WORLDCOMP 2015.

AB  - Chatbots, also known as conversational agents or digital assistants, are artificial intelligence–driven software programs designed to interact with people in a conversational manner. They are often used for user-friendly customer-service triaging. In healthcare, chatbots can create bidirectional information exchange with patients, which could be leveraged for follow-up, screening, treatment adherence or data-collection. They can be deployed over various modalities, such as text-based services (text messaging, mobile applications, chat rooms) on any website or mobile applications, or audio services, such as Siri, Alexa, Cortana or Google Assistant. Potential applications are very promising, particularly in the field of oncology. In this review, we discuss the available publications and applications and the ongoing trials in that setting. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Recently, companies have begun to care more about the well-being of their employees. With the spread of sensors, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence, the movement to build a better working environment by utilizing these technologies has been spreading. Especially, research on behavior that can change lifestyle habits is becoming popular. In this paper, we summarize workplace behavior research and projects for sensing and changing human behavior in a workplace and aim to improve the productivity and wellness of employees. Also, we introduce concepts for future workplaces and some of our related achievements. For physical state sensing, we have developed a continuous posture-sensing chair, which will soon be available commercially. For internal state sensing, we propose a method for estimating quality of life with wearable sensors. Our system have already achieved to estimate QoL (Quality of Life) around 90% with only 9 questions. In addition, we propose interactive digital signage to provide habit-changing reminders. Through one month experiment, we confirmed that our system can be feasible in daily life. © 2019 Information Processing Society of Japan.

AB  - Persuasive messages have recently been shown to be more effective when tailored to the personality and preferences of the recipient. However, much of the literature on adaptive persuasion has evaluated the effectiveness of persuasive attempts by the direct reactions to those attempts instead of changes on the longer term (e.g. lifestyle changes). Results of this study suggest that adaptive persuasion improves attitudes towards persuasive attempts, but does not necessarily cause a change in longer term behavior. This was found through a randomized controlled trial evaluating the implementation an adaptive persuasive system in a health promotion intervention. This article provides a detailed description of this evaluation and encourages the research community to (1) become more skeptical towards the longer term effectiveness of adaptive persuasive techniques and (2) design more explicitly for longer term changes in behavior. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The persuasiveness of a narrative is increased by the audience’s engagement with it, which in turn depends on the extent to which its needs and goals are served by the narrative. This study considers whether indulging the audience’s prejudice might be a way to serve their needs and increase engagement. Two different versions of a news videoclip, one neutral and one prejudiced, were displayed in a between-participants design (N = 44). The participants’ familiarity with the topic and prejudice against it were measured, and their effect on the engagement with the two types of video was tested. The analysis shows an indifference for biased content, equally engaging than nonbiased; they also show an effect of familiarity. These first results are relevant to the current debate about biased news and the potential manipulative role of personalized content recommendations. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Behavior change is a topic that is of great interest to many people. People can use apps to exercise more, eat healthier, or learn a new skill, but and digital interventions and games are also used by policy makers and companies to create a safe environment for the general public or to increase sales. Given this interest in behavior change, it is not surprising that this topic has seen a lot of interest from the scientific community. This has resulted in a wide range of theories and techniques to bring about behavior change. However, maintaining behavior change is rarely addressed, and as a result poorly understood. In this paper, we take a first step in the design of digital interventions for long-term behavior change by placing a range of behavior change techniques on a long-term behavior change timeline. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - India is world's largest democracy and electing a right candidate in general parliament elections is not an easy task for electors. Though there are measures taken by Election Commission of India to educate electors, these information hardly reaches to the public. There is a need for basic scoring model which can measure candidate's viability and credibility. This study shows that Recency, Frequency and Monetary model can be applied to generate scores for political candidates who are contesting for elections. Based on scores candidates can be grouped into clusters to understand the behavior. These scores would evaluate candidates, thereby helps voters to make a decision. This study investigates machine learning techniques to generate political scores and predict candidate's loyalty towards party. The study also shows that XGBoost can predict candidate's party changing behavior. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Motivational interviewing is a counseling technique that works, in part, by helping people talk about changing their behavior. We describe two conversational agent-based interventions to increase motivation and confidence to promote physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption that incorporate principles from motivational interviewing. We also explore the efficacy of constraining input, so users are only allowed to express change talk in their conversation with the agent. In a within-subjects experiment we demonstrate that both interventions are effective at increasing motivation, confidence, and self-efficacy for behavior change during a single counseling session. We also demonstrate that coercing user change talk leads to significantly greater increases in confidence compared to equivalent counseling agents that allow users to express statements about not changing their behavior. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

In this campaign, Internet users can interact with a chatbot called Fabi. From a pragmatic approach to communication, we study the characteristics of the narrative supposedly based on personal experiences told by the bot as well as the interactive aspects, taking into account the circularity and equifinality principles associated with human interactions (WATZLAWICK, HELMICK-BEAVIN e JACKSON, 1992). Our objective is to analyze how chat-bots can create a “conversational narrative” with a persuasive purpose. © 2019, Superior School of Advertising and Marketing. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a shady holonovel, which is situated in the vile, short-term future. The main protagonists are two teenagers, Angela and Veronica, who are immersed in an adverse Mixed Reality online game. The girls are, at first, seduced by the comfy Sherlock Holmes-type of suspenseful narration that involves engaging mystery-solving challenges. Thereafter, the adolescent girls are fascinated by the virtual social status that the game network offers, as well as the persuasive end-reward, which will allegedly answer the ultimate existential question, “Is there life after death?”. Behind the scenes, the game is controlled by a group of anonymous, extreme transhumanists who have virtual appearances in the game as holographic avatars. To avoid lawsuits, the game is moderated by Artificial Intelligence—a curator with a virtual presence of Professor Moriarty—that aggregates the gameplay and command streams of the savage community of teen-hunters. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - With the prosperous of cross-border e-commerce, there is an urgent demand for designing intelligent approaches for assisting e-commerce sellers to offer local products for consumers from all over the world. In this paper, we explore a new task of cross-lingual information retrieval, i.e., cross-lingual set-to-description retrieval in cross-border e-commerce, which involves matching product attribute sets in the source language with persuasive product descriptions in the target language. We manually collect a new and high-quality paired dataset, where each pair contains an unordered product attribute set in the source language and an informative product description in the target language. As the dataset construction process is both time-consuming and costly, the new dataset only comprises of 13.5k pairs, which is a low-resource setting and can be viewed as a challenging testbed for model development and evaluation in cross-border e-commerce. To tackle this cross-lingual set-to-description retrieval task, we propose a novel cross-lingual matching network (CLMN) with the enhancement of context-dependent cross-lingual mapping upon the pre-trained monolingual BERT representations. Experimental results indicate that our proposed CLMN yields impressive results on the challenging task and the context-dependent cross-lingual mapping on BERT yields noticeable improvement over the pre-trained multi-lingual BERT model.

AB  - This study conducts a mapping study to survey the landscape of health chatbots along three research questions: What illnesses are chatbots tackling? What patient competences are chatbots aimed at? Which chatbot technical enablers are of most interest in the health domain? We identify 30 articles related to health chatbots from 2014 to 2018. We analyze the selected articles qualitatively and extract a triplet <technicalEnablers, competence, illness> for each of them. This data serves to provide a first overview of chatbot-mediated behavior change on the health domain. Main insights include: nutritional disorders and neurological disorders as the main illness areas being tackled; “affect” as the human competence most pursued by chatbots to attain change behavior; and “personalization” and “consumability” as the most appreciated technical enablers. On the other hand, main limitations include lack of adherence to good practices to case-study reporting, and a deeper look at the broader sociological implications brought by this technology. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Participation in colorectal cancer screening is still low among Malaysians despite the increasing trend of incidence, with more than half of the new cases being detected in the advanced stages. Knowledge improvement might increase screening participation and thus improve the chances of disease detection. With the advancement of communication technology, people nowadays prefer to read from their mobile phone using a Web browser or mobile apps compared with the traditional printed material. Therefore, health education and promotion should adapt this behavior change in educating the community. Objective: This study aimed to document the process of designing and developing a mobile app for community education on colorectal cancer and assess the usability of the prototype. Methods: The nominal group technique (NGT) was used for the content development of the mobile app. NGT involving community educationists and clinicians combined with community representatives as the target users identified relevant health information and communication strategies including features for a user-friendly mobile app. The prototype was developed using framework Ionic 1, based on the Apache Cordova and Angular JS (Google). It was published in the Google Play store. In total, 50 mobile phone users aged 50 years and above and who had never been diagnosed with any type of cancer were invited to download and use the app. They were asked to assess the usability of the app using the validated Malay version of System Usability Scale Questionnaire for the Assessment of Mobile Apps questionnaire. The One-sample t test was used to assess the usability score with a cut-off value of 68 for the usable mobile app. Results: The Colorectal Cancer Awareness Application (ColorApp) was successfully developed in the local Malay language. The NGT discussion had suggested 6 main menus in the ColorApp prototype, which are Introduction, Sign and Symptoms, Risk Factors, Preventive Measures, Colorectal Cancer Screening Program, and immunochemical fecal occult blood test kit. A total of 2 additional artificial intelligence properties menus were added to allow user-ColorApp interaction: Analyze Your Status and ColorApp Calculator. The prototype has been published in the Google Play store. The mean usability score was 72 (SD 11.52), which indicates that ColorApp is a usable mobile app, and it can be used as a tool for community education on colorectal cancer. Conclusions: ColorApp mobile app can be used as a user-friendly tool for community education on colorectal cancer. © Muhamad Fadhil Mohamad Marzuki, Nor Azwany Yaacob, Najib Majdi bin Yaacob, Muhammad Radzi Abu Hassan, Shahrul Bariyah Ahmad.

AB  - Objective Driverless technology is an essential part of intelligent transportation systems, such as environmental information perception, intelligent planning, and multilevel auxiliary driving. This technology reduces driver's work inten- sification and prevents accidents. With the development of artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles have attracted con- siderable attention in the industry and academia in recent years. In addition, a decision-making system is a core research of driverless technology. The reduction on the number of road accidents is of paramount societal importance, and increasing research efforts have been devoted to decision-making systems within the past few years. Conducting human-like decisions with other encountered vehicles in complex traffic scenarios causes great challenges to autonomous vehicles. The research on autonomous driving decision systems has important theoretical and practical values to improve the level of intelligent vehicles and intelligent transportation systems. However, the current decision-making system has several limitations, such as unrea- sonable logic, large computational complexity, and limited application scene, due to the uncertainty and randomness of the driving behavior of surrounding vehicles. To solve these problems, this study constructs a finite-state machine-based deci- sion-making system for the safety driving of autonomous vehicles in dynamic urban traffic environments. This study mainly investigates the passage of vehicles through intersections and their changing of lanes, which are the core issues of decision-making systems. Method The driver's behavior at a certain period of time is determined based on the current traffic condi- tion and risk perception. We define the primary state of the vehicle based on the driving range of the autonomous vehicle, such as driving at the intersection, driving in the driveway, and approaching the crossroads. Each primary state includes many secondary states. For example, a vehicle at crossroads may turn or keep straight. Combined with the original finite- state machine theory, a suitable traffic state machine (TSM) for intelligent systems is proposed. Considering the complexity and diversity of traffic environment, a dynamic target path (DTP) algorithm is proposed to improve the feasibility of the decision system. Combined with the TSM and DTP algorithm, we propose a DTP model based on finite-state machine for the decision system and analyze the importance of the model. For complex and diverse traffic environment, intelligent vehicles only focus on their own driving information and ignore the state of other vehicles, which cause considerable risks. Thus, we divide the awareness and conflict areas for each autonomous vehicle. The perceived range of autonomous vehicles at the crossroads is defined as the awareness area, and the reachable range of autonomous vehicles is called the conflict area. The perception area of vehicles in the driveway is defined as the consciousness area, and the range of interaction between auton- omous and surrounding vehicles is defined as the conflict area. A reasonable decision can effectively reduce the probability of accidents in conflict areas. We use the DTP algorithm to calculate the risk of decision making in restricting vehicle behavior. A fixed follow-up distance cannot consider the influence of speed. Thus, this study proposes a dynamic critical follow-up distance, which reduces the collision with preceding vehicle while following the vehicle. Furthermore, a full velocity difference model is used to avoid collision with the front vehicle of the target lane during lane change under different scenarios. Results We repeatedly perform experiments in different scenarios through the Unity 3D engine to verify the effec- tiveness of the model and algorithm. In the first experiment, we simulate a scene of an autonomous vehicle driven at a crossroad. The second experiment simulates the responses of autonomous vehicles to emergencies. The third experiment simulates the changing of lanes of autonomous vehicles in reaching their destinations. The fourth experiment simulates the changing of lanes of autonomous vehicles in increasing their speed. We simulate the lane changing behavior of autonomous vehicles during foggy days to verify that the experimental results are unaffected by poor weather conditions. Experiments show that autonomous vehicles not only can meet the driving expectation but also ensure driving safety during poor weather conditions. Experimental results show that the driving intentions of other vehicles can be obtained and autonomous vehicles can make correct decisions based on the potential risk of intersection and current traffic environment. Autonomous vehicles can change lanes based on their driving demand when driving on the driveway. In case of emergencies, the autonomous vehicle considers the special vehicle as a dynamic obstacle. After yielding the right-of-way to emergency vehicles, the autonomous vehicle returns to the original lane to continue driving. To prove that the proposed method can improve the traf fic flow efficiency, the proposed model is compared with other models. Results demonstrate that the difference among the three models is uncertain when the vehicle density is small. However, the average speed of the model is increased at most by 32 km/h and 22 km/h when the vehicle density is greater than 0. 2 and less than 0.5, respectively. The success rate of lane changing in this model is approximately increased at most by 37 percentage points and 25 percentage points when the density of vehicles is less than 0.65, respectively. Conclusions The proposed algorithm not only improves the safety and accuracy of decision making in dynamic urban traffic environment but also helps improve traffic flow saturation and reduces traffic flow. In addition, various traffic environments can be modeled by our simulation framework. Although the proposed model and algorithm are relatively simple, the assessment of potential risks can meet the planning time of autonomous driv ing. Our work provides the rules for the decision making in autonomous driving and several references for the development of intelligent transportation systems. However, the influence of vehicle types, trajectory, and road width on decision making are ignored. In the future, we will improve the current work and provide a complete and reasonable framework for automatic driving decision systems. © 2019 Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG.

AB  - This paper aims to discuss how ethics has been addressed within the persuasive technology field and to explore whether ethics is generally applied in persuasive technology (PT) or simply recognized by academics as an important perspective. The paper is based on a literature review of the past 13 years of Persuasive Technology conference papers. The themes identified from the literature review are presented along with summaries of defining works within the field which have contributed to the discussion of ethics. This is followed by a discussion and reflection on the findings of the literature review. Finally, we conclude that ethics does matter but we argue that ethics has not been adequately addressed in the field of PT and that ethical considerations regarding the rights of the designers need to be researched. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The global expenditure of healthcare systems on the management of chronic diseases is exhausting costs and efforts. This is due to the delicate nature of patients needing care constantly, as well as the chronic nature of the diseases. These two causes force patients to pay visits to their healthcare providers more frequently. Repetitive visits are countless, short in time, unmanageable and ineffective. The state of the art for managing chronic diseases focus on a shared effort between the patient and the physician in an ongoing process of collecting, monitoring, analyzing, and finally adapting the management program by the physician and the patient. Technology along with Artificial Intelligence (AI) made these processes easier. However, studies have rarely attempted to introduce models that integrated AI in health coaching plans for patients with chronic diseases. As health coaching is an integral part of some countries public health strategy. It is now used as a complementary medical intervention to shape healthy behavior change. In this paper we propose a model that puts health coaching along with AI in its core to 1. empower patients to effectively manage their chronic conditions 2. as well as to persuade them to adhere to their care management program for extended periods of time. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Despite our best efforts, pediatric obesity remains an important public health issue. Although many different approaches to address this condition have been utilized, few have achieved long-Term success. Technology is increasingly being explored as a convenient and accessible method for delivering behavioral interventions. Stephens and colleagues report the feasibility of using a behavioral coaching social chatbot, Tess, to extend a multicomponent pediatric obesity intervention for adolescents. We examine the pros and cons of this approach. Although social chatbots offer an interesting and novel method for promoting round-The-clock support, important issues and decisions must be carefully considered during the design phase to help ensure a safe environment for a vulnerable population. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Greater Bongkot North is a gas field located in Gulf of Thailand and on production since 1993. Most of the old wellhead platforms (30%) lack remote well test facilities which requires personnel visits for any well test measurement. Often, well testing in these platforms get lower priority compared to other operations in a matured field. This project implemented artificial intelligent (AI) technique to estimate gas rate from other available engineering and geological parameters. A new approach using machine learning was applied to estimate gas production rate where actual measurements are not available. Actual production well test data was used to train the model. Input parameters used were: 1. Surface facility information 2. Fluid properties 3. Production condition 4. Geological setup A blind test on the subset of historical data showed a level of confidence (R2) value of 0.93. This provided confidence to proceed with a full field pilot. A pilot was conducted during January to May 2018. The area of pilot was spread across various geological, operating and surface condition setups to reduce sampling bias. The pilot demonstrated the following use cases: 1. Improved prediction accuracy in wells with no recent test, achieving primary object of model. 2. Detection of well behavior changes: The model could detect changes in well behavior without human intervention much before the trends become obvious for engineers to detect. 3. Improved potential estimation in wells with leaks in wellhead chokes where conventional analysis followed in Bongkot is not possible due to improper wellhead shut-in pressure measurement. 4. Improved efficiency with production allocation: The conventional method requires significant time (40-80 person hours per month) to make the data available for production allocation. This can be shortened significantly by use of this method In essence, this project demonstrated the potential use of artificial intelligent to improve efficiency in a matured gas field operating under marginal conditions. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers

AB  - In recent years, e-coaching systems have played an increasingly significant role in promoting a healthy lifestyle and positive behavior change. Research efforts have grown to provide more useful and effective e-coaching systems for research or other purposes. The implementation of e-coaching systems resulting from these efforts utilizes several techniques including Artificial Intelligence (AI) methodologies. This study proposes a personalised approach to support an e-coaching system that is tailored to the user’s characteristics. A key component of this system comprises an ontological model of the user profile. The objective of this research was to propose an ontology that is able to collect and analyze the user related information as well as customize the profiles with the most appropriate coaching recommendation or materials. The ontology employed in this study was developed using the OWL (Ontology Web Language), a knowledge representation language for authoring ontologies. The effectiveness of this approach will be enhanced by filtering the information that was presented to the users. Copyright © CIKM 2018.

AB  - Literature on persuasive technology acknowledges the importance of promoting reflection within design research and practice. This paper takes up a reflection framework suggested in previous research as assisting the reasoning of researchers, designers or other stakeholders concerning values, goals, actions, and their consequences in a project. It contributes to this research by demonstrating additional evidence for the applicability of the reflection framework by applying it to a published case. This work can guide researchers and practitioners by means of issues to be considered while reflecting on as well as communicating value-related aspects in a project, so that significant value choices and the rationale for actions taken to promote them are clear. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Online users are increasingly exposed to chatbots as one form of AI-enabled media technologies, employed for persuasive purposes, e.g., making product/service recommendations. However, the persuasive potential of chatbots has not yet been fully explored. Using an online experiment (N = 242), we investigate the extent to which communicating with a stand-alone chatbot influences affective and behavioral responses compared to interactive Web sites. Several underlying mechanisms are studied, showing that enjoyment is the key mechanism explaining the positive effect of chatbots (vs. Web sites) on recommendation adherence and attitudes. Contrary to expectations, perceived anthropomorphism seems not to be particularly relevant in this comparison. © 2020 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - In the present specialized world, the word AI is itself is a significant word by its functionality, work efficiency, etc., it has totally changed the human’s lifestyle, work processing, thinking ability, concurrency, behavior change, etc. Artificial Intelligence is better applied to helping individuals from propensities. It is a clinically effective and cost-effective tool via computerizing updates for practices. Lastly, it comes about for the future as a prompt future holds tremendous promise for hybrid systems. There is no formula for intuition means not every aspect can be replicated by an algorithm but it introduced “Augmented Intelligence,” which best combines human and artificial intelligence to change human behavior. Popular visions of artificial intelligence often focus on robots and the dystopian future they will create for humanity, but to understand the true impact of AI, its skeptics and detractors should look at the future of cybersecurity. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - If the message on the social media message isn’t clear and focused, it’s unlikely to be effective, resulting in wastage of time and resources. This leads to failure of the advertisement. This leaves an impact on the health dimensions of a customer. An ideal social media message must convey the message to the audience about the product and should not give an impression to one that it is an overtly like advertising. As per Global Digital report, 2019, the number of internet users worldwide in 2019 is 4.388 billion, up 9.1% year-on-year. The number of social media users worldwide in 2019 is 3.484 billion, up 9% year-on-year. The number of mobile phone users in 2019 is 5.112 billion, up 2% year-on-year. 40% of people read and refer to articles on social media platforms to procure information on how does a patient cope up with the chronic conditions when affected with a disease.(Health Care Finance News)1 More than 1,500 hospitals across the country have their presence online. The popular social media sites used by them include Facebook and Linkedin. (WHPRMS-Wisconsin Healthcare Public Relations & Marketing Society. Wisconsin)2 Social media users are in a state where there is plethora of information on various topics. With the rise of social media platforms there has been an increasing need for research in this field as it creates more platforms for the marketers but it also faces challenges of creating unnecessary noise which leads to avoidance behaviour on the consumer’s part. In this study an attempt is made to understand the different noise creating factors such as irrelevant content, cluttered content, no emotional connect, excessive advertising etcetera to find out what exactly drives the customer to avoid a product or brand. The purpose of this study is to measure and evaluate the ways in which a consumers buying behaviour changes due to the noise created by advertisements and find prominent factors which cause such behaviour. The key observations from the study state that when a particular advertisement is placed repetitively in different platforms the customer tends to ignore the ad and subconsciously ignore the brand or product. When an Advertisement is too cluttered, customer might miss the actual part of the ad and the visual appeal also drops due to clutter. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - In this paper, we investigated the effect of a magic circle projected on the ground as a shikake. The experiment was conducted for nine days under three conditions; nothing projected, projecting a circular light, and projecting a magic circle. We observed the behavior of pedestrians and found that the magic circle had no effect on changing the direction of movement, but it did have an effect on path; pedestrians avoided the projected circle, though not the circular light. Using the idea of semiotics, we concluded that the behavioral changes could have been caused by pedestrians' interpretations of the message of the magic circle. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Lack of adherence with prescribed medications among the asthma populations exacerbates health outcomes and increases social and economic costs. Objectives: The proposed study aims to model patient-centric structural determinants of adherence rates among asthma patients and explore the potential of mobile health apps such as the TRUSTR platform to improve adherence using its power of monetary and non-monetary chatbotting and non-monetary nudges. Following specific hypotheses are tested: (1) Patient attributes, such as their age and medical condition, have significant effect on their adherence with the prescribed treatment plans. (2) Behavioral nudging with rewards and engagement via mobile health apps will increase adherence rates. Methods: The patient population (N = 37 359) consists of commercially insured patients with asthma who have been identified from administrative claims in the HealthCore Integrated Research Database (HIRD) between April 1, 2018 and March 31, 2019. Two Structural Equation Models (SEMs) are estimated to quantify direct, indirect, and total effect sizes of age and medical condition on proportion of days covered (PDC) and medical possession ratio (MPR), mediated by patient medical and pharmacy visits. Fourteen additional SEMs were estimated to lateralize TRUSTR findings and conduct sensitivity analysis. Results: HIRD data reveal mean adherence rate of 59% (standard deviation (SD) 29%) for PDC and 58% for MPR (SD 36%). Key structural findings from SEMs derived from the HIRD dataset indicate that each additional year in the age of the patient has a positive total effect on the adherence rate. Patients with poor medical condition are likely to have lower adherence rate, but this direct effect is countered by mediating variables. Further, each additional reward and higher engagement with a mobile app is likely to have a positive total effect on increasing the adherence rate. Conclusions: HIRD data reveal mean adherence rate of 59% (SD 29%), providing the evidence for the opportunity to increase adherence rate by around 40%. Statistical modeling results reveal structural determinants, such as the opportunity to nudge, are higher among younger patients, as they have higher probability of being non-adherent. Methodologically, lateralization approach demonstrates the potential to capture real-world evidence beyond clinical data and merge it with clinical data. © This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CCBY-4.0).

AB  - Artificial intelligence (AI) is currently one of the mostly controversial matters of the world. This article discusses AI in terms of the medical ethics issues involved, both existing and potential. Once artificial intelligence is fully developed within electronic systems, it will afford many useful applications in many sectors ranging from banking, agriculture, medical procedures to military operations, especially by decreasing the involvement of humans in critically dangerous activities. Robots as well as computers themselves are embodiments of values inasmuch as they entail actions and choices, but their practical applications are modelled or programmed by the engineers building the systems. AI will need algorithmic procedures to ensure safety in the implementation of such systems. The AI algorithms written could naturally contain errors that may result in unforeseen consequences and unfair outcomes along economic and racial class lines. It is crucial that measures be taken to monitor technological developments ensuring preventative and precautionary safeguards are in place to safeguard the rights of those involved against direct or indirect coercion. While it is the responsibility of AI researchers to ensure that the future impact is more positive than negative, ethicists and philosophers need to be deeply involved in the development of such technologies from the beginning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of this book is to awaken creative desire and expand the imagination of the psychotherapist and, in turn, her patient. Each chapter is meant to surprise the reader and help him see the world in a new way. Many varieties of imagination are explored -- the spiritual, the relational, the dreamworld, the aesthetic and the adaptive. The author offers space to reflect, to daydream, to remember; space to pursue goals, to make new connections; space to take risks and space to be wrong. The psychotherapist is encouraged to find her own voice, be poetic, dare to create, converse with other disciplines and, most especially, enter the world of dreams. This is all passed onto the patient as the dyad enters the intersubjective field. Both scholarly and practical, this volume elegantly and persuasively synthesizes for the first time research in many fields, including spirituality and Kabbalah, neuroscience, the arts, biology and artificial intelligence, to give an in depth and original understanding of the current pressing problems in the rapidly changing field of psychotherapy: how do we work with unconscious processes and early memories to help our patients become more imaginative, creative, hopeful and resilient, and in so doing, heal. The relationship between the body and creative imagination is fully explored as well as the disruptive effect of trauma on the imagination and how to address this. The emphasis on surprise, uncanny communication, interdisciplinary inquiry, use of dreamwork and the imagination of the body - how it spontaneously meets new challenges- all stimulate the creativity of the reader. Through numerous case studies, the author illustrates the practical implications of how this exploration allows for deeper understanding and more effective treatment. With the innovative synthesis and specific techniques the author provides, the clinician has tools to carry on the work of moving the field of psychotherapy forward as well as work ever more effectively with patients. © 2021 Leanne Domash.

AB  - This article presents a study that identifies the variables with greatest impact on the biogas and methane production over a process with thermal pretreatment, to accelerate anaerobic digestion process in sewage sludge in a water treatment plant, for a poultry processing factory, by using fuzzy logic. The designed fuzzy logic model includes 688 inference rules, with a correlation of 99.3% between prediction data against experimental data, for the biogas variable; and 97% for the methane variable. The predictions of the fuzzy logic model were analyzed with response surface models, and it is concluded that the temperature and operating time variables are mutually determining in the biogas and methane production. Likewise, this research provides a methodology for the design of an expert decision support system that allows to evaluate and optimize a mesophilic anaerobic digestion process through a previous thermal treatment in order to improve the yields of biogas and methane in the treatment of effluent sludge from agroindustry. These results propose to diffuse logic as a reliable tool to make comparisons, and predictions for operation variables management on the treatment of residual sludge with thermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper provides a systematic review of mobile apps for waste management with the main aim of uncovering the persuasive strategies employed, their operationalizations, the relationship between the number of persuasive strategies employed and the apps’ effectiveness to achieve specific target behavior. Specifically, we systematically investigated 125 mobile apps for waste management and identified distinct persuasive strategies, from the primary task support category of the PSD model. Furthermore, we classified these strategies based on the kind of waste management activities that the app was designed to support. Secondly, we uncovered how each of the persuasive strategies was implemented in the waste management apps to achieve the targeted outcome. Thirdly, we evaluated the relationship between the number of persuasive strategies employed in the apps design and the effectiveness of the apps (measured by user ratings). The results show that the apps cumulatively employed 251 persuasive strategies spread across the seven distinct primary task support persuasive strategies as follows: reduction (n = 76), tunneling (n = 9), tailoring (n = 37), personalization (n = 75), self-monitoring (n = 31), simulation (n = 7) and rehearsal (n = 16). In addition, our findings show that appropriate waste disposal, collection, recycling, and general waste management challenges were some of the waste management issues that the mobile apps targeted. Based on our results, we offer some design recommendations for operationalizing persuasive strategies in waste management app to increase their effectiveness. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Decision support systems (DSS), which are often based on complex statistical, machine learning, and AI models, have increasingly become a core part of data analytics and sensemaking processes. Automation complacency - a state characterized by over-trust in intelligent systems - has the potential to result in catastrophic performance failure. An under-investigated factor in automation complacency research is the effect that DSS might have on human learning of domain concepts. In this paper, we perform a comparative analysis of two studies of users interacting with decision aids to understand how knowledge retention is affected by the competence and presentation of a DSS. Our results indicate that while humans have the opportunity to learn and internalize domain concepts while being supported by a DSS, features that make the DSS appear more competent, persuasive, or customizable may lead a user to form incorrect beliefs about a domain. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Accelerated epidemiological transition in India over the last 40 years has resulted in a dramatic increase in the burden of cardiovascular diseases and the related risk factors of diabetes and hypertension. This increase in disease burden has been accompanied by pervasive health disparities associated with low disease detection rates, inadequate awareness, poor use of evidence-based interventions, and low adherence rates among patients in rural regions in India and those with low socioeconomic status. Several research groups in India have developed innovative technologies and care-delivery models for screening, diagnosis, clinical management, remote-monitoring, self-management, and rehabilitation for a range of chronic conditions. These innovations can leverage advances in sensor technology, genomic tools, artificial intelligence, big-data analytics, and so on, for improving access to and delivering quality and affordable personalized medicine in primary care. In addition, several health technology start-ups are entering this booming market that is set to grow rapidly. Innovations outside biomedical space (eg, protection of traditional wisdom in diet, lifestyle, yoga) are equally important and are part of a comprehensive solution. Such low-cost, culturally tailored, robust innovations to promote health and reduce disparities require partnership among multi-sectors including academia, industry, civil society, and health systems operating in a conducive policy environment that fosters adequate public and private investments. In this article, we present the unique opportunity for India to use culturally tailored, low-cost, high-impact technological innovations and strategies to ameliorate the perennial challenges of social, policy, and environmental challenges including poverty, low educational attainment, culture, and other socioeconomic factors to promote cardiovascular health and advance health equity. © 2019 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

AB  - In an epistemic graph, belief in arguments is represented by probability distributions. Furthermore, the influence that belief in arguments can have on the belief in other arguments is represented by constraints on the probability distributions. Different agents may choose different constraints to describe their reasoning, thus making epistemic graphs extremely flexible tools. A key application for epistemic graphs is modelling participants in persuasion dialogues, with the aim of modelling the change in beliefs as each move in the dialogue is made. This requires mechanisms for updating the model throughout the dialogue. In this paper, we introduce the class of delegated update methods, which harness existing, simpler update methods in order to produce more realistic outputs. In particular, we focus on hypothesized updates, which capture agent's reluctance or susceptibility to belief updates that can be caused by certain factors, such as time of the day, fatigue, dialogue length, and more. We provide a comprehensive range of options for modelling different kinds of agents and we explore a range of properties for categorising the options. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Push-notifications have the potential to reinforce positive behaviours when applied in an intelligent manner. This paper explores a method of improving the delivery process of push-notifications by extracting scrutable persuasive features and refining prediction of notification outcomes. Additionally, a method is proposed for generating recommended notifications, based on the extracted persuasive features, to maximise potential engagement for scenarios such as behavioural interventions. The results illustrate that the persuasive features extracted contributed toward improved push-notification action prediction and that the personalised persuasive notifications recommended vastly increased the Click Through Rate (CTR) of notifications. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Video contents have become a critical tool for promoting products in E-commerce. However, the lack of automatic promotional video generation solutions makes large-scale video-based promotion campaigns infeasible. The first step of automatically producing promotional videos is to generate visual storylines, which is to select the building block footage and place them in an appropriate order. This task is related to the subjective viewing experience. It is hitherto performed by human experts and thus, hard to scale. To address this problem, we propose WundtBackpack, an algorithmic approach to generate storylines based on available visual materials, which can be video clips or images. It consists of two main parts, 1) the Learnable Wundt Curve to evaluate the perceived persuasiveness based on the stimulus intensity of a sequence of visual materials, which only requires a small volume of data to train; and 2) a clustering-based backpacking algorithm to generate persuasive sequences of visual materials while considering video length constraints. In this way, the proposed approach provides a dynamic structure to empower artificial intelligence (AI) to organize video footage in order to construct a sequence of visual stimuli with persuasive power. Extensive real-world experiments show that our approach achieves close to 10% higher perceived persuasiveness scores by human testers, and 12.5% higher expected revenue compared to the best performing state-of-the-art approach. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Gamification strategies were utilized as persuasive designs for promoting physical activities in recent years. However, the “one-size-fits-all” design approach cannot be employed effectively to convince all users to engage in targeted behaviors. Consequently, personalized gamified interactions which require an adaptation of gameful experiences to the user’s preferences were applied to drive users more effectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the gamer types among the seniors, and which gamification strategies are affected by the same gamer types, thereby engaging in more physical activities. We conducted an online questionnaire to investigate the gamer types of seniors. Based on the results, seniors can be divided into three categories of gamers: Easygoing, Socializer and Achiever. For the Easygoing, they showed little preference for gamification strategies and were more difficult to drive by specific strategies. The Socializer tends to be driven by socially oriented gamification strategies, but disliked punishment in games. Furthermore, the Achiever preferred to pursue personal achievements rather than interacting with others in games. The findings of this study contribute to HCI Community with the preliminary investigations on the gamer types of seniors, arriving at a better understanding of how persuasive technology can be designed to meet the needs of seniors. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of incorporating spelling and grammar checking tools within an automated writing tutoring system, Writing Pal. High school students (n = 119) wrote and revised six persuasive essays. After initial drafts, all students received formative feedback about writing strategies. Half of the participants were also given access to spelling and grammar checking tools during the writing and revision periods. Linear mixed effects models revealed that essay quality for students in both conditions improved from initial draft to revision in terms of all aspects except essay unity. The availability of spelling and grammar checking yielded added improvements from initial draft to revision for several aspects of essay quality (i.e., conclusion, organization, voice, grammar/mechanics, and word choice), but other aspects were unaffected (i.e., introduction, body, unity, and sentence structure). The availability of spelling and grammar checking tools had no effect on holistic essay scores. These results indicate that automated spelling and grammar feedback contribute to modest, incremental improvements in writing quality that may complement automated strategy feedback. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The chief purpose of designing the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) is to provide a suitable system which is capable of eliminating the excessive impurities or pollutants found in the influent to the desired level. In this way, daily flow rates is one of the most crucial components to contribute in order to design wastewater treatment processes and plant units. So, in the present research work, various soft computing approaches including feed forward back propagation neural network (FFBP-NN), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to predict daily flow rates for the WWTP. To develop artificial intelligence models, flow rates datasets has been used over a five-year period. The performance of the proposed models were assessed for training and testing stages using statistical error indicators. Performance of techniques indicated that SVM (RMSE = 1435.4 and MAE = 1031.1) and FFBP-NN (RMSE = 1445.9 and MAE = 1036.7) techniques have provided more precise prediction of flow rates compared to the ANFIS (RMSE = 1515.6 and MAE = 1075.4) and RBF-NN (RMSE = 1501 and MAE = 1048.7). This study was proven that soft computing techniques, as robust tools, can be efficiently applied to design the flow rates in the WWTP with a persuasive degree of accuracy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: Text message-based interventions have been shown to have consistently positive effects on health improvement and behavior change. Some studies suggest that personalization, tailoring, and interactivity can increase efficacy. With the rise in artificial intelligence and its incorporation into interventions, there is an opportunity to rethink how these characteristics are designed for greater effect. A key step in this process is to better understand how users engage with interventions. In this paper, we apply a text mining approach to characterize the ways that Kenyan men and women communicated with the first iterations of askNivi, a free sexual and reproductive health information service. Methods: We tokenized and processed more than 179,000 anonymized messages that users exchanged with live agents, enabling us to count word frequency overall, by sex, and by age/sex cohorts. We also conducted two manual coding exercises: (1) We manually classified the intent of 3,834 user messages in a training dataset; and (2) We manually coded all conversations between a random subset of 100 users who engaged in extended chats. Results: Between September 2017 and January 2019, 28,021 users (mean age 22.5 years, 63% female) sent 87,180 messages to askNivi, and 18 agents sent 92,429 replies. Users wrote most often about family planning methods, contraception, side effects, pregnancy, menstruation, and sex, but we observed different patterns by sex and age. User intents largely reflected the marketing focus on reproductive health, but other topics emerged. Most users sought factual information, but requests for advice and symptom reports were common. Conclusions: Young people in Kenya have a great desire for accurate and reliable information on health and wellbeing, which is easy to access and trustworthy. Text mining is one way to better understand how users engage with interventions like askNivi and maximize what artificial intelligence has to offer. © 2019 Green EP et al.

AB  - Sustainable mobility behavior is increasingly relevant due to the vast environmental impact of current transportation systems. With the growing variety of transportation modes, individual decisions for or against specific mobility options become more and more important and salient beliefs regarding the environmental impact of different modes influence this decision process. While information systems have been recognized for their potential to shape individual beliefs and behavior, design-oriented studies that explore their impact, in particular on environmental beliefs, remain scarce. In this study, we contribute to closing this research gap by designing and evaluating a new type of artifact, a persuasive and human-like conversational agent, in a 2x2 experiment with 225 participants. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior and Social Response Theory, we find empirical support for the influence of persuasive design elements on individual environmental beliefs and discover that anthropomorphic design can contribute to increasing the persuasiveness of artifacts. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

AB  - In automated health services based on text and voice interfaces, there is a need to be able to understand what the user is talking about, and what is the attitude of the user towards a subject. Typical machine learning methods for text analysis require a lot of annotated data for the training. This is often a problem in addressing specific and possibly very personal health care needs. In this paper, we propose an active learning algorithm for the training of a text classifier for a conversational therapy application in the area of health behavior change. A new active learning algorithm, Query by Embedded Committee (QBEC), is proposed in the paper. The methods are particularly suitable for the text classification task in a dynamic environment and give a good performance with realistic test data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Persuasive technologies use a variety of strategies and principles to encourage people to adopt and maintain beneficial behaviours and attitudes. In this paper we investigate the influence of Cialdini’s seven persuasive principles on people’s choices, actions and behaviour. In contrast to related work investigating perceived persusaion, this study analyses actual persuasion. We also investigate the impact of personality, age and gender on people’s susceptibility to different message types. Furthermore, we investigate if people’s susceptibility to different persuasive messages is consistent over time. The findings suggest that certain persuasive principles have a greater influence on a person’s actions than others, with Reciprocity and Liking being the most effective. Our results differ from work investigating perceived persuasiveness, suggesting that what people perceive to be more persuasive is not necessarily what will persuade them to perform an action. Moreover, the study showed that people’s susceptibility to different principles is dependent on their personality traits, and it remains constant with time. The findings from this study have implications for future work on personalising persuasive strategies and designing digital behaviour change interventions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The rising use of the Internet and information technology has made computerized interventions an attractive channel for providing advice and support for behaviour change. Health behaviour and behaviour change theories are a family of theories which aim to explain the mechanisms by which human behaviours change and use that knowledge to promote change. Among the best-known of these theories are the Social Learning and Social Cognitive theories, the Health Belief Model, the Theory of Reasoned Action and its successors the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Reasoned Action Approach, and the Transtheoretical model. We discuss three examples of how behaviour change theories have been applied in computer-based interventions: a system to aid users to quit smoking, a decision aid for choice of breast cancer therapy, and an internet-based exercise program for reducing cardiovascular risk. We also discuss misapplication of theory, and reflect on how these theories can best be used. Behaviour change theory can be applied in health informatics interventions in several ways; for example, to select participants for a particular intervention, to shape the content of the intervention to effectively influence behaviour, or to tailor content to individual needs. Application of these theories to provide personalized advice ('decision support') is a young but promising area of research, and could inform other decision support interventions, including those that provide support for clinicians. © 2019 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - The concept of goals is prominent in information systems and also artificial intelligence literature such as goal-oriented requirements engineering and self-adaptive systems. Digital motivation systems, e.g. gamification and persuasive technology, utilise the concept of behavioural goals which require a different mind-set on how to elicit and set them up, how to monitor deviation from such goals and how to ensure their completion. Behavioural goals are characterised by a range of factors which are not the main focus in classic information systems and AI literature such as self-efficacy, perceived usefulness. To engineer software supporting goal setting, a concretised taxonomy of goals would help a better-managed analysis and design process. In this paper, we provide a detailed classification of behavioural goals and their associated properties and elements (types, sources, monitoring, feedback, deviation and countermeasures). As a method, we review the literature on goal setting theory and its application in different disciplines. We subsequently develop five reference checklists which would act as a reference point for researchers and practitioners in persuasive and motivational systems. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Diabetes Mellitus is a chronic condition that is highly prevalent in the geriatric population. Self-management plays a key role in the management of this condition. Leading an active lifestyle and having a healthy meal are cornerstones in managing this condition. Now with the advancement in Information and Communication Technology (ICT), continuous and proactive care from the affected individual's side is possible. A change in the individual's behaviour would be beneficial in pursuing physical activity and adopting a healthy diet. This paper focuses on providing a dialogue based virtual health coaching through multiple Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs), using strategies such as Motivational Interviewing (MI), Theories of Behaviour Change and Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs). The dialogues are constructed to induce a behaviour change and promote motivation in the affected subjects to work on improving their physical activity and diet plan.

AB  - Humans are still the weakest link in the cyber security system. In order to correct cybersecurity behaviour, it is important to understand both the behaviour as well as the cause of the behaviour. In an effort towards the latter, researchers have conducted empirical studies that investigate the constructs of cybersecurity behaviour. This approach has led to a plethora of constructs being proposed as the determinates of cybersecurity behavior. The large number of constructs make it difficult to decide which constructs to focus on when designing cybersecurity behavior interventions. This problem is not unique to cybersecurity behaviour. A similar problem exists in the medical domain. One proposed solution, that achieved good results in the medical domain, is the use of the Theoretical Domain Framework. The contribution of the current paper is a mapping of the constructs found in cybersecurity behaviour, to the Theoretical Domain Framework. This has been achieved by a systematic literature survey. The significance of the study is the identification and of the main behavioural constructs used in the cybersecurity domain. The findings of this research are aimed at being used as a basis when planning theory-based interventions for cybersecurity behaviour change. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Background: Digital health interventions can fill gaps in mental healthcare provision. However, autonomous e-mental health (AEMH) systems also present challenges for effective risk management. To balance autonomy and safety, AEMH systems need to detect risk situations and act on these appropriately. One option is sending automatic alerts to carers, but such 'auto-referral' could lead to missed cases or false alerts. Requiring users to actively self-refer offers an alternative, but this can also be risky as it relies on their motivation to do so. This study set out with two objectives. Firstly, to develop guidelines for risk detection and auto-referral systems. Secondly, to understand how persuasive techniques, mediated by a virtual agent, can facilitate self-referral. Methods: In a formative phase, interviews with experts, alongside a literature review, were used to develop a risk detection protocol. Two referral protocols were developed - one involving auto-referral, the other motivating users to self-refer. This latter was tested via crowd-sourcing (n = 160). Participants were asked to imagine they had sleeping problems with differing severity and user stance on seeking help. They then chatted with a virtual agent, who either directly facilitated referral, tried to persuade the user, or accepted that they did not want help. After the conversation, participants rated their intention to self-refer, to chat with the agent again, and their feeling of being heard by the agent. Results: Whether the virtual agent facilitated, persuaded or accepted, influenced all of these measures. Users who were initially negative or doubtful about self-referral could be persuaded. For users who were initially positive about seeking human care, this persuasion did not affect their intentions, indicating that a simply facilitating referral without persuasion was sufficient. Conclusion: This paper presents a protocol that elucidates the steps and decisions involved in risk detection, something that is relevant for all types of AEMH systems. In the case of self-referral, our study shows that a virtual agent can increase users' intention to self-refer. Moreover, the strategy of the agent influenced the intentions of the user afterwards. This highlights the importance of a personalised approach to promote the user's access to appropriate care. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Online product rating systems have become an indispensable component for numerous web services such as Amazon, eBay, Google play store and TripAdvisor. One functionality of such systems is to uncover the product quality via product ratings (or reviews) contributed by consumers. However, a well-known psychological phenomenon called “message-based persuasion” lead to “biased” product ratings in a cascading manner (we call this the persuasion cascade). This paper investigates: (1) How does the persuasion cascade influence the product quality estimation accuracy? (2) Given a real-world product rating dataset, how to infer the persuasion cascade and analyze it to draw practical insights? We first develop a mathematical model to capture key factors of a persuasion cascade. We formulate a high-order Markov chain to characterize the opinion dynamics of a persuasion cascade and prove the convergence of opinions. We further bound the product quality estimation error for a class of rating aggregation rules including the averaging scoring rule, via the matrix perturbation theory and the Chernoff bound. We also design a maximum likelihood algorithm to infer parameters of the persuasion cascade. We conduct experiments on the data from Amazon and TripAdvisor, and show that persuasion cascades notably exist, but the average scoring rule has a small product quality estimation error under practical scenarios.

AB  - One of the most critical issues in cybersecurity is represented by social engineering attacks. These threats have been known for years, but it is very difficult to handle them effectively, because they are strictly related to human nature. Social engineering is not just a phishing email; indeed, it is possible to distinguish several forms of attack which combine different elements, from human to social to physical and technological. According to a psychological point of view, social engineering is a powerful means of gaining information exploiting individuals’ weaknesses. Moreover, due to the mechanisms of persuasion, widely studied in literature, it is easy to imagine how complicated the management of this threat is. Appropriate training of employees, especially of key roles of the company, can be an effective antidote to social engineering. Given the current scenario and the future perspective in cybersecurity, it is clear that the approach used to manage cybersecurity requires a radical change. Currently, the preferred cybersecurity strategy is still based on technological solutions, without brilliant results, since cyberthreats keep growing. Many are convinced that Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be an opportunity for managing cybersecurity; whether true or not, it is however evident that AI has also the power to generate new threats and to strengthen the existing ones. Therefore, we should be very prudent when technologies are presented as a miracle solution for cybersecurity problems. The starting point is that technology has to be deployed under full human control. Then, critical thinking is needed to develop alternatives to improve the current approach to cybersecurity. In short, we need to develop a multidisciplinary vision of cybersecurity, involving other disciplines and assuming different perspectives. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Technological improvement in the age of information has increased the possibilities to control the innocent social media users or penalize private investors and reap the benefits of their existence in hidden persuasion and discrimination. This chapter takes as a case the transparency technology XBRL (eXtensible Business Reporting Language), which should make data more accessible as well as usable for private investors. Considering theoretical literature and field research, a representation issue for principlesbased accounting taxonomies exists, which intelligent machines applying artificial intelligence (AI) nudge to facilitate decision usefulness. This chapter conceptualizes ethical questions arising from the taxonomy engineering based on machine learning systems and advocates for a democratization of information, education, and transparency about nudges and coding rules. © 2019, IGI Global.

AB  - E-commerce is increasingly competitive and there is a constant need for new approaches and technology to facilitate exchange. Emerging techniques include the use of artificial intelligence (AI). One AI tool that has sparked interest in e-commerce is the automated negotiation agent (negotiation-agent). This study examines such agents, and proposes an offer strategy model of integrative negotiation for a negotiation-agent with a focus on negotiation agent-to-human interaction. More specifically, a new offer strategy was developed based on the integrative bargaining model, which emphasizes the importance of exchanging information among negotiators and multi-issue negotiation that includes package offers to achieve an integrative (win-win) outcome. This study incorporated an argumentation-based negotiation and the negotiation tactic of multiple equivalent simultaneous offers, which was programmed into the negotiation-agent. An experiment was conducted performing 49 negotiation-agent-to-human negotiations over three issues in online purchase tasks to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy. Experimental results indicated that the proposed offer strategy with agent negotiation can enhance the persuasiveness of an offer and the performance of negotiation outcome (human counterpart's perception toward negotiation process, opponent-agent and desire for future negotiation). The findings confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed design and demonstrated an innovative approach to e-commerce transactions. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The primary hypothesis of this paper is that recent years have seen a shift from digital advertising to post-advertising: thanks to the growing role of machine learning algorithms in communicational processes, advertising has been losing the character of explicitly persuasive addresses to assume that of friendly and open proposals and advice, or even the simple facilitation of everyday purchasing practices. The paper seeks to understand if and under what conditions the socio-semiotic and semio-pragmatic approaches developed in relation to traditional advertising can still be applied to post-advertising phenomena. The paper is divided into three parts. In the first one, the advent of the post-advertising condition is considered. In the second one, Amazon’s Alexa, an example of a post-advertising dispositive, is analyzed. In the third part, the question of the use of traditional semiotic concepts and methods for the analysis of post-advertising is examined. The final answer to this question is affirmative, but on the condition that some new conceptual and methodological tools be introduced. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - A natural conversational interface that allows longitudinal symptom tracking would be extremely valuable in health/wellness applications. However, the task of designing emotionally-aware agents for behavior change is still poorly understood. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of an emotion-aware chatbot that conducts experience sampling in an empathetic manner. We evaluate it through a human-subject experiment with N=39 participants over the course of a week. Our results show that extraverts preferred the emotion-aware chatbot significantly more than introverts. Also, participants reported a higher percentage of positive mood reports when interacting with the empathetic bot. Finally, we provide guidelines for the design of emotion-aware chatbots for potential use in mHealth contexts. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Measurement technologies provide persuasive feedback to elicit motivation. However, little is known about whether different types of standards in progress feedback yield different motivational experiences. The current study investigates effects of mastery goals with either a self-based or a task-based standard on motivational experiences. An interactive dance game was developed to provide persuasive progress feedback in the form of a self- versus task-based standard. Participants played the game and reported their experiences with it. Results showed that participants in the self-based condition responded more in terms of Improvement and less in terms of Performance compared to those in the task-based condition. This finding implies that the type of standard in progress feedback can yield different motivational experiences. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Computational persuasion aims to capture the human ability to persuade through argumentation for applications such as behaviour change in healthcare (e.g. persuading people to take more exercise or eat more healthily). In this paper, we review research in computational persuasion that incorporates domain modelling (capturing arguments and counterarguments that can appear in a persuasion dialogues), user modelling (capturing the beliefs and concerns of the persuadee), and dialogue strategies (choosing the best moves for the persuader to maximize the chances that the persuadee is persuaded). We discuss evaluation of prototype systems that get the user’s counterarguments by allowing them to select them from a menu. Then we consider how this work might be enhanced by incorporating a natural language interface in the form of an argumentative chatbot. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Background: Diabetes management apps may have positive effects on diabetes self-management. It remains unclear, however, which app features are particularly effective and encourage sustained app usage. Behavior change techniques (BCTs) and gamification are promising approaches to improve user engagement. However, little is known about the frequency BCTs and gamification techniques (GTs) are actually used. This app review aims to provide an overview of BCTs and GTs in current diabetes management apps. Methods: Google’s Play Store was searched for applications using a broad search strategy (keyword: “diabetes”). We limited our research to freely available apps. A total of 56 apps matched the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in terms of the features they offer to support self-management. We used a taxonomy comprising 29 BCTs and 17 GTs to evaluate the applications. Two independent raters tested and evaluated each app. Results: Interrater agreement was high (ICC =.75 for BCTs; ICC =.90 for GTs). An average of 7.4 BCTs (SD = 3.1) and an average of 1.4 out of 17 GTs (SD = 1.6) were implemented in each app. Five out of 29 BCTs accounted for 55.8% of the BCTs identified in total. The GT most often identified was “feedback” and accounted for 50% of the GTs. Conclusions: The potential of BCTs and GTs in diabetes management apps has not been fully exploited yet. Only very restricted sets of BCTs and gamification features were implemented. Systematic research on the efficacy of specific BCTs and GTs is needed to provide further guidance for app design. © 2019 Diabetes Technology Society.

AB  - This paper describes an investigation into the effectiveness of ArguMessage, a system that uses argumentation schemes and limited user input to semi-automatically generate persuasive messages encouraging behaviour change that follow specific argumentation patterns. We conducted user studies in the domains of healthy eating and email security to investigate its effectiveness. Our results show that ArguMessage in general supported users in generating messages based on the argumentation schemes. However, there were some issues in particular with copying the example messages, and some system improvements need to be made. Participants were generally satisfied with the messages produced, with the exception of those produced by two schemes (‘Argument from memory with goal’ and ‘Argument from values with goal’) which were removed after the first study. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are versatile tools that have the potential of being used in dialogical argumentation. They could possibly be deployed in tasks such as persuasion for behaviour change (e.g. persuading people to eat more fruit, to take regular exercise, etc.). However, to achieve this, there is a need to develop methods for acquiring appropriate arguments and counterargument that reflect both sides of the discussion. For instance, to persuade someone to do regular exercise, the chatbot needs to know counterarguments that the user might have for not doing exercise. To address this need, we present methods for acquiring arguments and counterarguments, and importantly, meta-level information that can be useful for deciding when arguments can be used during an argumentation dialogue. We evaluate these methods in studies with participants and show how harnessing these methods in a chatbot can make it more persuasive. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction: Nutritional intervention is effective in improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes but requires large inputs of manpower. Recent improvements in photo analysis technology facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI) and remote communication technologies have enabled automated evaluations of nutrient intakes. AI- and mobile-supported nutritional intervention is expected to be an alternative approach to conventional in-person nutritional intervention, but with less human resources, although supporting evidence is not yet complete. The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that AI-supported nutritional intervention is as efficacious as the in-person, face-to-face method in terms of improving glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Methods: This is a multicenter, unblinded, parallel, randomized controlled study comparing the efficacy of AI-supported automated nutrition therapy with that of conventional human nutrition therapy in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients with type 2 diabetes mainly controlled with diet are to be recruited and randomly assigned to AI-supported nutrition therapy (n = 50) and to human nutrition therapy (n = 50). Asken, a mobile application whose nutritional evaluation has been already validated to that by the classical method of weighted dietary records, has been specially modified for this study so that it follows the recommendations of Japan Diabetes Society (total energy restriction with proportion of carbohydrates to fat to protein of 50–60, 20, and 20–30%, respectively). Planned Outcomes: The primary outcome is the change in glycated hemoglobin levels from baseline to 12 months, and this outcome is to be compared between the two groups. The secondary outcomes are changes in fasting plasma glucose, plasma lipid profile, body weight, body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressures, and urinary albumin excretion. The results of this randomized controlled trial will fill the gap between the demand for support of AI in nutritional interventions and the scientific evidence on its efficacy.

AB  - The evolution of eye tracking and brain-computer interfaces has given a new perspective on the control channels that can be used for interacting with computer applications. In this book leading researchers show how these technologies can be used as control channels with signal processing algorithms and interface adaptations to drive a human-computer interface. Topics included in the book include a comprehensive overview of eye-mind interaction incorporating algorithm and interface developments; modeling the (dis)abilities of people with motor impairment and their computer use requirements and expectations from assistive interfaces; and signal processing aspects including acquisition, preprocessing, enhancement, feature extraction, and classification of eye gaze, EEG (Steady-state visual evoked potentials, motor imagery and error-related potentials) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) signals. Finally, the book presents a comprehensive set of guidelines, with examples, for conducting evaluations to assess usability, performance, and feasibility of multi-model interfaces combining eye gaze and EEG based interaction algorithms. The contributors to this book are researchers, engineers, clinical experts, and industry practitioners who have collaborated on these topics, providing an interdisciplinary perspective on the underlying challenges of eye and mind interaction and outlining future directions in the field. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.

AB  - Energy resources have acquired a strategic significance for economic growth and social welfare of any country throughout the history. Therefore, the prediction of crude oil price fluctuation is a significant issue. In recent years, with the development of artificial intelligence, deep learning has attracted wide attention in various industrial fields. Some scientific research about using the deep learning model to fit and predict time series has been developed. In an attempt to increase the accuracy of oil market price prediction, Long Short Term Memory, a representative model of deep learning, is applied to fit crude oil prices in this paper. In the traditional application field of long short term memory, such as natural language processing, large amount of data is a consensus to improve training accuracy of long short term memory. In order to improve the prediction accuracy by extending the size of training set, transfer learning provides a heuristic data extension approach. Moreover, considering the equivalent of each historical data to train the long short term memory is difficult to reflect the changeable behaviors of crude oil markets, a very creative algorithm named data transfer with prior knowledge which provides a more availability data extension approach (three data types) is proposed. For comparing the predicting performance of initial data and data transfer deeply, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition is applied to decompose time series into several intrinsic mode functions, and these intrinsic mode functions are utilized to train the models. Further, the empirical research is performed in testing the prediction effect of West Texas Intermediate and Brent crude oil by evaluating the predicting ability of the proposed model, and the corresponding superiority is also demonstrated. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

This application works as an intelligent anthropomorphic virtual relational agent that has the role of assisting older people with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2D) in medication adherence and lifestyle changes. In this paper, we focus on the development of the dialogue component of the system and in what we consider one of the main original contributions: the incorporation, in the way the dialogue flows, of Behaviour Change Techniques (BCTs), identified in the context of the Behaviour Change Wheel framework. We also describe the general architecture of the system, including the graphical component. Tests on the prototype pre-requisites were conducted with health professionals and older adults with T2D within five primary care units of the Portuguese National Health Service.

AB  - Electricity demand forecasting is an essential process for electricity planning, designing strategies and recommending future energy policies. The changing behavior of the socio-economic growth beside the incomplete coverage of the environmental impacts can make a long-term energy demand forecasting process for a specific energy network challenging. This article presents four new developed multiple regression models for Electric Energy Peak Load and the main affecting factors for Kingdom of Bahrain as a case study. Time series analysis of seven years monthly load data was conducted. The method was hybridized with Machine-learning tools to find suitable forecasting linear and non-linear models for Bahrain electricity network. Residual analysis was adopted to find the model that best fit the Peak load data. Cross validation aims to evaluate the efficiency of a predictive model. For this purpose, a new peak load data set for an eight year was gathered and tested. Results are reported to guide Bahrain electricity network forecasting needs for the next future years. The developed technique can be extended to the hybrid renewable energy system that Bahrain and other countries in the region has recently announced to adopt. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Motivational interviewing is an effective intervention for supporting behavior change but traditionally depends on face-to-face dialogue with a human counselor. This study addressed a key challenge for the goal of developing social robotic motivational interviewers: creating an interview protocol, within the constraints of current artificial intelligence, which participants will find engaging and helpful. Objective: The aim of this study was to explore participants' qualitative experiences of a motivational interview delivered by a social robot, including their evaluation of usability of the robot during the interaction and its impact on their motivation. Methods: NAO robots are humanoid, child-sized social robots. We programmed a NAO robot with Choregraphe software to deliver a scripted motivational interview focused on increasing physical activity. The interview was designed to be comprehensible even without an empathetic response from the robot. Robot breathing and face-tracking functions were used to give an impression of attentiveness. A total of 20 participants took part in the robot-delivered motivational interview and evaluated it after 1 week by responding to a series of written open-ended questions. Each participant was left alone to speak aloud with the robot, advancing through a series of questions by tapping the robot's head sensor. Evaluations were content-analyzed utilizing Boyatzis' steps: (1) sampling and design, (2) developing themes and codes, and (3) validating and applying the codes. Results: Themes focused on interaction with the robot, motivation, change in physical activity, and overall evaluation of the intervention. Participants found the instructions clear and the navigation easy to use. Most enjoyed the interaction but also found it was restricted by the lack of individualized response from the robot. Many positively appraised the nonjudgmental aspect of the interview and how it gave space to articulate their motivation for change. Some participants felt that the intervention increased their physical activity levels. Conclusions: Social robots can achieve a fundamental objective of motivational interviewing, encouraging participants to articulate their goals and dilemmas aloud. Because they are perceived as nonjudgmental, robots may have advantages over more humanoid avatars for delivering virtual support for behavioral change. © Joana Galvão Gomes da Silva, David J Kavanagh, Tony Belpaeme, Lloyd Taylor, Konna Beeson, Jackie Andrade.

AB  - Captology is an acronym, derived from Computer As Persuasive TechnOLOGY, where the instance persuasive, (lat. persuasibilibus - enticing), refers to the convincing persuasion caused by computer technology. Transitive and interactive technologies as intelligent systems, have imposed, by their persuasivity, the cult of information, after which the information became type of goods that as utilitarian resource need to be quickly and efficiently exploited. Such widely accepted fact resulted as hype, presenting perspective that approach to large amount of information and faster digestion of their content and sense will enable users to quickly get desired knowledge. Intelligent systems are ubiquitous in almost all segments of society and life, although there are no relevant researches to confirm the claims of all their acceptability. The paper presents the results of research and testing processes of computer persuasion to show that its success is primarily dependent on its factors. The design for cloud work, interactive computer programs, web, desktop and other factors directly affect the user, and its attitudes, beliefs, learning and behavior. That impact can be positive or negative. © 2017 Croatian Society MIPRO.

AB  - Integration of Communications, Navigation, Sensing and Services (CONANSENSE) [10] has made the possibilities to develop disruptive and persuasive technologies that are increasing with exponential speed and are coursing disruption of businesses, business models (BM) [5], [6] and even Business Model Ecosystems (BMES) [4] every day. Businesses have classically put emphasis on human bonds related to their BM's-but by the fast development of more sensoring and persuasive BMs increasingly run autonomously by machines, businesses have to know how these BM's can be innovated and how they can be operated to ensure their full business potential and survival. BMES and BM's have for a longtime been based and built up with human bond communication, but this can vanish within split seconds when these new technologies very much based on machine to human communication evolves. How is and will this change the bonds between humans, humans and machines and machines to machines. How will this evolvement influence humans and machines ability to 'sense', 'relate' and 'communicate' each other. The paper addresses the exponential development of artificial intelligence technologies, persuasive technologies and persuasive BMs in Business model innovation and introduce a conceptual model to future business model innovation and operation. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - While physical inactivity is a key risk factor for a range of chronic diseases and conditions associated with aging, a significant proportion of midlife and older adults remain insufficiently active. This is particularly true for ethnic minority populations such as Latino adults for whom few culturally adapted programs have been developed and tested. The major objective of this 12-month cluster-randomized controlled trial is to test the comparative effectiveness of two linguistically and culturally adapted, community-based physical activity interventions with the potential for broad reach and translation. Ten local community centers serving a sizable number of Latino residents were randomized to receive one of two physical activity interventions. The Virtual Advisor program employs a computer-based embodied conversational agent named “Carmen” to deliver interactive, individually tailored physical activity advice and support. A similar intervention program is delivered by trained Peer Advisors. The target population consists of generally healthy, insufficiently active Latino adults ages 50 years and older living within proximity to a designated community center. The major outcomes are changes in walking and other forms of physical activity measured via self-report and accelerometry. Secondary outcomes include physical function and well-being variables. In addition to these outcome analyses, comparative cost analysis of the two programs, potential mediators of intervention success, and baseline moderators of intervention effects will be explored to better determine which subgroups do best with which type of intervention. Here we present the study design and methods, including recruitment strategies and yield as well as study baseline characteristics.

AB  - Most previous research in sustainable HCI has focused on electricity consumption in domestic environments or private office spaces. Here, we address use of lighting in public areas of office buildings with the goal of understanding and measuring how calm technologies can inspire positive engagement by promoting awareness and competition. We have conducted a 15-month study with the design, deployment, and assessment of two complementary ambient apparatus (one centralized, one distributed) in an office building occupied by ICT start-up companies. Our results show that calm technology can be effective under specific conditions, resulting in a significant reduction of average electricity consumption. We also discovered that in the absence of automatic controls, approximately 25% of lighting consumption occurred during off-work hours. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - The design of an embodied conversational agent that promotes physical activity to young Chinese adults living in the United States is described, along with specific cultural adaptations performed to tailor the agent to Chinese culture. Results of a pilot study comparing the Chinese exercise coach agent to another adapted to American culture demonstrated that participants found the Chinese agent more interesting, but were more persuaded by the American agent to change their attitudes towards exercise. Overall, participants reported high levels of satisfaction with and trust in the agent, across both conditions. Qualitative analysis of interviews was carried out to examine participants' overall impression of the experience, and their perceptions of the cultural adaptations. We discuss possible explanations of our results, and propose future improvements for culturally adapted conversational agents, tailored to the Chinese community. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Technological advancements in the past decades have improved dietary intake and physical activity measurements. This report reviews current developments in dietary intake and physical activity assessment in youth. Dietary intake assessment has relied predominantly on self-report or image-based methods to measure key aspects of dietary intake (e.g., food types, portion size, eating occasion), which are prone to notable methodologic (e.g., recall bias) and logistic (e.g., participant and researcher burden) challenges. Although there have been improvements in automatic eating detection, artificial intelligence, and sensor-based technologies, participant input is often needed to verify food categories and portions. Current physical activity assessment methods, including self-report, direct observation, and wearable devices, provide researchers with reliable estimations for energy expenditure and bodily movement. Recent developments in algorithms that incorporate signals from multiple sensors and technology-augmented self-reporting methods have shown preliminary efficacy in measuring specific types of activity patterns and relevant contextual information. However, challenges in detecting resistance (e.g., in resistance training, weight lifting), prolonged physical activity monitoring, and algorithm (non)equivalence remain to be addressed. In summary, although dietary intake assessment methods have yet to achieve the same validity and reliability as physical activity measurement, recent developments in wearable technologies in both arenas have the potential to improve current assessment methods.

AB  - The GreenSoul project introduces an innovative energy-efficient platform which enhances traditional public-use buildings with various technologies' such as smart adaptors' energy analyzers' an occupant aware decision support engine' mobile applications' and interactive ambient interfaces. These enhancement aims to directly improve the interactions between occupants and energy-consuming assets in their environment. The GreenSoul framework is further enriched by the deployment of lightweight edge-computing GreenSoul-ed devices' which reduce energy consumption by cooperating with other devices' smart metering equipment and' very importantly' with eco-aware users. The decision making process is supported by a socio-economic behavioral model' which provides the necessary understanding of occupant indoor behavior toward transforming energy consuming devices into active pro-sustainability agents that inform users how energy-efficiently they operate them' provide notifications as to improve that aspect' and even adapt their own functioning to reduce energy waste. These eco-wise devices' which are coined as GreenSoul-ed Things' are explained in detail throughout this paper as well as the sensor-based architecture that supports their operation. The deployment of the framework across six pilot buildings is addressed' as well as the designed experimental setting to corroborate the potential of such a collaborative approach to enhance energy efficiency in office buildings. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Human mobility patterns can be identified through the analysis of GPS and smartphone data. This identification has been the theme of several studies, particularly in the smart cities domain. Considering that patterns identify human routines, changes in these patterns may also provide useful information. This paper reports the analysis of GPS data from a group of Chinese in Beijing from April 2009 till October 2012, identifying routine routing patterns and sudden collective breaks on those patterns. Artificial Intelligence techniques were used to identify mobility patterns. Olympic games dates and the 2009 pollution peak were identified though our method. We believe it can be a powerful tool to infer mass events occurring in any part of the world. © Copyright is held by the author/owner(s).

AB  - Theoretical and practical advances have been made within healthcare informatics. Yet, mainstream research has primarily focused on signs and consequences without consideration to causal factors. Likewise, there is an increase demand for better self-management interventions. This demand resulted from the growing elderly populations with chronic conditions that fail to adhere to self-care routine. Still, most of the Healthcare Informatics interventions have achieved short-term success; while the goal is to engage population towards long-term behavior change. This research aims to shed light on the topic of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) empowerment by building and testing a theoretical-model for building intentions to sustain a healthy behavior. With a trial of 174 responses, we found positive results and a promising approach for Empowerment based on this model. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - In recent years, due to growing interest in automated driving, the need for better understanding the humans driving behavior, and particularly the lane changing and car following behavior, has further increased. Despite its great importance, lane changing has not been studied as extensively as longitudinal behavior and remains one of the most challenging driving behavior maneuvers to understand and to predict. Drivers take into account many factors while making a tactical decision, which cannot be precisely represented by the conventional rule-based models. In this paper, we compare the results of different supervised machine learning classifiers to better understand the lane change decision of drivers using the NGSIM database. For this aim, after choosing the relevant features, the ones which contribute the most to the model were chosen with the help of feature importance analysis. Afterward, the training dataset was used to train the model with naive Bayes, support vector machines, logic regression, nearest neighborhoods, decision trees, extra trees and random forest classifiers. The accuracy of predictions for test dataset indicates that extra trees classifier, decision trees and random forest had the best performance in predicting the lane change decisions of human drivers. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - A conversational agent is one of emerging technologies that will take place in several of life domains, including e-commerce. The common features of any conversational agent in any domain is its ability to have a dialog with a human user and 24/7 available. Thus, including a conversational agent in an online business will give benefits not only to online retailers, but also e-customers. However, a conversational agent for online sales may have a different feature than a conversational agent in other domain such as health care. The main task of a conversational agent in an online sales domain is to engage and persuade e-commerce customers to buy a product. In a real life, persuasion is considered as an abstract process, which only can be achieved through a series of dialogs. In a virtual world, a conversational agent for online sales is considered intelligent if it is able to demonstrate this feature. The aim of this paper is to propose a method to demonstrate persuasion feature through recommendation and negotiation dialogs to meet e-customers' needs. A prototype of the proposed system has been implemented and preliminary results indicate the proposed method is successful. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Interactions between an intelligent software agent (ISA) and a human user are ubiquitous in everyday situations such as access to information, entertainment, and purchases. In such interactions, the ISA mediates the user’s access to the content, or controls some other aspect of the user experience, and is not designed to be neutral about outcomes of user choices. Like human users, ISAs are driven by goals, make autonomous decisions, and can learn from experience. Using ideas from bounded rationality (and deploying concepts from artificial intelligence, behavioural economics, control theory, and game theory), we frame these interactions as instances of an ISA whose reward depends on actions performed by the user. Such agents benefit by steering the user’s behaviour towards outcomes that maximise the ISA’s utility, which may or may not be aligned with that of the user. Video games, news recommendation aggregation engines, and fitness trackers can all be instances of this general case. Our analysis facilitates distinguishing various subcases of interaction (i.e. deception, coercion, trading, and nudging), as well as second-order effects that might include the possibility for adaptive interfaces to induce behavioural addiction, and/or change in user belief. We present these types of interaction within a conceptual framework, and review current examples of persuasive technologies and the issues that arise from their use. We argue that the nature of the feedback commonly used by learning agents to update their models and subsequent decisions could steer the behaviour of human users away from what benefits them, and in a direction that can undermine autonomy and cause further disparity between actions and goals as exemplified by addictive and compulsive behaviour. We discuss some of the ethical, social and legal implications of this technology and argue that it can sometimes exploit and reinforce weaknesses in human beings. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Dianrong, a tech-driven internet finance company, provides loans to a large number of people and small business users. The ability to predict fraud from loan applications is key to the company's business. Based on published literature on fraud detection techniques, features have to be extracted manually for further rule design or machine learning. But as fraudulent behaviors change over time to avoid detection, simple features or rules become obsolete quickly. Normally, we have to extract hundreds of features, which is a time and resource consuming process. This paper proposes a new way to extract features automatically from a borrower's phone network graph using neural networks, which not only overcomes the above issue, but also captures features that are hard to fake. This method has yielded strong results in reality. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - By employing individuals' behavioral data collected from routinely used devices, a more effective ‘nudging’ toward changes in individuals' attitudes and behavior can be implemented. To examine the persuasive effect on inducing prosocial behaviors, two types of system concepts were designed, namely shared value systems. We manipulated the usage context of these systems and tested the effects with two independent variables: the status of the system agent and the valence of the agent's feedback. As a result, this study revealed that users' satisfaction and intention for prosocial behavior increased after they experienced the shared value system based on the concept of self-preferential value. Interaction effects were also found between the status of the system agent and the valence of the agent's feedback. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Persuasion towards healthier eating decisions is a challenging field of research, depending on various internal and external factors. Recent advances in sensor-enriched mobile devices and wearables enable persuasive techniques to predict and influence people’s food decisions. One such technique, just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), provide users with personalized and situation-related content and thus, exploit windows of high user receptiveness for persuasion. This work’s aim is to shed light on context characteristics of such windows by analyzing 469 meal decisions as well as relating in-depth interviews on eating behaviour. We derive and describe four interesting windows in which JITAI’s could be effective: (1) Lack of Alternatives, (2) Unawareness of Alternatives, (3) Evening Cravings, and (4) Social Pressure. On the basis of these situations, we postulate recommendations for timing and content of JITAIs for healthy eating. We plan to use the findings to implement and evaluate ubiquitous nutrition-supportive interventions in the future. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Tobacco use causes serious emotional harm among smokers and it manifests in the form of mood disorders such as depression and anxiety. The effects of smoking cessation on quality of life are well documented. However, our understanding of emotional well-being of an individual in the window of quit and relapse period to provide just in time support is quite limited. In this study, we focus on social engagement, communication attributes, and emotional landscape of successful quitters as manifested in peer interactions of an online health community for smoking cessation. Further, we employed Word Embedding techniques to analyze the content-specific communication attributes in a given quit episode at scale. Results indicate users were highly engaged after a quit. The emotional index of successful quitters highlighted the fragile and complex nature of sentiments associated with a quit episode. The behavior change techniques popular before quit were ‘goals and planning’ and ‘self-belief’ and after quit were ‘feedback and monitoring’ and ‘goals and planning’. Communication genres popular before quit were ‘family and friends’ and ‘quit readiness’, whereas focus on ‘traditions’, ‘quit progress’ and ‘quit obstacles’ was high after quit. Implications for development of real-time interventions that are mindful of emotional and informational support are discussed. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this paper, we describe a new theoretically motivated application framework, Wenner, for developing tailored interactions for an exercise-oriented well-being application. The framework allows us to conduct in-lab and 'in the wild' studies to directly deploy and evaluate the effects of our interventions. We describe two systems that have been developed using the framework. The first WennerStep is an individually tailored text based approach to delivering adaptive persuasive messaging using a smartwatch. The second WennerAgent, is a virtual embodied coach who adaptively reacts to user activity with emotionally appropriate responses. We conclude with a discussion in which we describe outstanding challenges for our approach and relate this to current work on Chatbot deployments for well-being. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Businesses have classically put emphasis on human bonds related to their BM’s [www.conansence.org]. By the fast development of more sensoring, persuasive and virtual BMs increasingly run autonomously by machines, businesses should expect to be able to, build competence and thereby be capable in the future to innovated BM’s and operate BM’s in new types Business Model Ecosystems (BMES) (Lindgren and Rasmussen in J Multi BMI 4:1, 2016) in the future—where physical, digital and virtual BMES become integrated. This will investable open up to new multi business model potential but also require that businesses operate and innovate their multitudes of BM’s differently. BMES and BM’s (Lindgren in J Multi Bus Model Innov Technol 4:1, 2016; Lindgren and Rasmussen in J Multi Bus Model Innov Technol 1: 135, 2013) have for a longtime been based and built up with mainly human bond communication, but new technologies very much based on machine to human communication and machine to machine communication evolves and change the game of BMI with exponential speed. How will this change the game of Business Model Innovation (BMI) between humans, humans and machines and machines to machines. How will this evolvement influence businesses ability to “download”, “see”, “sense”, “relate” and “receive” and relate BM’s with their AS IS and TO BE BM’s. The paper addresses the exponential development of artificial intelligence technologies, persuasive technologies, virtual technologies and thereby increase the potential to create, capture, deliver, receive and consume physical, digital, persuasive and virtual BMs in Business model innovation and introduce a conceptual model to future business model innovation and operation. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Much research in computational argumentation assumes that arguments can be obtained in some way. Yet, to improve and apply models of argument, we need methods for acquiring them. Current approaches include argument mining from text, hand coding of arguments by researchers, or generating arguments from knowledge bases. In this paper, we propose a new approach, which we call argument harvesting, that uses a chatbot to enter into a dialogue with a participant to get arguments and counterarguments from him or her. Because it is automated, the chatbot can be used repeatedly in many dialogues, and thereby it can generate a large corpus. We describe the architecture of the chatbot, provide methods for clustering arguments by their similarity and value, and an evaluation of our approach in a case study concerning attitudes of women to participation in sport. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Just few years ago, many of us and rest of the world believed that social media was just fun, unproductive and pointless technical whim. But today, the use of social media has become a necessity and needless to mention, the crucial part of everyone's life, career & business. Today with the use of social media, people connect with people from whole world, express themselves, advertise their stuff & brands, and in many other forms. Although, Social Media is not just a business tool or a tool for self-promotion, it can surely contribute in a much larger spectrum and intensity to the society. Social media can help predict a Crime and its prevention too! To prevent events of crime by analyzing the behavioral changes and sentiment analysis of a person by predicting his/her thought process and line of thoughts through his/her social media is possible with the use of readily available and reliable techniques like Iterative Clustering. It can be used to provide immediate help and solution (with a collaborate team of Law Enforcement Agencies and Mental Health professionals/ Psychoanalysts) to a person who is going to risk his own life (suicide), or who is going to be a part of such criminal act. As a proactive measure, it can help provide immediate services/information to the victims and people in danger too. In this paper, an algorithm is proposed to find the person who are deviating from their normal behavior using unsupervised learning(clustering) and further classifying them in predefined categories. If the behavior change is within first threshold, it shows the change in behavior is normal and may not harm anyone. If the change is above first threshold, it shows noticeable change in behavior and need some attention by friends and family. But if the change is above second threshold value, that shows drastic change in behavior and may require immediate action. Profile of this person could also be verified by data provided with the police if any previous crime record is available with them. © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper discusses persuasive dialogue in a case where dishonesty is permitted. We have previously proposed a dialogue model based on a predicted opponent model using an abstract argumentation framework, and discussed the conditions under which a dishonest argument could be accepted without being detected. However, it is hard to estimate the outcome of a dialogue, or identify causality between agents' knowledge and the result. In this paper, we implement our dialogue model and execute argumentations between agents under different conditions. We analyze the results of these experiments and discuss about them. In brief, our results show that the use of dishonest arguments affects the likelihood of successfully persuading the opponent, or winning a debate game, but we could not identify a relationship between the results of a dialogue and the initial argumentation frameworks of the agents. © 2018 by SCITEPRESS-Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

AB  - Gamification has been successfully applied in several application domains to persuade people to reach to a certain goal. However, such persuasive technologies have concerns to keep players engaged and to sustain newly acquired behaviors for a long term. One option to tackle this issue is personalizing the gamified experience for each individual player. To this end, we developed a framework that can personalize the game content by proposing to players challenges that are tailored to their profiles and game histories. In this paper we present a Machine Learning module that optimizes the challenge selection process and the evaluation results within an on-the-field game promoting sustainable mobility habits. © 2017 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The use of Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) in the domain of lifestyle coaching has been the subject of many studies in the last decades. With ageing populations in many countries, the pressure on healthcare systems is increasing. ECAs can be a potential tool to help combat this pressure through the promotion of a healthier lifestyle among older adults, as well as through coaching and counselling of older adults on how to manage their health. Designing more lifelike and engaging ECAs is of key importance to further this goal, as this could help encourage self-disclosure by the users towards the ECAs, could make the ECAs more persuasive, and could increase engagement and enjoyment of the interactions by the users, among other things. The Council of Coaches project aims to provide users with virtual coaching done by several lifestyle coaching agents with different domains of expertise as well as varying backstories, personalities, mannerisms, motivations and looks, among other things. To work towards this goal, work has been done on character and personality design for an initial set of lifestyle coaching agents and defined initial interaction scenarios. These were inspired by literature on coaching and ECAs, videos of interactions between healthcare professionals and patient actors, conversations with healthcare professionals, and brainstorming sessions. This paper presents the work done within the project thus far and closes out by presenting our plans to address the question: What are the possible advantages and disadvantages of a multiple agent approach as compared to a single agent approach to coaching interactions with older adults? © 2018 CEUR-WS.

AB  - Speech prosody provides salient and reliable cues to facilitate social communication. What computational mechanism underlies social judgment towards “out-group” speakers is unclear. This paper focused on Speaker Confidence, a factor affecting one’s trustworthiness, persuasiveness and feeling of (un)knowing, and Speaker Accent, a factor marking one’s identity. We demonstrate that native Canadian-English listeners can recognize confident and doubtful expressions in foreign-and regional-accented speakers. A stronger impression of confidence was shown towards the native speakers. The acoustic analysis demonstrated that speakers systematically varied the mean fundamental frequency to indicate confident and doubt regardless of accent. The outgroup speakers varied more on intensity height and variation to achieve certain level of confidence. Machine learning experiments showed above-chance accuracies in all accents to classify vocal expression based on global acoustic cues, highlighting the role of acoustic regularities at utterance level in confidence encoding. Moreover, the classification rate was higher when the model trained in native accent was tested on the native than the regional accent, highlighting an in-group bias of predicting novel vocal expression of confidence from acoustic cues. These findings lend support to the dialect theory of vocal expression recognition while demonstrating a computational mechanism underlying inter-cultural/intergroup confidence perception via speech prosody. © 2018, International Speech Communications Association.

AB  - Automatic detection of persuasion in online discussion is key to understanding how social media is used. Predicting persuasiveness is difficult, however, due to the need to model world knowledge, dialogue, and sequential reasoning. We focus on modeling the sequence of arguments in social media posts using neural models with embeddings for words, discourse relations, and semantic frames. We demonstrate significant improvement over prior work in detecting successful arguments. We also present an error analysis assessing novice human performance at predicting persuasiveness.

AB  - In this chapter, we brainstorm about impact of the disruptive technology trends on IBP. We connect “what and how” Internet of things, big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence can influence future of IBP. We bring our observations into data latency and degree of customization of the products perspective. We share some of the trends on visualizations explaining how IBP can transform in life sciences, high-tech, industrial, consumer industry when connected to new technology trends. We debate how all SAP planning applications could be connected to enable faster and full digitalization of complete business environment. Finally, we brainstorm that IBP connected to IoT, big data, ML, AI generates a need for new capabilities or services. It generates a need for adoption which is not always easy. Somehow we have found it interesting that people’s ability to change behavior depends on “people networks” and technology adoption on “technology networks.” Those two abilities seem like a primary focus area in making future of IBP happening. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This paper describes a game directed to young adults and aimed at sensitizing them about potential risks of psychoactive substance abuse during nightlife events. Of interest here is that this game targets a domain in which the credibility of a persuasive intervention is particularly fragile. The design decisions and the recommendations inspiring them are described first, characterized by an effort to fit the context in which the game was going to be used. In addition, a field study with real users during nightlife events is reported (N = 136), in which several dimensions of the game credibility are evaluated and compared with the credibility of a serious information tool (leaflets) in a between-participant design. By describing this case, the opportunity is taken to emphasize the importance of serious games credibility, and to enumerate some of the occasions to improve its strength that can be found during its design to evaluation. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Due to the changing behavior of ransomware, traditional classification and detection techniques do not accurately detect new variants of ransomware. Attackers use polymorphic and metamorphic techniques to avoid detection of signature-based systems. We use machine learning classification to identify modified variants of ransomware based on their behavior. To conduct our study, we used behavioral reports of 150 ransomware samples from 10 different ransomware families. Our data-set includes some of the newest ransomware samples available, providing an evaluation of the classification accuracy of machine learning algorithms on the current evolving status of ransomware. An iterative approach is used to identify optimum behavioral attributes used to achieve best classification accuracy. Two main parts of this study are identification of the behavioral attributes which can be used for optimal classification accuracy and classification of ransomware using machine learning algorithms. We have evaluated classification accuracy of three machine learning classification algorithms. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - As data-driven innovation becomes a main trend in the energy sector, explainability of data-driven actions is becoming a major fairness issue for the residential applications, and it is expected to become a requirement for regulatory compliance. Explainability, however, often demands a sacrifice in prediction performance and affects the effectiveness of data-driven actions. In this study, we consider data-driven customer targeting in an incentive-based residential demand response program, and investigate the explainability-performance tradeoff when using simple-rule based, machine learning, and credit scoring methods. Credit scoring, that has been a popular solution in the finance discipline for over 60 years, is a scorecard based modeling method that can surely provide explainability. We first provide the detailed steps of applying credit scoring to the demand response problem. Then, we use a dataset of 14,525 households obtained from a real demand response program and analyze two prediction problems – participation prediction and behavior change prediction. The results show that credit scoring can achieve a comparable performance as the best-performing machine learning methods while providing full explainability. Our results suggest that credit scoring can be a promising explainability option for broader energy sector problems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Text mining is useful for knowledge extraction. As an effective textual data analysis technology, it has been widely promoted in many fields. In railway domain, millions of repair verbatims are recorded in the form of text. These ample but unexploited textual data can provide abundant knowledge for us to guarantee the normal operation of railway transportation and relieve maintainers’ labor intensity. However, railway switches with different number of operation times, types, in different areas and climates will have various failure cause. Hence, in order to diagnose and predict failures of railway switches quickly and precisely, it is necessary to know all failure cause of the batch of equipment in advance. In this paper, we use text mining technology to extract fault cause using a real-world dataset. To our best knowledge, it is the first research which focuses on failure cause extraction of railway switches based on text mining, and CHI method is used for selecingt features. Experiment results turn that out our method can obtains a satisfactory performance and the proposed method is more persuasive than traditional experience-based methods. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - By the 2050, it is estimated that the proportion of people over the age of 80 will have risen from 3.9% to 9.1% of population of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. A large proportion of these people will need significant help to manage various chronic illnesses, including dementia, heart disease, diabetes, limited physical movement and many others. Current approaches typically focus on acute episodes of illness and are not well designed to provide adequately for daily living care support. In our rapidly ageing society, a critical need exists for effective, affordable, scalable and safe in- home and in-residential care solutions leveraging a range of current and emerging sensor, interaction and integration technologies. Key aims are to support the ageing to live longer in their own homes; make daily challenges associated with ageing less limiting through use of technology supports; better support carers - both professional and family - in providing monitoring, proactive intervention, and community connectedness; enable in-home and in-residential care organisations to scale their support services and better use their workforces; and ultimately provide better quality of life. Deakin University researchers have been investigating a range of emerging technologies and platforms to realise this vision, which we in broad terms coin Digital Enhanced Living, in the ageing space but also supporting those with anxiety and depression, sleep disorders, various chronic diseases, recovery from injury, and various predictive analytics. A Smart Home solution, carried out in conjunction with a local start-up, has produced and trialled a novel sensor, interaction, and AI- based technology. Virtual Reality (VR) solutions have been used to support carers in the set-up of dementia-friendly homes, in conjunction with Alzheimers Australia. Activity and nutrition solutions, including the use of conversational agents, have been used to build dialogue to engage and change behaviour. Predictive analytics, in conjunction with major hospitals, have been applied to large medical datasets to better support professionals making judgements around discharge outcomes. A set of lessons have been learned from the design, deployment and trialing of these diverse solutions and new development approaches have been crafted to address the challenges faced. In particular, we found that there is a need to consider user emotional expectations as first-class citizens and create methodologies that consider the user needs during the creation of the software solutions. We find that quality and emotional aspects have to be engineered into the solution, rather than added after a technical solution is deployed. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Emotional labor in text-based chat environments will be widespread in the near future. It is difficult for novice workers to make smooth conversation with an angry customer in a customer-support working environment, one of the stressful emotional labors. In this paper, we propose a method to suppress the customer’s anger based on a communication agent introduced into customer-support work in order to facilitate smooth communication. The agent first establishes a positive relationship with the customer, and then the attitude changes to be sympathetic to the customer-support worker in order for the customer to follow sympathy and reduce anger. From the experimental evaluation, it is found that there is the possibility of suppressing the participants’ anger by this method, but the anger itself is at a higher level than in the common environment without the agent. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - We compare the behavior of avatars in videogames with the expected behavior of humans in smart environments, particularly smart urban environments. As a result of this comparison we conclude that many aspects of controlling an avatar in a game environment will also be seen in controlling human behavior in smart urban environments. We predict a convergence of videogame environments with smart urban environments where the Artificial Intelligence (AI) of the game environment can be compared with the AI of the smart urban environment that is responsible for the functioning of the smart city. Game characteristics such as immediate rewards for good behavior can also be foreseen. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Objective This randomized controlled trial evaluates the feasibility of using an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to teach lifestyle modifications to urban women. Methods Women were randomized to either 1) an ECA (content included: mindfulness, stress management, physical activity, and healthy eating) or 2) patient education sheets mirroring same content plus a meditation CD/MP3 once a day for one month. General outcome measures included: number of stress management techniques used, physical activity levels, and eating patterns. Results Sixty-one women ages 18 to 50 were enrolled. On average, 51% identified as white, 26% as black, 23% as other races; and 20% as Hispanic. The major stress management techniques reported at baseline were: exercise (69%), listening to music (70%), and social support (66%). After one month, women randomized to the ECA significantly decreased alcohol consumption to reduce stress (p = 0.03) and increased daily fruit consumption by an average of 2 servings compared to the control (p = 0.04). Conclusion It is feasible to use an ECA to promote health behaviors on stress management and healthy eating among diverse urban women. Practice implications Compared to patient information sheets, ECAs provide promise as a way to teach healthy lifestyle behaviors to diverse urban women. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Lane-changing models are a vital component of various microscopic traffic simulation tools, which are extensively used and playing an increasingly important role in Intelligent Transportation Systems studies. The applications of lane-changing models in this paper can be broadly classified into two groups: adaptive cruise control and computer simulation. Authors reviewed the development of the two themes of computer simulation: modeling the lane changing decision-making process (LCD) and modeling the lane changing's impact on surrounding vehicles (LCI). LCD categorized into six groups: rule-based model, discrete-choice-based model, artificial intelligence model, Markov process models, psychological models and hazard-based survival models; LCI categorized into kinematic wave hybrid model and cellular automata model. Then, various types of object of research, model structure, parameter calibration, and related application are elaborated. Finally, development trends and research directions of lane changing models are proposed. It can provide reference for lane changing modeling of considering traffic flow characteristics in China.

AB  - The Theory of Transforming Wellbeing (TTW) is emerging as an inevitable response to the ever-growing imbalance in our lives across the globe. Over the decades, we have been advancing technologies to make our lives better. The fundamental question still remains: with all the evolving innovations, are we gaining decent success in achieving happier and more sustainable societies? All the crucial domains of our lives continuously provide evidence of things getting disbalanced despite us making huge progress in building increasingly capable technological innovations, such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, augmented reality, autonomous vehicles, and drones, just to name a few. The TTW advances scientific knowledge and its practical applications to transform lives. Due to its strong fundament that blends technological innovations with human nature, TTW is applicable in many essential life contexts, including health, education, sustainability, equality, governance, safety, emergency, ecology, and economy. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Reflection is generally considered an effective means of achieving behavior change. A gamified approach to promoting rehearsal and reflection in a healthy eating context was studied. The game was based on the principles of the Implicit Attitude Test: by categorizing food items under positive or negative associations the players would gain points according to how fast they categorized foods under positive or negative associations. Game scores constituted feedback for reflection, and repeated playing constituted rehearsal of target responses. Experiment participants (N = 58) played the game over a five-day period. Constructs of Rehearsal (REH), self-reported questionnaire responses on Reflection (REFL) and Perceived Persuasiveness (PEPE), and self-reported Perceived Health Behavior Change (PHBC) were analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results show that PLAY moderates the REFL-PEPE relationship, and there are also significant relationships between REH and PEPE, PEPE and PHBC, and REFL and PHBC. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Background: Behaviour change is key to addressing both the challenges facing human health and wellbeing and to promoting the uptake of research findings in health policy and practice. We need to make better use of the vast amount of accumulating evidence from behaviour change intervention (BCI) evaluations and promote the uptake of that evidence into a wide range of contexts. The scale and complexity of the task of synthesising and interpreting this evidence, and increasing evidence timeliness and accessibility, will require increased computer support. The Human Behaviour-Change Project (HBCP) will use Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to (i) develop and evaluate a 'Knowledge System' that automatically extracts, synthesises and interprets findings from BCI evaluation reports to generate new insights about behaviour change and improve prediction of intervention effectiveness and (ii) allow users, such as practitioners, policy makers and researchers, to easily and efficiently query the system to get answers to variants of the question 'What works, compared with what, how well, with what exposure, with what behaviours (for how long), for whom, in what settings and why?'. Methods: The HBCP will: a) develop an ontology of BCI evaluations and their reports linking effect sizes for given target behaviours with intervention content and delivery and mechanisms of action, as moderated by exposure, populations and settings; b) develop and train an automated feature extraction system to annotate BCI evaluation reports using this ontology; c) develop and train machine learning and reasoning algorithms to use the annotated BCI evaluation reports to predict effect sizes for particular combinations of behaviours, interventions, populations and settings; d) build user and machine interfaces for interrogating and updating the knowledge base; and e) evaluate all the above in terms of performance and utility. Discussion: The HBCP aims to revolutionise our ability to synthesise, interpret and deliver evidence on behaviour change interventions that is up-to-date and tailored to user need and context. This will enhance the usefulness, and support the implementation of, that evidence. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Quality of Service (QoS) properties play an important role in distinguishing between functionally equivalent services and accommodating the different expectations of users. However, the subjective nature of some properties and the dynamic and unreliable nature of service environments may result in cases where the quality values advertised by the service provider are either missing or untrustworthy. To tackle this, a number of QoS estimation approaches have been proposed, using the observation history available on a service to predict its performance. Although the context underlying such previous observations (and corresponding to both user and service related factors) could provide an important source of information for the QoS estimation process, it has only been used to a limited extent by existing approaches. In response, we propose a context-aware quality learning model, realized via a learning-enabled service agent, exploiting the contextual characteristics of the domain to provide more personalized, accurate, and relevant quality estimations for the situation at hand. The experiments conducted demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing promising results (in terms of prediction accuracy) in different types of changing service environments. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Shock tactics in the form of controversial messages are used in advertising to solicit viewer attention and as a persuasive tactic. Persuasive games are becoming increasingly popular, however the use of shock tactics in games have not been explored in much detail. This paper discusses how three Molleindustria games use potentially controversial mechanics and messages for persuasion. In a user study, we explored how the perceived controversy of these games influenced their efficacy. Overall, the results show that perceived controversy correlates significantly with the percentage of their study compensation participants were willing to donate. The findings point towards shock tactics as a potential tool for the design and evaluation of persuasive games. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - We consider two teams of agents engaging in a debate to persuade an audience of the acceptability of a central argument. This is modelled by a bipartite abstract argumentation framework with a distinguished topic argument, where each argument is asserted by a distinct agent. One partition defends the topic argument and the other partition attacks the topic argument. The dynamics are based on flag coordination games: in each round, each agent decides whether to assert its argument based on local knowledge. The audience can see the induced sub-framework of all asserted arguments in a given round, and thus the audience can determine whether the topic argument is acceptable, and therefore which team is winning. We derive an analytical expression for the probability of either team winning given the initially asserted arguments, where in each round, each agent probabilistically decides whether to assert or withdraw its argument given the number of attackers. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Conversational agents stand to play an important role in supporting behavior change and well-being in many domains. With users able to interact with conversational agents through both text and voice, understanding how designing for these channels supports behavior change is important. To begin answering this question, we designed a conversational agent for the workplace that supports workers' activity journaling and self-learning through reflection. Our agent, named Robota, combines chat-based communication as a Slack Bot and voice interaction through a personal device using a custom Amazon Alexa Skill. Through a 3-week controlled deployment, we examine how voice-based and chat-based interaction affect workers' reflection and support self-learning. We demonstrate that, while many current technical limitations exist, adding dedicated mobile voice interaction separate from the already busy chat modality may further enable users to step back and reflect on their work. We conclude with discussion of the implications of our findings to design of workplace self-tracking systems specifically and to behavior-change systems in general. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - While pathologies of the central nervous system (CNS) are often associated with neuropsychological deficits, adequate quantification and monitoring of such deficits remains challenging. Due to their complex nature, comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations are needed, which are time-consuming, resource-intensive and do not adequately account for daily or hourly fluctuations of a patient’s condition. Innovative approaches are required to improve the diagnostics and continuous monitoring of brain function, ideally in the form of a simple, objective, time-saving and inexpensive tool that overcomes the aforementioned weaknesses of conventional assessments. As smartphones are widely used and integrated in virtually every aspect of our lives, their potential regarding the acquisition of data representing an individual’s behavior and health is enormous. Alterations in a patient’s physical or mental health state may be recognized as behavioral deviation from the physiological range of the normal population, but also in comparison to the patient’s individual baseline assessment. As smartphone-based assessment allows for continuous monitoring and therefore accounts for possible fluctuations or transiently occurring abnormalities in a patient’s neurologic state, it may serve as a surveillance tool in the acute setting for early recognition of complications, or in the long-term outpatient setting to quantify rehabilitation or disease progress. This may be particularly interesting for regions of the world where healthcare resources for comprehensive clinical/neuropsychological examinations are insufficient or distances to healthcare providers are long. Here, we highlight the potential of smartphone-based behavioral monitoring in healthcare.

AB  - Irony is a versatile seasoning for language that is just as useful for sugaring insults as for salting compliments. It is a flavoring that adds bite to much of our online interaction, making its computational analysis – recognition and understanding – a necessity for affective language processing. If the computational generation of irony is a harder sell, it is perhaps because this mode of communication is so often vexing for humans too. However, an artificial fluency with irony is as desirable as fluency in any form of creative language, from metaphor and analogy to humour and persuasive argumentation. We explore two distinct approaches to irony generation in this paper: knowledge-based generation ab initio, and a more shallow approach we name ‘mere re-generation.’ We consider the relative merits of each, conduct a user evaluation, and demonstrate some practical uses. © ICCC 2018.All rights reserved.

AB  - It is little known that Schopenhauer (1788–1860) made thorough use of Euler diagrams in his works. One specific diagram depicts a high number of concepts in relation to Good and Evil. It is, hence, uncharacteristic as logicians of that time seldom used diagrams for more than three terms (the number demanded by syllogisms). The objective of this paper is to make sense of this diagram by explaining its function and inquiring whether it could be viewed as an early serious attempt to construct complex diagrams. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - How can the impact of Health Education programs promoting physical activity be analysed? One common way with learning programs is to conduct pre- and post-tests and measure whether/how target knowledge has evolved. In the case of physical activity, unobtrusive accelerometers can capture detailed data about people’s movements, but the challenge is to extract information from these raw data to investigate whether/how physical activity behaviours have evolved. This paper presents a methodology to do so, by extracting bouts of physical activity of specific intensity levels and of various lengths, and by using these as features to cluster students’ daily behaviours before and after intervention. This approach enables a more insightful analysis of the physical activity behaviours of the participants, and point to the nature of behaviour changes, if present. We illustrate this methodology with pre- and post-test data collected in the context of an e-learning program aimed at educating school children about healthy behaviours, with a focus on reaching recommended levels of daily physical activity: the pre- and post-tests were carried out by measuring unobtrusively and continuously their physical activity for five consecutive school days using research-grade accelerometers (GENEActiv).

AB  - Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting millions of people worldwide. Laboratory research and longitudinal clinical studies have helped to reveal various information about the disease but the exact causal process is not known yet. Patterns from alteration of neurochemicals (e.g., glutathione depletion, etc.), hippocampal atrophy, and brain effective connectivity loss as well as associated behavioral changes have generated important characteristic features. These imaging-based readouts and neuropsychological outcomes along with supervised clinical review are critical for developing a comprehensive artificial intelligence strategy for early predictive AD diagnosis and therapeutic development. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Argumentation theory provides foundations for distributed non- monotonic reasoning in the form of inter-agent dialogues. However current dialogue models do not accommodate reasoning about possibly conflicting preferences used in arbitrating amongst attacking arguments. We provide a framework for persuasion dialogues that accommodates such reasoning. Agents exchange locutions that implicitly define an ASPIC+ theory consisting of rules and premises. The theory’s defined arguments instantiate an extended argumentation framework (EAF) that accommodates arguments claiming preferences over other arguments, so that evaluation of the EAF’s justified arguments determines the outcome of the dialogue. We also evaluate the outcome of a dialogue based on the dialectical status of moves in the dialogue, propose restrictions on dialogue moves and conjecture correspondences between the two outcome definitions. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - The ability to engage the user in a conversation and the credibility of the system are two fundamental characteristics of virtual coaches. In this paper, we present the architecture of a conversational e-coach for promoting healthy lifestyles in older age, developed in the context of the NESTORE H2020 EU project. The proposed system allows multiple access points to a conversational agent via different interaction modalities: a tangible companion that embodies the virtual coach will leverage voice and other non-verbal cues in the domestic environment, while a mobile app will integrate a text-based chat for a ubiquitous intervention. In both cases, the conversational agent will deliver personalized interventions based on behavior change models and will promote trust by means of emotionally rich conversations. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - Gamification in the era of chatbots is a novel way to engage users with the chatbot application. When developing a gamified chatbot system, there are factors related to user types (ages, gender and others) that we should consider to effectively integrate the game elements into the chatbot while targeting the right audience. In this study, we discuss the development of an educational chatbot game 'CiboPoli', that's specialised in teaching children about healthy lifestyle through an interactive social game environment. The presented game is based on a paper prototype that we developed to teach primary school students about healthy diet and food waste management. The current approach will be more engaging and pose AI capabilities. This is still a work in progress and we plan to improve its design by incorporating additional components, such as dialog management module, user-specific knowledge module or machine learning module. Future work will be devoted to integrating machine learning to automatically identify learners emotions and provide personalised suggestions. Moreover, we tested the initial prototype with school students and found that it outperforms the paper version. Future work will focus on applying it to other domains and demographics. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - Despite technological advancements in assistive technologies, studies show high rates of non-use. Because of the rising numbers of people with disabilities, it is important to develop strategies to increase assistive technology acceptance. The current research investigated the use of an artificial agent (embedded into a system) as a persuasive behavior model to influence individuals’ technology acceptance beliefs. Specifically, we examined the effect of agent-delivered behavior modeling vs. two non-modeling instructional methods (agent-delivered instructional narration and no agent, text-only instruction) on individuals’ computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of use of an assistive technology. Overall, the results of the study confirmed our hypotheses, showing that the use of an artificial agent as a behavioral model leads to increased computer self-efficacy and perceived ease of use of a system. The implications for the inclusion of an artificial agent as a model in promoting technology acceptance are discussed. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) has continuously been used as a method in the fields of medical and clinical research to improve patients’ health outcomes. However, the evidence of its effectiveness in self-health management through strengthening one’s subconscious mind to change his/her health behavior is not well supported. This paper will use a design science method to describe The Design of Personalized Artificial Intelligence Diagnosis and the Treatment of Health Management Systems Simulating the Role of General Practitioners (AIHMS) that assists in providing tailored interventions to enhance health related behavioral changes. Findings from AI healthcare studies have shown promising insights, particularly in improving self-management and some health outcomes. In fact, AIHMS has not only promoted the happiness of patients, but eased the relationship between doctors and patients, improved patient’s satisfaction and other benefits, with far-reaching theoretical and practical implications. Furthermore, AI technology service innovation will improve the wellbeing of patients. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Argumentative persuasion usually employs one of the three persuasion strategies: Ethos, Pathos or Logos. Several approaches have been proposed to model persuasive agents, however, none of them explored how the choice of a strategy impacts the mental states of the debaters and the argumentation process. We conducted a field experiment with real debaters to assess the impact of the mental engagement and emotions of the participants, as well as of the persuasiveness power of the arguments exchanged during the debate. Our results show that the Pathos strategy is the most effective in terms of mental engagement. Copyright © 2018, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Using emotional expressions in a conversation is an efficient way to convey one’s thoughts. Emotional expressions of the persuader have a strong impact to the recipient’s attitude in a negotiation. Studies for a persuasive dialog system, which tries to lead users to the system’s specific goals, show that incorporating users’ emotional factors can enhance the system to persuade users. However, in a human-human negotiation, the persuader can have better outcomes not only through considering the emotion of the other person but also through expressing his or her own emotions. In this paper, we propose an example-based persuasive dialog system with expressive emotion capability. The proposed dialog system is trained by newly collected corpus with statistical learning. Emotional states and the user’s acceptance rate of the persuasion are annotated. Experimental results through crowdsourcing suggested that the system using emotional expressions has a potential to persuade some users who prefer to be used emotional expressions, effectively. © 2018, Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Objective Verbal and non-verbal behaviors, which are known as “relational contextualization cues” relay information about relationships and how they are structured. We developed a computer-simulated provider conducting an informed consent process for clinical research to investigate the effects of a provider's alignment of interests with a patient, the research team, or a neutral party on patient trust in the provider. Methods Participants (N = 43) interacted with a simulated provider for a research informed consent process in a three-arm, counterbalanced, within-subjects experiment. Participants reported their trust in the simulated provider after each treatment. Results Participants successfully recognized the alignment manipulation, and perceived the patient-aligned provider as more trustworthy than the other providers. Participants were also more satisfied with the patient-aligned provider, liked this provider more, expressed more desire to continue working with this provider, and stated that they were significantly more likely to sign the consent form after interacting with this provider compared to the other two. Conclusion Relational contextualization that aligns with the patient increases trust, satisfaction, and willingness to enroll in the context of research informed consent. Practice implications Health providers should align themselves with patients’ interests. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In automated health services based on text and voice interfaces, there is need to be able to understand what the user is talking about, and what is the attitude of the user towards a subject. Typical machine learning methods for text analysis require a lot of annotated data for the training. This is often a problem in addressing specific and possibly very personal health care needs. In this paper we propose an active learning algorithm for the training of a text classifier for a conversational therapy application in the area of health behavior change. A new active learning algorithm, Query by Embedded Committee (QBEC), is proposed in the paper. The methods is particularly suitable for the text classification task in a dynamic environment and gives a good performance with realistic test data. © CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cultural congruity between patients and healthcare providers has been demonstrated to be an important factor in maximizing the efficacy of healthcare. Similarly, the targeting and tailoring of health messages for a particular culture has been shown to increase their impact on patients, compared to generic messages. These findings indicate the importance of culture in designing messages, interventions, and care protocols intended to increase population health, especially for minority cultures for which generic messages and interventions represent a cultural mismatch. As our healthcare processes become automated—to increase access, decrease cost, and improve care—attention to cultural cues and their effects becomes more and more important. While cultural cues can be encoded in very subtle ways in any computer interface, embodied conversational agents provide a health communication medium in which culture can be explicitly encoded in order to achieve the same benefits of cultural congruity and tailoring seen in human-human interactions. In this chapter we review research on cultural congruity and tailoring in traditional medicine, and how these effects can be achieved with conversational agents. We present the results of an empirical study of the effects of cultural and linguistic tailoring of an animated exercise coach on user ratings of the coach’s trustworthiness and persuasiveness. We then review two large-scale systems for longitudinal health behavior change intervention which feature conversational agent-based health coaches tailored for specific minority cultures: Latinos in Northern California and those in the Boston area. We also review results from a pilot study on the effectiveness of one of these systems in promoting physical activity over a four-month period of time. We close the chapter with a research agenda and challenges for future work in culturally-tailored conversational healthcare agents. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - In this paper we present design concepts for a chatbot than can be used for argument acquisition. We call the acquisition of arguments by means of a chatbot argument harvesting. The chatbot asks the user for his or her arguments on a topic of interest. It can also be used to harvest counterargument, values, preferences, as well as information about the user like his/her personal circumstances. The harvested arguments and other attributes have various applications from the instantiation of argument graphs to the development of computational persuasion systems. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Background: Hypertension is a major cause of morbidity and mortality but frequently remains uncontrolled. A smartphone application that provides coaching regarding home blood pressure monitoring and other aspects of hypertension self-care and related behavior change may be a scalable way to help manage hypertension. Methods/design: The Smart Hypertension Control Study is a prospective, randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a hypertension personal control program (HPCP), which consists of an automated artificial intelligence smartphone application that provides individualized support and coaching to promote home monitoring and healthy behavior changes related to hypertension self-management. Enrolled adults with uncontrolled hypertension will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to the HPCP with home blood pressure monitoring or to home monitoring alone. We plan to enroll 350 participants, with a target of 300 participants with complete six-month follow-up data. The primary study outcome will be systolic blood pressure at six months. Additional outcomes include measures of antihypertensive medication adherence, home blood pressure monitoring practices, self-management practices, weight, and self-reported health behaviors. Conclusion: The Smart Hypertension Control Study will evaluate blood pressure and hypertension self-management behavior outcomes in participants with uncontrolled hypertension exposed to a smartphone-based hypertension health coaching application in addition to home blood pressure monitoring compared to those exposed to home blood pressure monitoring alone. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Virtual agents can be integrated in e-learning environments to encourage learning behavior through persuasive and motivational messages. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of agent's message-frame, i.e., gainframe and loss-frame on cognitive load and intrinsic motivation of learners interacting with motivational virtual agent in an e-learning environment. Based on regulatory fit theory, this study also investigated if matching a learner's regulatory focus orientation i.e., promotion-focus or prevention-focus to compatible agent's message-frame i.e., gain-frame or loss-frame would produce cognitive and motivational benefits. The results of our experiment (n=210) revealed that the motivational virtual agent that utilized lossframe message to encourage learning behavior induced significantly higher germane cognitive load and intrinsic motivation in learners, as compared to the gain-frame motivational virtual agent. It was also shown that when the virtual agent used gain-frame message to encourage learning behavior, chronic promotion-focus learners experienced greater intrinsic motivation in e-learning than did chronic prevention-focus learners. Implications and suggestions for further research are discussed in this paper. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Educating society concerning stigmatized conditions, such as the eating disorder Anorexia Nervosa (AN), aims to change attitudes that will encourage individuals with AN to recognize their condition and decide to seek help. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the most important contemporary directions of development in the field of artificial intelligence is to equip AI systems with emotional intelligence. This work is part of this trend. The paper presents a mathematical model that allows us to describe changes in players’ emotional states as a response to dialogue actions. To this end, we use the paradigm of dialogue games and propose a method of rating locutions. The method is inspired by the affective rating system SAM which uses Mehrabian’s PAD space which distinguishes emotions because of three attributes: Pleasantness (valence) (P), Arousal (A), and Dominance (D). Emotions that are analyzed are taken from Ekman’s model with five universally accepted labels: fear, disgust, anger, sadness, and joy. In addition, we describe the emerging tool for the realization of dialogue games with emotional reasoning. This tool is the basis for designing a system for verifying the properties of dialog protocols. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Words in Freedom is a design project aimed at artists, activists, and others that draws from research on the manifesto to create a studio environment or ‘Manifesto Machine’. Drawing primarily on the sub-disciplines of Design for Good and Critical Design, this project seeks to enhance conscious self-expression and empowerment while questioning design’s inbuilt optimism and the effects of automation on human agency. When we automate for improved performance, what do we lose in the process? Do the benefits outweigh the loss of agency? How can technology aid expression without over determining it? Ultimately, Words in Freedom seeks to create a collaborative writing environment that strikes the right balance between freedom and constraint, agency and inspiration. We trace the manifesto’s return to prominence in digital form, arguing for its usefulness as a potent discursive artifact. We then describe the Manifesto Machine as a set of tools to help write and disseminate persuasive manifestos, introducing our initial prototype (or probe, as in Reflective Design) as a means of conducting our primary research, engaging with groups and understanding social practices around declaring principles and beliefs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - We employ machine learning techniques to identify common characteristics and features from cases in the US courts of appeals that contribute in determining dissent. Show that our models were able to predict vote alignment with an average F1 score of 73%. Exploration into which factors help in arriving at this accuracy show that the length of the opinion, the number of citations in the opinion, and voting valence, are all key factors. ese results indicate that certain high level characteristics of a case can be used to predict dissent. We also explore the inuence of dissent using seating paerns of judges, and our results show that raw counts of how oen two judges sit together plays a role in dissent. In addition to the dissents, we analyze the notion of memetic phrases occurring in opinions - phrases that see a small spark of popularity but eventually die out in usage - and try to correlate them to dissent. © 2017 ACM.

AB  - To optimize effectiveness of persuasive technology, understanding also psychophysiological processes of persuasion is crucial. The current research explored cardiovascular reactions to persuasive messages using four persuasion principles proposed by Cialdini (authority, scarcity, consensus, and commitment) in a laboratory experiment. The study had a randomized within-subject design. Participants (N = 56) were presented with 4 × 14 persuasive messages while cardiovascular reactions were measured with electrocardiography. Findings showed significantly different cardiovascular arousal regarding inter-beat interval and standard deviations of normal-to-normal heart rate peaks during persuasive principles compared to baseline or startle reflex. Results show no relation between cardiovascular arousal and self-reported susceptibility to persuasion. However, during the presentation of authority-based persuasion messages, data of the first stimulus condition showed a negative correlation between self-reported susceptibility and inter-beat interval reactivity. This explorative study advances our knowledge of psychophysiological processes underlying persuasion and suggested that at least certain persuasive principles may relate to physiological changes. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Video tracking based biological early warning system achieved a great progress with advanced computer vision and machine learning methods. Ability of video tracking of multiple biological organisms has been largely improved in recent years. Video based behavioral monitoring has become a common tool for acquiring quantified behavioral data for aquatic risk assessment. Investigation of behavioral responses under chemical and environmental stress has been boosted by rapidly developed machine learning and artificial intelligence. In this paper, we introduce the fundamental of video tracking and present the pioneer works in precise tracking of a group of individuals in 2D and 3D space. Technical and practical issues suffered in video tracking are explained. Subsequently, the toxic analysis based on fish behavioral data is summarized. Frequently used computational methods and machine learning are explained with their applications in aquatic toxicity detection and abnormal pattern analysis. Finally, advantages of recent developed deep learning approach in toxic prediction are presented. © 2018 Chunlei Xia et al.

AB  - In this work we analyse a set of persuasive essays, which were marked and graded with respect to their overall quality. Additionally, we performed a small-scale machine learning experiment incorporating features from the argumentative analysis in order to automatically classify good and bad essays on a four-point scale. Our results indicate that bad essays suffer from more than just incomplete argument structures, which is already visible using simple surface features. We show that good essays distinguish themselves in terms of the amount of argumentative elements (such as major claims, premises, etc.) they use. The results, which have been obtained using a small corpus of essays in German, indicate that information about the argumentative structure of a text is helpful in distinguishing good and bad essays. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Type 2 diabetes is the most expensive chronic disease in the United States. Two-thirds of US adults have prediabetes or are overweight and at risk for type 2 diabetes. Intensive in-person behavioral counseling can help patients lose weight and make healthy behavior changes to improve their health outcomes. However, with the shortage of health care providers and associated costs, such programs do not adequately service all patients who could benefit. The health care system needs effective and cost-effective interventions that can lead to positive health outcomes as scale. This study investigated the ability of conversational artificial intelligence (AI), in the form of a standalone, fully automated text-based mobile coaching service, to promote weight loss and other health behaviors related to diabetes prevention. This study also measured user acceptability of AI coaches as alternatives to live health care professionals. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate weight loss, changes in meal quality, and app acceptability among users of the Lark Weight Loss Health Coach AI (HCAI), with the overarching goal of increasing access to compassionate health care via mobile health. Lessons learned in this study can be applied when planning future clinical trials to evaluate HCAI and when designing AI to promote weight loss, healthy behavior change, and prevention and self-management of chronic diseases. Methods: This was a longitudinal observational study among overweight and obese (body mass index ≥25) participants who used HCAI, which encourages weight loss and healthy diet choices through elements of cognitive behavioral therapy. Weight loss, meal quality, physical activity, and sleep data were collected through user input and, for sleep and physical activity, partly through automatic detection by the user's mobile phone. User engagement was assessed by duration and amount of app use. A 4-question in-app user trust survey assessed app usability and acceptability. Results: Data were analyzed for participants (N=70) who met engagement standards set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for Diabetes Prevention Program, a clinically proven weight loss program focused on preventing diabetes. Weight loss (standard error of the mean) was 2.38% (0.69%) of baseline weight. The average duration of app use was 15 (SD 1.0) weeks, and users averaged 103 sessions each. Predictors of weight loss included duration of AI use, number of counseling sessions, and number of meals logged. Percentage of healthy meals increased by 31%. The in-app user trust survey had a 100% response rate and positive results, with a satisfaction score of 87 out of 100 and net promoter score of 47. Conclusions: This study showed that use of an AI health coach is associated with weight loss comparable to in-person lifestyle interventions. It can also encourage behavior changes and have high user acceptability. Research into AI and its application in telemedicine should be pursued, with clinical trials investigating effects on weight, health behaviors, and user engagement and acceptability. © Natalie Stein, Kevin Brooks.

AB  - The experiments showed that when using various control algorithms, it is possible to significantly reduce the time of the model execution and the amount of memory expended, and increase the responsiveness of the model for control events. Using the new proposed version of the 'event calendar', you can significantly reduce the time it takes to test the model for performance. Using the agent at run time will allow to observe how the model itself and its behavior change. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Films are an upgraded version of books in this virtual age. Films depict many issues and portray reality through imagination and innovation. They depict the happenings of the society in a persuasive way with visual effects. Often, culture of a community, religious practices, faith, beliefs etc., is portrayed through films. A postmodern film has the ability to foresee and predict future and one example for this is the concept of virtual milieu in the real world which is depicted in the film Her. From the commonly used social media to the advanced level of software’s everything is leads mankind to the world of hyper reality which is redefining the concept of existing culture. The objective of this research article is to highlight the elements of Artificial Intelligence and hyper reality in the chosen film and to bring out the impacts and influences of such films in society leading to a falsified cultural relativism. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc.

AB  - Digital technology can make cities smart. City managements can make use of information that can be extracted from databases in which data is collected about energy consumption, traffic behavior, waste management, human behavior in public environments and opinions of the general public, for example as they can be collected from social media. But can this digital technology and the data collected from it help to make living in a city more enjoyable? How can digital technology and information provided by digital technology make cities playful, allow citizens to engage in playful and entertaining activities that help to enjoy their daily and sometimes boring activities such as travelling, working, child care, house-keeping? This paper investigates how sensors and actuators in an urban environment can be introduced and used to design playful applications. We observe how ideas about playable cities emerge and develop. Interactive digital installations can provide fun, urban games can provide fun, but the experiences obtained from them can as well provide urban designers, architects, gamification and public media designers about public behavior and preferences. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - There is a growing literature critiquing the unreflective application of big data, predictive analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine-learning techniques to social problems. Such methods may reflect biases rather than reasoned decision making. They also may leave those affected by automated sorting and categorizing unable to understand the basis of the decisions affecting them. Despite these problems, machinelearning experts are feeding judicial opinions to algorithms to predict how future cases will be decided. We call the use of such predictive analytics in judicial contexts a jurisprudence of behaviourism as it rests on a fundamentally Skinnerian model of cognition as a black-boxed transformation of inputs into outputs. In this model, persuasion is passé; what matters is prediction. After describing and critiquing a recent study that has advanced this jurisprudence of behaviourism, we question the value of such research. Widespread deployment of prediction models not based on the meaning of important precedents and facts may endanger the core rule-of-law values. © 2018 University Of Toronto Press.

AB  - Explainable recommendation and search attempt to develop models or methods that not only generate high-quality recommendation or search results, but also intuitive explanations of the results for users or system designers, which can help to improve the system transparency, persuasiveness, trustworthiness, and effectiveness, etc. This is even more important in personalized search and recommendation scenarios, where users would like to know why a particular product, web page, news report, or friend suggestion exists in his or her own search and recommendation lists. The motivation of the workshop is to promote the research and application of Explainable Recommendation and Search, under the background of Explainable AI in a more general sense. Early recommendation and search systems adopted intuitive yet easily explainable models to generate recommendation and search lists, such as user-based and item-based collaborative filtering for recommendation, which provide recommendations based on similar users or items, or TF-IDF based retrieval models for search, which provide document ranking lists according to word similarity between different documents. However, state-of-the-art recommendation and search models extensively rely on complex machine learning and latent representation models such as matrix factorization or even deep neural networks, and they work with various types of information sources such as ratings, text, images, audio or video signals. The complexity nature of state-of-the-art models make search and recommendation systems as blank-boxes for end users, and the lack of explainability weakens the persuasiveness and trustworthiness of the system for users, making explainable recommendation and search important research issues to the IR community. In a broader sense, researchers in the whole artificial intelligence community have also realized the importance of Explainable AI, which aims to address a wide range of AI explainability problems in deep learning, computer vision, automatic driving systems, and natural language processing tasks. As an important branch of AI research, this further highlights the importance and urgency for our IR/RecSys community to address the explainability issues of various recommendation and search systems. © 2018 ACM.

AB  - This paper shows how Whately’s view of presumption as a preoccupation of the ground plays an indispensable role in the study of persuasive aspects of appeals to authority and deference. This is done by showing how important connections among arguments from authority, presumption, burden of proof, and deference can be precisely defined, combined, and fitted into a formal argumentation framework for responding to arguments from expert opinion and analyzing the ad verecundiam fallacy. As the inquiry into Whately’s ideas also reveals links between Aristotelian topics and dialectic later brought out by Perelman, it constitutes an illustration showing how the study of various historically important rhetorical ideas allows us to develop contemporary models of arguments. © 2018 by The International Society for the History of Rhetoric.

AB  - Argument persuasiveness is one of the most important dimensions of argumentative essay quality, yet it is little studied in automated essay scoring research. Using a recently released corpus of essays that are simultaneously annotated with argument components, argument persuasiveness scores, and attributes of argument components that impact an argument's persuasiveness, we design the first set of neural models that predict the persuasiveness of an argument and its attributes in a student essay, enabling useful feedback to be provided to students on why their arguments are (un)persuasive in addition to how persuasive they are. © 2018 International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Regular physical activity contributes to higher levels of well-being, healthy aging and prevention of several chronic diseases such as depression. To establish or change behaviours concerning physical activity, social contagion may play a role. The aim of this study was to model the contagion of physical activity based on empirical Twitter data and to assess the role of homophily within this contagion. To model the contagion of physical activity, an adaptive temporal-causal network model was designed, and accordingly, the parameters of the model were tuned using empirical data obtained from Twitter. Two variants of the adaptive temporal-causal network model were created, in which one calculated the weights of the connections between the nodes based on follow relations on Twitter, while in the other the connection weights were modulated by the homophily principle. The results indicate that within the considered social network of already active persons homophily does not play an important role in the physical activity behaviour. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Over the years, advertising communication has sought to use creativity to differentiate products and brands; using all possible resources available and with no hesitation in absorbing techniques and methods from different disciplines for the symbolic creation of values and perceptions. With the technological changes and developments in the last 15 years, advertising communication has evolved substantially to adapt to the new media arising in the digital environment. Thus not only the media have transformed but, consubstantially, the means of communicating, objectives and ways have evolved. This scenario has led to the emergence of various, apparently antagonistic, advertising trends. We can see the rise in new vintage trends that recover what is artisan and handmade, while campaigns are developed with increasingly technological applications (bots and new artificial intelligence, for example). These include a great tendency towards scientific and pseudoscientific justification. This not only involves applying neuromarketing to sales environments, but rather recovering old product demonstrations with brand values or understanding the insights applied to a creative concept. Advertising creativity recovered old psychological experiments used in the '60s and '70s, such as the marshmallow experiment, applying them to new creative proposals in special actions. In this way, psychological and sociological advertising experiments find a new way of using the product “demonstration”, or a “scientific” argument for the purchase, creating a brand image or promoting a change in attitude. This text analyses the most representative examples of this recently extended practice in order to analyze their characteristics, conceptualization and audiovisual production, so as to better understand the mechanisms used by the advertising sector to persuade and convince about certain changes in attitude. © 2018, University of La Laguna.

AB  - Healthy lifestyles promotion is the main objective of primary care interventions, starting from the pediatric age, were overweight is nowadays exposing about one third of children to the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Recent years have seen a blast of mHealth apps for health promotion, targeting in particular nutrition and dietary behaviour change. However, reviews show difficulties in the adoption and effective usage of these applications in telemedicine and by the population in general, due to a lack of evidence-based content and strategies provided (e.g., by commercial apps) or lack of sufficient user engagement with the apps. Nutrition apps typically require self-reporting of food intake by the user which is often seen as a burden and a cause of abandonment of the app. However, current wave of research has taken up the challenge of promoting healthy lifestyles with advances in artificial intelligence (AI). This paper focus on AI chatbots as an innovative approach offering more simplicity and facilitating long-Term adherence to health promotion interventions. Conversational assistants provide the advantage of being deployed in smartphones and laptops within a wide variety of applications. We will particularly focus on harnessing the power of intelligent chatbot systems to provide behaviour change interventions in telemedicine for healthy lifestyle promotion. We describe an application scenario for an AI-chatbot delivering support to nutrition education that could help to overcome current limitations of similar mHealth solutions provided for healthy lifestyles and contribute to more effective public health interventions in this application domain. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Clinical recommender systems are increasingly becoming popular for improving modern healthcare systems. Enterprise systems are persuasively used for creating effective nurse care plans to provide nurse training, clinical recommendations and clinical quality control. A novel design of a reliable clinical recommender system based on multiple classifier system (MCS) is implemented. A hybrid machine learning (ML) ensemble based on random subspace method and random forest is presented. The performance accuracy and robustness of proposed enterprise architecture are quantitatively estimated to be above 99% and 97%, respectively (above 95% confidence interval). The study then extends to experimental analysis of the clinical recommender system with respect to the noisy data environment. The ranking of items in nurse care plan is demonstrated using machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to overcome the drawback of the traditional association rule method. The promising experimental results are compared against the sate-of-the-art approaches to highlight the advancement in recommendation technology. The proposed recommender system is experimentally validated using five benchmark clinical data to reinforce the research findings. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Persuasive technology can support persons with chronic conditions to comply with their treatment plan. For persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), staying physically active is crucial to prevent deteriorations of their health status. However, most persons with COPD do not reach and maintain recommended levels of physical activity goals. Although COPD is expected to become the third most common cause of death worldwide, research on how to design persuasive systems for motivating specifically persons with COPD to engage in regular physical activity is still scarce. To bridge this gap, we conducted a study involving persons with COPD (n = 115) to investigate the perceived persuasiveness of 17 strategies (i.e., ratings of their concrete implementation) and individual susceptibility to persuasion (i.e., an underlying disposition to be more receptive to certain persuasive strategies). Based on our analysis, the following strategies were perceived as most persuasive: personalization, reminder, commitment, self-monitoring, rewards, customization, authority, and scarcity. Interestingly, the data revealed differences between perceived persuasiveness and individual susceptibility to persuasion, indicating that both constructs measure distinct aspects of persuasiveness. Our results are relevant to designers and developers of persuasive systems by providing valuable insights about the most promising persuasive strategies and their practical implementation when designing for persons with COPD. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.

AB  - Argumentation mining is an application of natural language processing (NLP) that emerged a few years ago and has recently enjoyed considerable popularity, as demonstrated by a series of international workshops and by a rising number of publications at the major conferences and journals of the field. Its goals are to identify argumentation in text or dialogue; to construct representations of the constellation of claims, supporting and attacking moves (in different levels of detail); and to characterize the patterns of reasoning that appear to license the argumentation. Furthermore, recent work also addresses the difficult tasks of evaluating the persuasiveness and quality of arguments. Some of the linguistic genres that are being studied include legal text, student essays, political discourse and debate, newspaper editorials, scientific writing, and others. The book starts with a discussion of the linguistic perspective, characteristics of argumentative language, and their relationship to certain other notions such as subjectivity. Besides the connection to linguistics, argumentation has for a long time been a topic in Artificial Intelligence, where the focus is on devising adequate representations and reasoning formalisms that capture the properties of argumentative exchange. It is generally very difficult to connect the two realms of reasoning and text analysis, but we are convinced that it should be attempted in the long term, and therefore we also touch upon some fundamentals of reasoning approaches. Then the book turns to its focus, the computational side of mining argumentation in text. We first introduce a number of annotated corpora that have been used in the research. From the NLP perspective, argumentation mining shares subtasks with research fields such as subjectivity and sentiment analysis, semantic relation extraction, and discourse parsing. Therefore, many technical approaches are being borrowed from those (and other) fields. We break argumentation mining into a series of subtasks, starting with the preparatory steps of classifying text as argumentative (or not) and segmenting it into elementary units. Then, central steps are the automatic identification of claims, and finding statements that support or oppose the claim. For certain applications, it is also of interest to compute a full structure of an argumentative constellation of statements. Next, we discuss a few steps that try to 'dig deeper': to infer the underlying reasoning pattern for a textual argument, to reconstruct unstated premises (so-called 'enthymemes'), and to evaluate the quality of the argumentation. We also take a brief look at 'the other side' of mining, i.e., the generation or synthesis of argumentative text. The book finishes with a summary of the argumentation mining tasks, a sketch of potential applications, and a-necessarily subjective-outlook for the field. © 2019 by Morgan & Claypool.

AB  - Describing the human brain in mathematical terms is an important ambition of neuroscience research, yet the challenges remain considerable. It was Alan Turing, writing in 1950, who first sought to demonstrate how time-consuming such an undertaking would be. Through analogy to the computer program, Turing argued that arriving at a complete mathematical description of the mind would take well over a thousand years. In this opinion piece, we argue that — despite seventy years of progress in the field — his arguments remain both prescient and persuasive. © 2017, The Author(s).

AB  - End-to-end argument mining has enabled the development of new automated essay scoring (AES) systems that use argumentative features (e.g., number of claims, number of support relations) in addition to traditional legacy features (e.g., grammar, discourse structure) when scoring persuasive essays. While prior research has proposed different argumentative features as well as empirically demonstrated their utility for AES, these studies have all had important limitations. In this paper we identify a set of desiderata for evaluating the use of argument mining for AES, introduce an end-to-end argument mining system and associated argumentative feature sets, and present the results of several studies that both satisfy the desiderata and demonstrate the value-added of argument mining for scoring persuasive essays.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the value-relevance of corporate sustainability disclosure through integrated reporting. Sustainability disclosure is subject to managers' discretion. Besides, it is often hardly verifiable. In this respect, integrated reporting could provide the means for a verifiable disclosure, otherwise, in the jargon of game theory, it could be considered as a cheap talk. This paper investigates which of these hypotheses is most likely to occur in reality. In order to do this, a simple theoretical framework is introduced, where sustainability of corporate performances is modelled as a tail-risk for shareholders. Costless signaling games (cheap talk) and persuasion games are reviewed within this context, in order to derive competing theories of sustainability disclosure's value relevance through integrated reporting. These alternative theories are tested empirically consistent with the theoretical framework presented, in order to identify key-parameters. In this respect, a systematic textual analysis (artificial intelligence) of integrated reports was employed as to build a synthetic measure of sustainability disclosure. The application of this methodology on a sample of European listed companies showed that sustainability disclosure through integrated reporting has no effect on market-valuations, confirming the null hypothesis of integrated reporting resulting in a cheap talk's babbling equilibrium. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - The rapid growing trend of mobile devices continues to soar causing massive increase in cyber security threats. Most pervasive threats include ransom-ware, banking malware, premium SMS fraud. The solitary hackers use tailored techniques to avoid detection by the traditional antivirus. The emerging need is to detect these threats by any flow-based network solution. Therefore, we propose and evaluate a network based model which uses ensemble Machine Learning (ML) methods in order to identify the mobile threats, by analyzing the network flows of the malware communication. The ensemble ML methods not only protect over-fitting of the model but also cope with the issues related to the changing behavior of the attackers. The focus of this study is on android based mobile malwares due to its popularity among users. We have used ensemble methods to combine output of 5 supervised ML algorithms such as RF, PART, JRIP, J.48 and Ridor. Based on the evaluation results, the proposed model was found efficient at detecting known and unknown threats with the accuracy of 98.2%. © 2017 Infonomics Society.

AB  - Healthcare costs are increasing dramatically due to disproportional consumption of healthcare resources by chronic patients. Automated forms of health coaching can contribute to improved patient self-management while reducing costs due to increased scalability and availability of the use of human health coaches. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) seem to be good candidates to function as automated coaches, as they introduce a social component to human-computer interactions which makes them particularly suitable to influence a user’s attitude or behavior. To date, there is limited knowledge on the impact of appearance-related characteristics of an ECA as a virtual coach among a chronically ill elderly population. The primary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of three appearance cues on user acceptance: (i) similarity; (ii) familiarity; and (iii) realism. Findings demonstrate that patients (a) preferred the realistic-looking ECA over the more stylized one; (b) showed no preference for the familiar over the unfamiliar ECAs (but did evaluate the unfamiliar ECAs as more positive than the familiar one); and (c) evaluated an ECA as virtual coach for self-management support as useful. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - An argument is seen as reason in favour of a claim. It is made of three parts: a set of premises representing the reason, a conclusion representing the supported claim, and a connection showing how the premises lead to the conclusion. Arguments are frequently exchanged by human agents in natural language (spoken or written) in discussion, debate, negotiation, persuasion, etc. They may be very different in that their three components may have various forms. In this paper, we propose a language for representing such arguments. We show that it is general enough to capture the various forms of arguments encountered in natural language, and that it is possible to represent attack and support relations between arguments as formulas of the same language. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This study aimed to explore supportive capabilities of VAs with the potential benefit in mind that users of self-guided eHealth interventions could be better supported. Spontaneous empathy and the explicitly expressed intention of non-responsive VAs to deliver user support is likely capable to engage and motivate users. Responsive VAs have even larger potential. However, they are more costly to realize and have a higher risk of failure. Effective user frustration detection and mitigation by Responsive VAs has been empirically demonstrated, but so far within artificial contexts. Altogether it makes sense to further explore the option to add VAs as adjuncts to self-guided eHealth interventions a potential remedy to low adherence. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Urban legends are a genre of modern folklore, consisting of stories about rare and exceptional events, just plausible enough to be believed, which tend to propagate inexorably across communities. In our view, while urban legends represent a form of "sticky" deceptive text, they are marked by a tension between the credible and incredible. They should be credible like a news article and incredible like a fairy tale to go viral. In particular we will focus on the idea that urban legends should mimic the details of news (who, where, when) to be credible, while they should be emotional and readable like a fairy tale to be catchy and memorable. Using NLP tools we will provide a quantitative analysis of these prototypical characteristics. We also lay out some machine learning experiments showing that it is possible to recognize an urban legend using just these simple features. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many applications of virtual agents, including those in healthcare and education, require engaging users in dozens or hundreds of interactions over long periods of time. In this effort, we are developing conversational agents to engage young adults in longitudinal lifestyle health behavior change interventions. Hip-hop and rap are one of the most popular genres of music among our stakeholders, and we are exploring rap as an engagement mechanism and communication channel in our agent-based interventions. We describe a method for integrating rap into a counseling dialog by a conversational agent, including the acoustic manipulation of synthetic speech and accompanying character dance animation. We demonstrate in a within-subjects study that the participants who like rap music preferred the rapping character significantly more than an equivalent agent that does not rap in its dialog, based on both self-report and behavioral measures. Participants also found the rapping agent significantly more engaging than the non-rapping one. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - This paper describes the design of a smartphone based fall detection system and characterizes the preliminary efficacy of the proposed system in activities of daily living (ADLs). Using the embedded sensors available in a smartphone (i.e., accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer), kinematic analysis of movement can be performed in real-time, allowing for continuous monitoring of fall status. Fall sensing thresholds are defined based on angular rate of change (TH1), maximum acceleration (TH2), and maximum attitude change (TH3). TH1 is measured from the resultant pitch and roll angular velocity vector and defined as 3.1 rad/s (∼180°/s). TH2 is measured from the resultant acceleration vector and defined as 1.6 g. TH3 is measured from the resultant vector of the pitch and roll angles, and defined at 0.59 rad (39°). A proof-of-concept study was performed on five ADL tasks: 1) comfortable walking, 2) stand-to-seated posture, 3) seated-to-standing posture, 4) pivoting at the waist to pick up an object, and 5) stand-to-seated-to-laying transition. No trials violated the defined thresholds for fall detection, signifying no false positives. These results are important for the definition of machine learning algorithms, currently under development, to minimize false positive and false negative fall detection events. © 2015 Institute of Control, Robotics and Systems - ICROS.

AB  - Recent work on argument persuasiveness has focused on determining how persuasive an argument is. Oftentimes, however, it is equally important to understand why an argument is unpersuasive, as it is difficult for an author to make her argument more persuasive unless she first knows what errors made it unpersuasive. Motivated by this practical concern, we (1) annotate a corpus of debate comments with not only their persuasiveness scores but also the errors they contain, (2) propose an approach to persuasiveness scoring and error identification that outperformscompeting baselines, and (3) show that the persuasiveness scores computed by our approach can indeed be explained by the errors it identifies.

AB  - The term "Gamification" is an emerging paradigm that aims to employ game mechanics and game thinking to change behavior. Gamification offers several effective ways to motivate users into action such as challenges, levels and rewards. However, an open research problem is discovering the set of gamification features that consistently result in a higher probability of success for a given task, game or application. The objective of this paper is to bridge this knowledge gap by quantifying the gamification features that are consistently found in successful applications. Knowledge gained from this work will inform designers about the gamification features that lead to higher chances of an application's success, and the gamification features that do not significantly impact the success of an application. The case study presented in this work leverages demographic heterogeneity and scale of applications existing within mobile platforms to evaluate the impact of gamification features on the success or failure of those applications. The successful game design features identified have the potential to be embedded into interactive gamification platforms across various fields such as healthcare, education, military and marketing, in order to maintain or enhance user engagement. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Research on the use of mobile to promote mindfulness states is still relatively nascent, especially when exploring how such states can be cultivated in everyday life, outside of meditation-based approaches. In this study we investigate the design of a mobile app that seeks to cultivate mindfulness states situated in everyday life. Using reminders to prompt self-reflection and breathing exercises to prompt body awareness, we sought to address the overarching question – how can we design towards mindfulness situated in everyday living and how might it change what we mean by mindfulness? Our findings suggest that mobile-based approaches can promote curiosity and decentering through self-reflection, and that the valence and likelihood of experiencing certain mental events may influence how self-reflection is experienced, which in turn influences curiosity and decentering factors of mindfulness states. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In persuasion dialogues, the ability of the persuader to model the persuadee allows the persuader to make better choices of move. The epistemic approach to probabilistic argumentation is a promising way of modelling the persuadee’s belief in arguments, and proposals have been made for update methods that specify how these beliefs can be updated at each step of the dialogue. However, there is a need to better understand these proposals, and moreover, to gain insights into the space of possible update functions. So in this paper, we present a general framework for update functions in which we consider existing and novel update functions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - In this study, we explore the impact of feedback, feedforward, and personality on computer-mediated behavior change. We studied the impacts of the effects using subjects who entered information relevant to their diet and exercise into a database through an online tool. We divided the subjects into four experimental groups: those who received only feedback, those who received only feedforward, those who received both feedback and feedforward, and those who received neither feedback nor feedforward. We found that both feedforward and feedback impacted behavior change but that the effect was much greater for individuals who ranked low in conscientiousness than for individuals who ranked high in conscientiousness. In fact, the magnitude of the effect of feedforward and feedback was nearly the same as the magnitude of the effect of conscientiousness. © 2017 by the Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Utility stakeholders often view autonomic feedback systems as valuable tools for moderating consumption of household resources (e.g. electricity). However, to be successful, such technology must be not only informative but also persuasive. This paper presents the water user classification (WUC) function of a decision support system (DSS) for residential water consumers. This function has been designed to harness personal value systems and wider social norms in order to promote water conservation. It uses data on home appliance efficiency, routine water usage and environmental values to attribute DSS users with a water user identity. Where the attributed identity is at odds with a self-defined 'green' identity, users may be prompted to reevaluate their everyday practices. The function also offers 'smart' personalized water saving advice. In these ways, it aims to encourage consumers to adopt sustainable water saving behaviors. This paper describes the design of the WUC function and its contribution to the DSS. It additionally highlights the crucial role of behavior change theory in the delivery of successful technology-based interventions. © 2016 Chinese Automation and Computing Society.

AB  - In this paper we theoretically reflect upon persuasive technology usage under the light of technology appropriation. The intended usage of technology often fails, meaning that the designers’ intended use is not always translated into user behavior. This is also true for persuasive technology, since technology will always be used within a context involving users’ own intentions that may not always be anticipated by designers. This clashes with Fogg’s framing of captology, which explicitly focuses on endogenous intent, i.e., a persuasive intent that is designed into a technology. With this paper we open up an initial theoretical discourse around these two concepts, highlighting how the design of persuasive technologies can be informed by existing knowledge around technology appropriation. This is done by reflecting upon three identified ‘action points’: (1) learning from appropriation, (2) designing for appropriation, and (3) designing for personal differences and ambiguity of interaction. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Determining the minimal amount of resources needed to ensure minimal number of bottlenecks in the patient flow not only promotes patient satisfaction but also provides financial benefits to hospitals. The increase of data gathering by healthcare facilities in the last years have brought new opportunities to apply machine learning techniques to tackle this problem. This work makes use of data gathered from the Oulu University Hospital in Finland between 2011 and 2014 to study the effectiveness of machine learning techniques to predict resources usage. This work investigates the problem of resource frequency prediction and compares the performance of Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest. The application of data clustering as a preprocessing step is also explored as a way to improve the prediction accuracy of resources whose behavior change over time. The results indicate that 1) highly frequented resources can be predicted with higher accuracy than the lowly frequented resources, 2) the Random Forest have similar performance to the Nearest Neighbours although Random Forest performs better, 3) clustering improves the performance of the Nearest Neighbours but not of Random Forest, and 4) if averages are used to determine the resource frequency then cluster averages yields higher accuracy than all data averages. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Pokémon GO is a location-based game that caused hype around the globe in 2016. Its primary objective is to “Catch’em All”, meaning to catch all available Pokémon. These are virtual creatures distributed in the real world and the player has to walk around and catch them. Various game-design elements such as fighting against other Pokémon or hatching eggs by covering a predefined distance promote physical activity. In this paper, we present the results of an online survey (N = 124) that investigated whether Pokémon GO persuaded players to walk more and in particular which game-design elements had the highest influence on walking behavior. Results show that Pokémon GO persuades people to leave the home and increase exercise. Game-design elements such as catching as many different Pokémon and completing the Pokédex are more persuasive than fighting and competition challenges. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Using computer technologies, the physical world in which we live and the virtual worlds generated by computers or popular cultures are coming closer together. Virtual agents are often designed that refer to humans in the physical world; at the same time, physical world products or services draw stories and emotions using characters. Computers can adjust virtual representations in the physical world based on the informa-tion they represent which is possessed by computers, and this adjustment leads to perceived personification. In this paper, we discuss the perception of personification and the possibil-ity of application for persuasion. We developed a prototype application and then conducted surveys and a task-based user study. The results suggest the possibility of persuasion from personified agents superimposed close to an object. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - A Do Something Different (DSD) behaviour change programme consists of a series of digitally delivered behavioural prompts, or “Dos”, for targeted behaviour change designed to aid people to achieve personal goals or to break bad habits. “Dos” may address for example behaviour connected with exercise, smoking, diet, sleep or diabetes self-management, or personal development objectives such as leadership. DSD’s current database contains thousands of such “Dos”, developed by behaviour change experts. We have developed an ontology to organise the large database of behavioural prompts in order to help DSD with its knowledge management. We began by developing an ontology of function, bottom-up; then we expanded this into a multi-perspective ontology covering WHO, WHAT, HOW, WHEN, WHERE and WHY perspectives. The expected benefits from our ontology are: 1. response data from users can be aggregated by ontology category to get insights into users’ behaviour, 2. the ontology enables the implementation of smarter algorithms for selecting which “Dos” to suggest to which users, and 3. the ontology assists in the process of generating new “Dos”, either by domain experts or by crowd-sourcing. Finally we follow an ontology-theoretic approach to argue that our ontology should be re-usable across other behaviour change applications, but maybe not across other application types. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Researchers have long converged that the evolution of a Social Networking Service (SNS) platform is driven by the interplay between users' preferences (reflected in user-item consumption behavior) and the social network structure (reflected in user-user interaction behavior), with both kinds of users' behaviors change from time to time. However, traditional approaches either modeled these two kinds of behaviors in an isolated way or relied on a static assumption of a SNS. Thus, it is still unclear how do the roles of users' historical preferences and the dynamic social network structure affect the evolution of SNSs. Furthermore, can jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs benefit both behavior prediction tasks? In this paper, we leverage the underlying social theories (i.e., social influence and the homophily effect) to investigate the interplay and evolution of SNSs. We propose a probabilistic approach to fuse these social theories for jointly modeling users' temporal behaviors in SNSs. Thus our proposed model has both the explanatory ability and predictive power. Experimental results on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Real-world data streams may change their behaviors along time, what is referred to as concept drift. By detecting those changes, researchers obtain relevant information about the phenomena that produced such streams (e.g. temperatures in a region, bacteria population, disease occurrence, etc.). Many concept drift detection algorithms consider supervised or semi-supervised approaches which tend to be unfeasible when data is collected at high frequencies, due to the difficulties involved in labeling. Complementarily, current studies usually assume data as statistically independent and identically distributed, disregarding any temporal relationship among observations and, consequently, risking the quality of data modeling. In order to tackle both aspects, we employ dynamical system modeling to represent the temporal relationships among data observations and how they modify along time in attempt to detect concept drift. This approach considers Taken's immersion theorem to unfold consecutive windows of data observations into the phase space in attempt to represent and compare time dependencies. From this perspective, we proposed four new concept drift detection algorithms based on the unsupervised machine learning paradigm. The first algorithm builds dendrograms of consecutive phase spaces (every phase space represents the time relationships for the observations contained in a particular data window) and compare them out by using the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, providing enough guarantees to detect concept drifts. The second algorithm employs the Cross Recurrence Plot and the Recurrence Quantification Analysis to detect relevant changes in consecutive phase spaces and warn about relevant data modifications. We also preprocess data windows by considering the Empirical Mode Decomposition method and Mutual Information in attempt to take only the deterministic stream behavior into account. All algorithms were implemented as plugins for the Massive Online Analysis (MOA) software and then compared to well-known algorithms from literature. Results confirm the proposed algorithms were capable of detecting most of the behavior changes, creating few false alarms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The issue of practices in co-located human-human persuasive encounters remained unattended in the PT community. This study uses the notion of persuasive practices to understand the course of events in face-to-face home security advisory sessions – it specifies and illustrates such practices and discusses their impact on the persuasiveness of the encounter. Furthermore, it presents potential of IT to support such persuasive practices thus opening new research possibilities of PT research. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Pokémon Go can be considered a successful persuasive game to promote physical activity. This study provides an in-depth analysis of Pokémon Go players’ characteristics that relate to adoption and continued play of the game. Based on online studies at two different points in time (at the initial release and three months later) we analyzed differences in personality traits between players and non-players, as well as between players who continued playing the game and those who stopped playing. The results show that people who played the game score lower in “Conscientiousness” and higher in “Player Motivation” than non-players. Furthermore, people who continued playing the game three months later have a lower score in “Neuroticism” than those who stopped playing. Insights into player characteristics from our empirical analysis of Pokémon Go contribute to answering the key research question regarding to which personality characteristics the persuasive game experience should be personalized. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Cyber physical systems are critical to the infrastructure of a country. They are becoming more vulnerable to cyber attacks due to their use of off the shelf servers and industrial network protocols. Availability on World Wide Web for monitoring and reporting, has further aggravated their risk of being attacked. Once an attacker breaches the network security, he can affect the operations of the system which may even lead to a catastrophe. Mathematical and formal models try to detect the departure of the system from its expected behaviour but are difficult to build, and are sensitive to noise. Furthermore they take a lot of time to detect the attack. We here propose a behaviour based machine learning intrusion detection approach that quickly detects attacks at the physical process layer. We validate our result on a complete replicate of the physical and control components of a real modern water treatment facility. Our approach is fast, scalable, robust to noise, and exhibits a low false positive (FP) rate with high precision and recall. The model can be easily updated to match the changing behaviour of the system and environment. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This work is targeted towards the development of a Robotic Elderly Assistant (REA) system that provides assistance in the form of recommendations to support single-living elderly people in their domestic environment. To avoid potential face threats the REA should be as polite as possible whilst keeping a certain persuasiveness to promote its recommendations. This paper investigates different verbalizations of the REA’s recommendations regarding their perceived politeness as well as their persuasiveness. We present the results of a laboratory study with younger adults and a user study with the inhabitants of a retirement home. Results suggest that the different politeness strategies reflected different levels of politeness in both studies, while their perceived persuasiveness needs further investigation in the domain of elderly care. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Argument mining systems for student essays need to be able to reliably identify argument components independently of particular essay topics. Thus in addition to features that model argumentation through topic-independent linguistic indicators such as discourse markers, features that can abstract over lexical signals of particular essay topics might also be helpful to improve performance. Prior argument mining studies have focused on persuasive essays and proposed a variety of largely lexicalized features. Our current study examines the utility of such features, proposes new features to abstract over the domain topics of essays, and conducts evaluations using both 10-fold cross validation as well as cross-topic validation. Experimental results show that our proposed features significantly improve argument mining performance in both types of cross-fold evaluation settings. Feature ablation studies further shed light on relative feature utility. Copyright © 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All right reserved.

AB  - Ambient intelligence technologies are making our daily life increasingly virtual, and the boundary between the real world and the virtual world is gradually disappearing. Computer games are often played on the Internet, which allows people to enjoy games with others, even when they are not at the same location. This paper analyzes the Trading Card Game (TCG), which has two versions. One version is played with paper-based cards, whereas the other is played on a computer. The computer-based TCG supports remote play and has a number of enhancements, such as providing special fictional effects on virtual cards. The two different versions are useful to analyze the influence of virtuality in making future social interaction more playful. First, we investigate potential pitfalls to introduce virtuality in TCG through the scenario-based analysis, which adopts a player’s personality to exploit potential difficulties. For investigating further insights on the influence of virtuality in TCG, we analyze some experiments with Augmented Trading Card Game, where a real opponent player is replaced with a fictional player. Our findings from the analyses show that the feeling of realness is essential to make incorporated virtuality successful. Recently some games’ concepts can be adopted in order to augment our real world. It is essential to investigate the influence of virtuality introduced with the games. The future social interaction will incorporate virtuality based on a variety of game-like features to make the interaction more playful. Therefore, the insights described in this paper will be useful to help the design of future playful social interaction. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

AB  - After having produced many criteria to improve accessibility, ease of use, emotions linked to interactions, persuasive design, cultural values attached to systems, socio-organizational contexts, the domain of HCI must conduct a reflection on the structuring of these criteria. The aim of this paper is to advance research in the field of user experience criteria by understanding how UX professionals organize their cognitions around the criteria set. For this, we conducted a study of its classification with 17 experts. The set of 58 cards was presented by explaining that each card represents a criterion. The experts were asked to do an open card sort, to name the groups of cards and, upon completion, to explain the logic they had based their sorting on. On the basis of several statistical analyzes, the results show a categorization into 8 main classes: (1) Utility (task-system suitability, achieving the goal, efficacy) and Pragmatism (ergonomic criteria, efficiency); (2) Hedonism, Pleasure, Emotions; (3) Persuasion, Incitement, Pervasive design; (4) Emotional & Cognitive Stimulation for self-development; (5) Marketing strategy/Customer Relationship Management; (6) Security/Reliability-User’s protection; (7) Organizational factors; and (8) Social, moral and/or cultural factors. This article proposes a multifactorial approach to UX which is based on these 8 dimensions that combine and coordinate with one another. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Nowadays, argumentation is a salient keyword in artificial intelligence. The use of argumentation techniques is particularly convenient for thematics such that multiagent systems, where it allows to describe dialog protocols (using persuasion, negotiation,...) or on-line discussion analysis, it also allows to handle queries where a single agent has to reason with conflicting information (inference in the presence of inconsistency, inconsistency measure). This very rich framework gives numerous reasoning tools, thanks to several acceptability semantics and inference policies. On the other hand, the progress of SAT solvers in the recent years, and more generally the progress on Constraint Programming paradigms, lead to some powerful approaches that permit to tackle theoretically hard problems. The needs of efficient applications to solve the usual reasoning tasks in argumentation, together with the capabilities of modern Constraint Programming solvers, lead us to study the encoding of usual acceptability semantics into logical settings. We propose diverse use of Constraint Programming techniques to develop a software library dedicated to argumentative reasoning. We present a library which offers the advantages to be generic and easily adaptable. We finally describe an experimental study of our approach for a set of semantics and inference tasks, and we describe the behaviour of our solver during the First International Competition on Computational Models of Argumentation. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Poor sleep quality can cause diverse deficiencies in mental and physical health. Several information and communication technologies (ICT) systems have been developed to improve sleep quality, most of which monitor patterns in sleep epochs to determine the quality of sleep. We propose a personal ICT ecosystem (PICTE) to address the same problem through a different approach. Our work considers the integration of technology (hardware and software) to obtain data related to sleep hygiene habits. The PICTE processes these data through an inference model based on a machine learning algorithm. Besides, a persuasive system sends advice/reward messages to users, to persuade them to change their habits to improve sleep quality. © 2016 EAI.

AB  - The design principles of persuasive systems and the corresponding software features have been shown to have a positive effect on individuals’ behavior and systems use. This study continues along the same line by analyzing the effects of these design principles on users’ perceived competence and intention to continue to use an online commitment device. A structural equation modelling approach is used to identify the factors that affect the intention to continue to use the system. Data (N = 173) collected from the system’s users is tested against the proposed research model. The results show that 37% of users’ continuance intention is explained by the implemented persuasive software feature categories (computer–human dialogue support, primary task support, perceived credibility, and social support) and perceived competence. Of these categories, primary task support has the strongest effect on perceived competence and continuance intention. The study concludes with a discussion and recommendations for future research. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - In this paper we question the ability of the existant ranking semantics for argumentation to capture persuasion settings, emphasizing in particular the phenomena of protocatalepsis (the fact that it is often efficient to anticipate the counter-arguments of the audience), and of fading (the fact that long lines of argumentation become ineffective). It turns out that some widely accepted principles of ranking-based semantics are incompatible with a faithful treatment of these phenomena. We thus propose a parametrized semantics based on propagation of values, which allows to control the scope of arguments to be considered for evaluation. We investigate its properties (identifying in particular threshold values guaranteeing that some properties hold), and report experimental results showing that the family of rankings that may be returned have a high coherence rate. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - In this paper we present the development of the pedometer app Move My Day which implements goal setting as its main persuasive design principle. Manual goal input as well as two strategies to support users in setting realistic goals, namely reference routes and personal goal recommendation, were implemented. The proposed algorithm for adaptive personal goal recommendation is designed in a way that it recommends short-term goals considering motivational aspects and gradually raises goals in the long term to meet physical activity recommendations. In a 12 week field study, we investigated the potentials of the two support strategies. Results indicate that about half of the users appreciate goal setting support and that especially personal goal recommendation seems to have potential to support users in setting effective physical activity goals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The realization of the smart grid depends critically on the successful engagement of consumers in adapting their energy consumption behavior to the intermittent generation of renewable energy. The engaged consumers participate in demand response programs in which they provide a shift of electricity consumption based on incentives provided. However, understanding the concept of load shifting and the decision when to shift consumption is quite complex for most consumers and it may interfere with daily practices leading to inconveniences. Therefore, there is a strong need for efficient decision-support systems to help consumers to shift or not to shift electricity consumption. This paper presents a conceptual framework aimed at system designers and developers of electricity load shifting applications. The framework is validated by implementation of a prototype that provides planning and decision support for consumers. The prototype provides insight into possible load shifting capability by providing feedback on the CO2 emission intensity of energy production, thus encouraging consumers to change behavior and consume energy in a more sustainable way. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Automated agents should be able to persuade people in the same way people persuade each other - via dialogs. Today, automated persuasion modeling and research use unnatural assumptions regarding persuasive interaction, which creates doubt regarding their applicability for real-world deployment with people. In this work we present a novel methodology for persuading people through argumentative dialogs. Our methodology combines theoretical argumentation modeling, machine learning and Markovian optimization techniques that together result in an innovative agent named SPA. Two extensive field experiments, with more than 100 human subjects, show that SPA is able to persuade people significantly more often than a baseline agent and no worse than people are able to persuade each other. © 2016 The Authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper discusses the emergence of cooperative and coordinated behaviors between joint and concurrent learning agents using deep Q-learning. Multi-agent systems (MAS) arise in a variety of domains. The collective effort is one of the main building blocks of many fundamental systems that exist in the world, and thus, sequential decision making under uncertainty for collaborative work is one of the important and challenging issues for intelligent cooperative multiple agents. However, the decisions for cooperation are highly sophisticated and complicated because agents may have a certain shared goal or individual goals to achieve and their behavior is inevitably influenced by each other. Therefore, we attempt to explore whether agents using deep Q-networks (DQN) can learn cooperative behavior. We use doubles pong game as an example and we investigate how they learn to divide their works through iterated game executions. In our approach, agents jointly learn to divide their area of responsibility and each agent uses its own DQN to modify its behavior. We also investigate how learned behavior changes according to environmental characteristics including reward schemes and learning techniques. Our experiments indicate that effective cooperative behaviors with balanced division of workload emerge. These results help us to better understand how agents behave and interact with each other in complex environments and how they coherently choose their individual actions such that the resulting joint actions are optimal. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Question Answering Systems (QASs) have emerged as a good alternative for information seekers to retrieve precise information over the Internet. A good amount of research has been done to improve the performance of QASs across several languages, including European and Asian languages. However, Arabic, a morphologically rich Semitic language spoken by over 422 million people, has not seen similar development in the field of question answering. This article reviews the developments taking place in Arabic QASs as well as the challenges faced by researchers in developing Arabic QASs. After conducting an extensive literature survey of a number of English and Arabic QASs, this article classifies them according to several criteria. The most commonly used architecture for the development of an Arabic QAS, known as pipeline architecture, has been presented. In order to encourage and support the new researchers and scholars in conducting research in Arabic QASs, a list of techniques, tools, and computational linguistic resources, required to implement the components of the presented pipelined architecture, are described in this article in a simple and persuasive manner. Finally, the gap analysis between the research in Arabic and English QASs has been performed and accordingly, some future directions for research in Arabic QASs have been proposed. © 1989-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Unwholesome lifestyles can reduce lifespan by several years or even decades. Therefore, raising awareness and promoting healthier behaviors prove essential to revert this dramatic panorama. Virtual coaching systems are at the forefront of digital solutions to educate people and procure a more effective health self-management. Despite their increasing popularity, virtual coaching systems are still regarded as entertainment applications with an arguable efficacy for changing behaviors, since messages can be perceived to be boring, unpersonalized and can become repetitive over time. In fact, messages tend to be quite general, repetitive and rarely tailored to the specific needs, preferences and conditions of each user. In the light of these limitations, this work aims at help building a new generation of methods for automatically generating user-tailored motivational messages. While the creation of messages is addressed in a previous work, in this paper the authors rather present a method to automatically extract the semantics of motivational messages and to create the ontological representation of these messages. The method uses first natural language processing to perform a linguistic analysis of the message. The extracted information is then mapped to the concepts of the motivational messages ontology. The proposed method could boost the quantity and diversity of messages by automatically mining and parsing existing messages from the internet or other digitised sources, which can be later tailored according to the specific needs and particularities of each user. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - Individuals with chronic stress can improve their overall wellness by making lifestyle changes. We describe the design and evaluation of a computer-animated conversational agent that is used in conjunction with Integrative Medical Group Visits (IMGV) to help individuals with chronic pain and depression manage their stress. The agent coaches patients in between group visit sessions, reviewing how to manage stress using non-pharmaceutical techniques (e.g., mindfulness, meditation, yoga self-massage). We conducted a longitudinal clinical trial with 154 participants in which patients in the intervention group interacted with the conversational agent at home on a touch screen tablet to reinforce what they learned in group medical visits. Results from the trial indicate that the conversational agent, in conjunction with medical group visits, leads to significantly more positive stress management behaviors in patients compared to outcomes that arise in usual care, after 9 and 21 weeks. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

Following a personality assessment, subjects imagined themselves in a scenario and evaluated the effectiveness of messages constructed using Cialdini’s principles of persuasion. Our results suggest that messages exploiting the principle of authority are the most effective across a range of personality types. In addition, personality had a statistically significant impact on the persuasiveness of messages, with “conscientious” subjects more willing to be persuaded than others. Finally, we found that positively framed messages were more preferred than negatively ones. We also found some interaction effects between personality traits and Cialdini’s principles and framing on persuasiveness. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Research has suggested regular breaks in sedentary office work are important for health, wellbeing and long-term productivity. Although many computerized break reminders exist, few are based on user needs and requirements as determined by formative research. This paper reports empirical findings from a diary-probed interview study with 20 office workers on their perceived barriers and facilitators to taking regular micro-breaks at work. This work makes two contributions to the Persuasive Technology (PT) community: a diagnosis of the full range of determinants and levers for changing office work break behaviours; a demonstration of applying the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW), an intervention development framework originating from Health Psychology, to elicit theory-based design recommendations for a potential PT. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Background and Purpose - This study evaluated the use of an artificial intelligence platform on mobile devices in measuring and increasing medication adherence in stroke patients on anticoagulation therapy. The introduction of direct oral anticoagulants, while reducing the need for monitoring, have also placed pressure on patients to self-manage. Suboptimal adherence goes undetected as routine laboratory tests are not reliable indicators of adherence, placing patients at increased risk of stroke and bleeding. Methods - A randomized, parallel-group, 12-week study was conducted in adults (n=28) with recently diagnosed ischemic stroke receiving any anticoagulation. Patients were randomized to daily monitoring by the artificial intelligence platform (intervention) or to no daily monitoring (control). The artificial intelligence application visually identified the patient, the medication, and the confirmed ingestion. Adherence was measured by pill counts and plasma sampling in both groups. Results - For all patients (n=28), mean (SD) age was 57 years (13.2 years) and 53.6% were women. Mean (SD) cumulative adherence based on the artificial intelligence platform was 90.5% (7.5%). Plasma drug concentration levels indicated that adherence was 100% (15 of 15) and 50% (6 of 12) in the intervention and control groups, respectively. Conclusions - Patients, some with little experience using a smartphone, successfully used the technology and demonstrated a 50% improvement in adherence based on plasma drug concentration levels. For patients receiving direct oral anticoagulants, absolute improvement increased to 67%. Real-time monitoring has the potential to increase adherence and change behavior, particularly in patients on direct oral anticoagulant therapy. © 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - Swarm intelligence algorithms are wildly used in different areas. The bare bones particle swarm optimization (BBPSO) is one of them. In the BBPSO, the next position of a particle is chosen from the Gaussian distribution. However, all particles learning from the only global best particle may cause the premature convergence and rapid diversity-losing. Thus, a BBPSO with dynamic local search (DLS-BBPSO) is proposed to solve these problems. Also, because the blind setting of local group may cause the time complexity an unpredictable increase, a dynamic strategy is used in the process of local group creation to avoid this situation. Moreover, to confirm the searching ability of the proposed algorithm, a set of well-known benchmark functions are used in the experiments. Both unimodal and multimodal functions are considered to enhance the persuasion of the test. Meanwhile, the BBPSO and several other evolutionary algorithms are used as the control group. At last, the results of the experiment confirm the searching ability of the proposed algorithm in the test functions. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Social networks differ in their structure and objectives, hence, the effectiveness of persuasion principles or patterns may vary from one type of network to another. This study aims to identify the persuasive principles that make a typical Q&A network successful. Using Stack Overflow as a case study, we applied the PSD model to evaluate the persuasive principles of the network. Our results show that all but four principles of the PSD model were implemented in Stack Overflow. This study can help social network developers build persuasive Q&A social networks and improve on existing social platforms. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Despite being an important component of problem-solving ability, relatively little is known about the linguistic features of creativity and the related constructs of elaboration, humor, and persuasion. In order to better understand the linguistic features of these constructs, two analyses were performed to examine relationships between linguistic features and human judgments of humor, persuasion, creativity, and elaboration. First, linguistic indices derived from automatic text analysis tools were used to predict human categorizations of utterances for humor and persuasion in a corpus of natural dialogue produced during a creative problem-solving and divergent thinking task. Four linguistic indices related to the use of function words, word age-of-acquisition, and spoken word frequency distinguished humor and persuasion with approximately 50% accuracy. These linguistic features, along with incidence scores for humorous and persuasive categories based on human ratings per dialogue were then used to predict human ratings of creativity and elaboration from the same corpus. Less variation in use of function words significantly predicted both creativity and elaboration scores, and lower spoken word frequency and higher incidences of humorous utterances significantly predicted creativity scores. These results demonstrate the potential for linguistic features to explain creativity and elaboration and highlight connections between humor, persuasion, and creativity.

AB  - In this paper the potentials of identifying unusual user behaviors and changes of behavior from smart home energy meters are investigated. We compare the performance of the classical change detection Page-Hinkley test (PHT) with a new application of a self-adaptive stream clustering algorithm to detect novelties related to the time of use of appliances at home. With the use of annotated data, the true positive rate of the clustering-based method outperformed the PHT by at least 20%. Moreover the method was able to identify behavior changes related to time shifts and replacement of appliances. The motivation for this study is based on the need for identifying and guiding behavior changes that can reduce energy consumption, and use this knowledge in the development of systems that can raise just-in-time warnings to save energy (e.g. avoid stand-by modes), and guide sustainable behavior changes. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In acronym Captology - Computers as Persuasive Technology, a persuasive component (lat. persuasibilibus - enticing) refers to the persuasive stimulation by intelligent technologies. Latter being transitive and interactive as intelligent systems, they have imposed, by their persuasivity, a ‘cult of information’, after which information has become a type of goods that as a utilitarian resource must be exploited quickly and efficiently. Such a widely accepted fact resulted as hype, presenting a perspective that the approach to a large amount of information and faster ‘digestion’ of their content will enable users to quickly get desired knowledge. Recent investigations about persuasion processes have shown its dependence on intelligent technology factors (design, interactive computer products, web, desktop and others). Such technologies are also used to influence people's attitudes, beliefs, learning, and behaviour. Development strategies for global computer production and sales head in that direction and confirm latter statement with the promoted 3-P model: persuasive, permissive and pervasive components. Cognitive level of human integrated development is increasingly overshadowed by the contribution of artificial intelligence through its products, i.e. ‘smart’ creations, and by the array of shortcomings and problems that the same interactive technology brings. This paper presents a parallel between captological component of intelligent and interactive technologies on one side and illustrates examples of captological influences proved by confirmed trials within cognitive science through computer simulations of human thinking on the other side. Many studies have shown that the success of persuasion depends on the factors which have been exposed by cognitive cybernetics. Next to it, people’s behavior system is transforming through the very development of society. Therefore, the influence of latter can be either positive or negative, while its extremes are already escalating in direction of a new trans-singularity and post humanism theories based on the principles of extropy. © 2017 ASTES Publishers.

AB  - Assumptions of the goal framing theory are applied to the specific context of a nightlife environment. Focusing on public urination as specific and often occurring antisocial behaviour in nightlife environments, this research explored how choice behaviour of potential public urinators can be influenced in a positive way. One boundary condition was to intervene in choice behaviour without negatively affecting the widely appreciated attractive and stimulating character of nightlife environments. Five experimental forms of nudging and priming are conducted to facilitate alternative social behaviour and to further stimulate potential public urinators to perform social behaviour. This was done by activating positive emotions, presenting visible and accessible alternatives and influencing subjective norms. Facilitating social behaviour reduced public urination by 41%, while additional interventions reduced public urination up to 67%. The results contribute to an extension of goal framing theory to specific contexts like nightlife environments. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - This article reviews data-centric approaches for statistical modeling of driver behavior. Modeling driver behavior is challenging due to its stochastic nature and the high degree of inter- and intradriver variability. One way to deal with the highly variable nature of driving behavior is to employ a data-centric approach that models driver behavior using large amounts of driving data collected from numerous drivers in a variety of traffic conditions. To obtain large amounts of realistic driving data, several projects have collected real-world driving data. Statistical machine-learning techniques, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and deep learning, have been successfully applied to model driver behavior using large amounts of driving data. We have also collected on-road data recording hundreds of drivers over more than 15 years. We have applied statistical signal processing and machine-learning techniques to this data to model various aspects of driver behavior, e.g., driver pedal-operation, car-following, and lane-change behaviors for predicting driver behavior and detecting risky driver behavior and driver frustration. By reviewing related studies and providing concrete examples of our own research, this article is intended to illustrate the usefulness of such data-centric approaches for statistical driver-behavior modeling. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Digital images can easily be tampered because of the popularity and power editing software. In order to create a persuasive forged image, the image is usually exposed to several geometric transformations, such as rescaling and rotating. Since the manipulations require a resampling step, uncovering traces of resampling became an important approach for detecting image forgeries. In this paper, we propose a new technique to reveal image resampling artifacts. The technique employs specific features of the linear dependencies of neighboring image samples for discriminating resampled images from original images. A machine learning method is utilized for classification. Experimental results in a large dataset show that the proposed technique is good in detecting resampled images, even when the manipulated images were slightly transformed. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.

AB  - Argument-based persuasion dialogues provide an effective mechanism for agents to communicate their beliefs, and their reasons for those beliefs, in order to convince another agent of some topic argument. In such dialogues, the persuader has strategic considerations, and must decide which of its known arguments should be asserted, and the order in which they should be asserted. Recent works consider mechanisms for determining an optimal strategy for persuading the responder. However, computing such strategies is expensive, swiftly becoming impractical as the number of arguments increases. In response, we present a strategy that uses heuristic information of the domain arguments and can be computed with high numbers of arguments. Our results show that not only is the heuristic strategy fast to compute, it also performs significantly better than a random strategy. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper describes a canine posture detection system composed of wearable sensors and instrumented devices that detect the postures sit, stand, and eat. The system consists of a customized harness outfitted with wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) and a base station for processing IMU data to classify canine postures. Research in operant conditioning, the science of behavior change, indicates that successful animal training requires consistent and accurate feedback on behavior. Properly designed computer systems excel at timeliness and accuracy, which are two characteristics most amateur trainers struggle with and professionals strive for. Therefore, in addition to the system being ergonomically designed to ensure the dog׳s comfort and well-being, it is engineered to provide posture detection with timing and accuracy on par with a professional trainer. We contend that providing a system with these characteristics will one day aid dogs in learning from humans by overcoming poor or ineffective timing during training. We present the initial steps in the development and validation of a computer-assisted training system designed to work outside of laboratory environments. The main contributions of this work are (a) to explore the trade-off between low-latency responses to changes in time-series IMU data representative of posture changes while maintaining accuracy and timing similar to a professional trainer, and (b) to provide a model for future ACI technologies by documenting the user-centered approach we followed to create a computer-assisted training system that met the criteria identified in (a). Accordingly, in addition to describing our system, we present the results of three experiments to characterize the performance of the system at capturing sit postures of dogs and providing timely reinforcement. These trade-offs are illustrated through the comparison of two algorithms. The first is Random Forest classification and the second is an algorithm which uses a Variance-based Threshold for classification of postures.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: With the rise of autonomous e-mental health applications, virtual agents can play a major role in improving trustworthiness, therapy outcome and adherence. In these applications, it is important that patients adhere in the sense that they perform the tasks, but also that they adhere to the specific recommendations on how to do them well. One important construct in improving adherence is psychoeducation, information on the why and how of therapeutic interventions. In an e-mental health context, this can be delivered in two different ways: verbally by a (virtual) embodied conversational agent or just via text on the screen. The aim of this research is to study which presentation mode is preferable for improving adherence. METHODS: This study takes the approach of evaluating a specific part of a therapy, namely psychoeducation. This was done in a non-clinical sample, to first test the general constructs of the human-computer interaction. We performed an experimental study on the effect of presentation mode of psychoeducation on adherence. In this study, we took into account the moderating effects of attitude towards the virtual agent and recollection of the information. Within the paradigm of expressive writing, we asked participants (n= 46) to pick one of their worst memories to describe in a digital diary after receiving verbal or textual psychoeducation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: We found that both the attitude towards the virtual agent and how well the psychoeducation was recollected were positively related to adherence in the form of task execution. Moreover, after controlling for the attitude to the agent and recollection, presentation of psychoeducation via text resulted in higher adherence than verbal presentation by the virtual agent did. © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - The aim of this research is to conduct a pilot study of a prototype that provides feedback using theory-based motivating messages developed by older adults, in a context of every day activities that include both physical and social activities. The prototype mobile application integrated the messages, a motivational model, and a personalization module that selects motivational messages based on preferences, motivational profile and the situation. The four participating older adults used the application for planning and following up social and physical activities. They found the messages entertaining and appreciated the dialogues with the application. They used the dialogues primarily to reinforce their satisfaction regarding conducted activities and did not necessarily tell the truth about conduced activities in the interaction with the application. The results are preliminary, but give valuable implications for further development of the personalisation module towards more purposeful use of ambient information, and aspects to explore in future user studies. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - A study is presented that tests the relation between the (perceived) personality of an online interactive system and the personality of its user. We expected a system with a dominant interaction style to be more persuasive than a submissive one. Moreover, we expected people with dominant personalities to be persuaded more by a dominant system, while people with submissive personalities would be persuaded more by a submissive one. These expectations were tested in a study where participants were provided with automated persuasive messages that had either a dominant or a submissive style. Results support our hypotheses and show that the similarity-attraction paradigm can be extended to persuasive technologies. However, findings also show that the dominant system is perceived as less likable. Although it is hard to predict whether these effects occur in real-world settings, the current work could help creating technologies that adapt their persuasive messages to their users. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - We propose a novel approach in a dataset of argumentation relations. This task is intended to analyze the presence of a support relation between two sentences. To be able to identify relations between two sentences or arguments, one is obliged to understand the nuance brought by both sentences. Our models are modification of siamese network architectures, in which we replace the feature extractor into Long Short Term Memory and implement cosine distance as the energy function. Our models take a pair of sentences as their input and try to identify whether there is a support relation between those two sentences or not.The primary motivation of this research is to prove that a high degree of similarity between two sentences correlates to sentences supporting each other. This work will focus more on the modification of siamese network and the implementation of attention mechanism. Due to the difference in dataset setting, we cannot arbitrarily compare our results with the prior research results. Therefore, this work will not highlight the comparison between deep learning and traditional machine learning algorithm per se, but it will be more of an exploratory research. Our models are able to outperform the baseline score of accuracy with a margin of 17.33% (67.33%). By surpassing the baseline performance, we believe that our work can be a stepping stone for deep learning implementation in argumentation mining field. © 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Personalized and contextual interventions are promising techniques for mobile persuasive technologies in mobile health. In this paper, we propose the "fingerprints" technique to analyze the users' daily behavior patterns to find the meaningful moments to better support mobile persuasive technologies, especially mobile health interventions. We assume that for many persons, their behaviors have patterns and can be detected through the sensor data from smartphones. We develop a three-step interactive machine learning workflow to describe the concept and approach of the "fingerprints" technique. By this we aim to implement a practical and light-weight mobile intervention system without burdening the users with manual logging. In our feasibility study, we show results that provide first insights into the design of the "fingerprints" technique.

AB  - We investigate the effect of relational dialogue on creating rapport and exerting social influence in human-robot conversation, by comparing interactions with and without a relational component, and with different agent types. Human participants interact with two agents - a Nao robot and a virtual human - in four dialogue scenarios: one involving building familiarity, and three involving sharing information and persuasion in item-ranking tasks. Results show that both agents influence human decision-making; people prefer interacting with the robot, feel higher rapport with the robot, and believe the robot has more influence; and that objective influence of the agent on the person is increased by building familiarity, but is not significantly different between the agents.

AB  - Language use is a type of behavior not yet addressed by the academic persuasive technology community. Yet, many existing applications seek to change users’ word choices or writing style. This paper catalogues 32 such applications in common usage or reported in the popular media. We use Schwartz’s Theory of Basic Human Values to understand what motivates each attempt to persuade; we use the Persuasive Systems Design (PSD) model to understand contexts and techniques of persuasion. While motivations span the full range of human values, most applications serve values of Achievement, Conformity, or Universalism. Many are autogenous in intent, using reduction, suggestion, and self-monitoring strategies to support behavior change. However, the corpus also includes many endogenous applications that seek to change others’ attitudes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Many online platforms support social functions that enable their members to communicate, befriend, and join groups with one another. These social engagements are known to shape individuals’ future behavior. However, most work has focused solely on how peers influence behavior and little is known what additional role online groups play in changing behavior. We investigate the capacity for group membership to lead users to change their behavior in three settings: (1) selecting physical activities, (2) responding to help requests, and (3) remaining active on the platform. To do this, we analyze nearly half a million users over five years from a popular fitness-focused social media platform whose unique affordances allow us to precisely control for the effects of social ties, user demographics, and communication. We find that after joining a group, users readily adopt the exercising behavior seen in the group, regardless of whether the group was exercise and non-exercise themed, and this change is not explained by the influence of pre-existing social ties. Further, we find that the group setting equalizes the social status of individuals such that lower status users still receive responses to requests. Finally, we find, surprisingly, that the number of groups one joins is negatively associated with user retention, when controlling for other behavioral and social factors. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a new design strategy for integrating fictionality into the real world named Alternative Reality, which makes it possible to connect the daily urban world with the virtual world from a temporal aspect to influence humans to adopt better lifestyles. The worlds also can be seamlessly integrated because the virtual world consists of real landscapes, objects and persons. This means that it may be possible to enhance the real world by showing fictional events among real events: people experience the enhanced hybrid world as in the real world rather than in a fictional world such as a movie. To demonstrate the design strategy of Alternative Reality, we have developed two case studies. The first case study investigates whether a user can sense the improbable behavior of a moving object as realistic, where the user can interact with the object. The second case study investigates whether a user can experience fictional occurrences in the virtual world as they are experienced in the real world. In both case studies, a user wears a head-mounted display to increase the immersion in the hybrid world created by Alternative Reality, in which the virtual world is created by capturing the real world with a 360-degree camera. The insights of the experiments with the case studies show that Alternative Reality effectively augments the real world without losing touch with reality. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.

AB  - Research has shown that Competition is one of the most powerful persuasive strategies to intrinsically motivate users in a social context towards performing a target behavior. However, in persuasive technology research, studies showing the predictors of the “persuasiveness of Competition” as a motivational strategy are scarce. Consequently, based on a sample size of 213 Canadians, we tested a model using three socially influential strategies (Social Learning, Social Comparison and Reward) as predictors of Competition. Our model accounts for 42% of the variation in Competition and reveals that Reward is the strongest predictor of Competition, followed by Social Comparison, but Social Learning is not a predictor. Moreover, it reveals that Social Comparison mediates the influence of Reward on Social Learning and Competition. Our findings provide designers of persuasive applications with insight into the possibility of implementing Reward, Social Comparison and Competition as effective co-strategies for stimulating user engagement in gamified applications. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - There are many sleep tracking technologies in the consumer market nowadays. These technologies offer rich functions ranging from sleep pattern tracking to smart alarm clock. However, previous study indicates that users find these technologies of little use in facilitating sleep quality improvement, as simply making a user aware of how poor his/her sleep is provides no actionable information on how to improve it. Armed with such understanding, we proposed an architecture for designing intelligent sleep analysis systems and developed a prototype called SleepExplorer to help users automatically analyse and visualize the interrelationship of his/her sleep quality and the context (i.e., psychological states, physiological states, lifestyle, and environment). Such contextual information is crucial in helping users understand what the potential reasons for their sleep problems might be. We conducted a 2-week field study with 10 diverse participants, learning that SleepExplorer help users make sense of their sleeptracking data and reflect on their lifestyle, and that the system has potentially positive impact on sleep behaviour change. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - We examined evidence on whether mobile health (mHealth) tools, including interactive voice response calls, short message service, or text messaging, and smartphones, can improve lifestyle behaviors and management related to cardiovascular diseases throughout the world. We conducted a state-of-the-art review and literature synthesis of peer-reviewed and gray literature published since 2004. The review prioritized randomized trials and studies focused on cardiovascular diseases and risk factors, but included other reports when they represented the best available evidence. The search emphasized reports on the potential benefits of mHealth interventions implemented in low- and middle-income countries. Interactive voice response and short message service interventions can improve cardiovascular preventive care in developed countries by addressing risk factors including weight, smoking, and physical activity. Interactive voice response and short message service-based interventions for cardiovascular disease management also have shown benefits with respect to hypertension management, hospital readmissions, and diabetic glycemic control. Multimodal interventions including Web-based communication with clinicians and mHealth-enabled clinical monitoring with feedback also have shown benefits. The evidence regarding the potential benefits of interventions using smartphones and social media is still developing. Studies of mHealth interventions have been conducted in >30 low- and middle-income countries, and evidence to date suggests that programs are feasible and may improve medication adherence and disease outcomes. Emerging evidence suggests that mHealth interventions may improve cardiovascular-related lifestyle behaviors and disease management. Next-generation mHealth programs developed worldwide should be based on evidence-based behavioral theories and incorporate advances in artificial intelligence for adapting systems automatically to patients' unique and changing needs. © 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.

AB  - The present study explores persuasive and interventional strategies for designing and evaluating low-threshold browser games that adequately aim for affording prejudice-reducing social impact in everyday life scenarios. Our investigation was guided by the premise that a covert persuasion approach is suited for also reaching out to otherwise adverse attitude holders. Building on a framework for embedding change-related messages into games by their design, and in combination with rhetorical techniques and subversive strategies from queer-theoretical philosophy and social psychology, we modified an existing impactful game about Coming Out so as to obfuscate its change-related content, and make it more approachable for a not-queer audience. The evaluation of the modified prototype suggests the efficacy of the employed strategies for facilitating and elevating emotional engagement based on group membership effects, which is linked to a greater potential for attitude change and prejudice reduction. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017 Published by Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Persuasion is an activity that involves one party (the persuader) trying to induce another party (the persuadee) to believe or do something. For this, it can be advantageous for the persuader to have a model of the persuadee. Recently, some proposals in the field of computational models of argument have been made for probabilistic models of what the persuadee knows about, or believes. However, these developments have not systematically harnessed established notions in decision theory for maximizing the outcome of a dialogue. To address this, we present a general framework for representing persuasion dialogues as a decision tree, and for using decision rules for selecting moves. Furthermore, we provide some empirical results showing how some well-known decision rules perform, and make observations about their general behaviour in the context of dialogues where there is uncertainty about the accuracy of the user model.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the cognitive role of analogical abduction in skill acquisition. Abductive inference makes it possible to find missing links that explain a given knack in achieving a skillful task. We introduced meta level abduction to realize rule abduction which is mandatory in finding intermediate missing links to be added in knack explanation. Analogical abduction can be achieved by adding analogical inference rules to causality rules within meta level abduction. We have applied our analogical abduction method to the problem of explaining the difficult cello playing techniques of spiccato and rapid cross strings of the bow movement. Our method has constructed persuasive analogical explanations about how to play them. We have used a model of forced vibration mechanics as the analogy base world for spiccato, and the specification of the skeletal structure of the hand as the basis for the cross string bowing technique. We also have applied analogical abduction to show the effectiveness of a metaphorical expression of “eating pancake on the sly” to achieve forte-piano dynamics, and successfully identified an analogical explanation of how it works. Through these examples, we show the effectiveness of analogical abduction in skill acquisition. Furthermore we discuss the importance of meta level representation as a basis for providing rich human cognitive paradigm such as causality, analogy and metaphor. Finally we propose a cognitive architecture which gives a possible structure for realizing accommodation on our analogical abduction schema. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Purpose – Credit risk assessment has gained importance in recent years due to global financial crisis and credit crunch. Financial institutions therefore seek the support of credit rating agencies to predict the ability of creditors to meet financial persuasions. The purpose of this paper is to construct neural network (NN) and fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM) classifiers to discriminate good creditors from bad ones and identify a best classifier for credit risk assessment. Design/methodology/approach – This study uses artificial neural network, the most popular AI technique used in the field of financial applications for classification and prediction and the new machine learning classification algorithm, FSVM to differentiate good creditors from bad. As membership value on data points influence the classification problem, this paper presents the new FSVM model. The instances membership is computed using fuzzy c-means by evolving a new membership. The FSVM model is also tested on different kernels and compared and the classifier with highest classification accuracy for a kernel is identified. Findings – The paper identifies a standard AI model by comparing the performances of the NN model and FSVM model for a credit risk data set. This work proves that that FSVM model performs better than back propagation-neural network. Practical implications – The proposed model can be used by financial institutions to accurately assess the credit risk pattern of customers and make better decisions. Originality/value – This paper has developed a new membership for data points and has proposed a new FCM-based FSVM model for more accurate predictions. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Computational models of argument are being developed to capture aspects of how persuasion is undertaken. Recent proposals suggest that in a persuasion dialogue between some agents, it is valuable for each agent to model how arguments are believed by the other agents. Beliefs in arguments can be captured by a joint belief distribution over the arguments and updated as the dialogue progresses. This information can be used by the agent to make more intelligent choices of move in the dialogue. Whilst these proposals indicate the value of modelling the beliefs of other agents, there is a question of the computational viability of using a belief distribution over all the arguments. We address this problem in this paper by presenting how probabilistic independence can be leveraged to split this joint distribution into an equivalent set of distributions of smaller size. Experiments show that updating the belief on the split distribution is more efficient than performing updates on the joint distribution. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Recent approaches on tackling the problem of sustainable transportation involve persuasive systems and applications. These systems focus on changing citizens’ behavior towards adopting transportation habits that rely more on the use of public transportation, bicycles and walking and less on private cars. A main drawback of existing applications is the limited use or lack of personalization aspects that consider differences in users’ susceptibility to persuasive strategies. In this paper, we explore two user traits that can be used for personalizing the persuasive strategies applied to end users: personality and mobility type. More specifically, we present the results of a study where we examined the perceived persuadability of eight persuasive strategies on users of five personality types and three mobility types. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - Enormous amounts of knowledge sharing occur every day in community question answering (CQA) sites, some of which (for example, Stack Overflow or Ask Ubuntu) have become popular with software developers and users. In spite of these systems' overall success, problems are emerging in some of them - increased failure and churn rates. To investigate this trend, researchers conducted a case study of Stack Overflow. First, they evaluated the community perception that the emerging problems are heavily related to the growing amount of low-quality content created by undesired groups of users (help vampires, noobs, and reputation collectors). Reproducible data analyses of content and community evolution supported these findings. Suggestions to deal with the emerging problems include providing users with responder-oriented adaptive support that involves a whole community in QA. Such approaches represent an eminent attitude change regarding QA support, with the aim to preserve CQA ecosystems' long-term sustainability. © 1984-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Threats make part of the set of rhetorical arguments, which are used in negotiation dialogues when a proponent agent tries to persuade his opponent to accept a proposal more readily. When more than one threat is generated, the proponent must evaluate each and select the most adequate. One way of evaluation is calculating the strength of threats, since a strong threat may quickly convince an opponent. The contribution of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, we present a mechanism of generation of threats and, on the other hand, we propose a model for calculating the strength of threats, which is based on the goal processing inside the mental state of the opponent. We propose two ways for calculating the strength of threats depending on the kind of negotiation the agent is participating. The first proposal is to be used when the agent negotiates only with one opponent, and the second when the agent negotiates with more than one opponent. © 2016 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - For persuasion dialogues between a software system and user, a user should be able to present arguments. Unfortunately, this would involve natural language processing which is not viable for this task in the short-term. A compromise is to allow the system to present potential counterarguments to the user, and the user expresses his/her degree of belief in each of them. In this paper, we present a protocol for persuasion that supports this type of move, and show how the system can use the epistemic approach to probabilistic argumentation to model the user, and thereby optimize the choice of moves. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Non-adherence is considered a problem that seriously undermines the outcome of behavior change therapies, in particular of self-help therapies delivered without human interference. This paper presents the design rationale behind a computer system in the domain of adherence enhancing strategies in automated e-coaching. A variety of persuasive strategies is introduced and implemented in a mobile e-coaching system in the domain of insomnia therapy. The system integrates two types of interface elements, i.e. dedicated tools and natural language conversation, to simplify therapy related activities and to include social strategies to improve motivation. We focus on the crucial role of communication and adaptation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The goal of persuasive games is to change behavior and attitudes in a desirable manner, e.g., to promote physical activity. Research has shown that personalized persuasive approaches are more successful than one-size-fits-all approaches. As a means for personalization, sex has been investigated with results showing that women are overall more persuadable than men. We argue that considering only a dichotomous sex-type categorization may not be able to fully capture the differences in the persuasiveness of persuasion strategies. To that end we apply a dimensional approach of capturing gender identity – femininity and masculinity. We investigate the relationship between masculinity, femininity, sex and the persuasiveness of ten persuasion strategies in an online study (n = 592). Results show that femininity is significantly associated with seven of the ten strategies, while sex does only show differences for two strategies, suggesting gender identity could be a reliable variable for personalizing persuasive games. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Utility companies generally have an extensive customer base, yet their knowledge about individual households is small. This adversely affects both the development of innovative, household specific services and the utilities' key performance indicators such as customer loyalty and profitability. With the goal to overcome this knowledge deficit, persuasive systems in the form of customer self-service applications and efficiency coaching portals are becoming the getaway of data exchange between utility and user. While improved customer interaction and the collection of customer data within respective information systems is an important step towards a service-oriented company, the immediate value generated from the collected data is still limited, mostly due to the small fraction of customers actually using such systems. We show how to utilize the knowledge gained from the sparse number of active web users in order to provide low-cost and large-scale insights to potentially all residential utility customers. We do so using machine-learning-based Green IT artifacts that allow for improving decision-making, effectiveness of energy audits, and conservation campaigns, thus ultimately increasing the customer value and adoption of related services. Moreover, we show that data from the publi-cally available geographic information systems can considerably improve the decision quality.

AB  - Smart home environments offer an unprecedented opportunity to unobtrusively monitor human behavior. Sensor data collected from smart homes can be labeled using activity recognition to help determine whether relationships exist between behavior in the home and health changes. To detect and analyze behavior changes that accompany health events, we introduce the behavior change detection (BCD) approach. BCD detects activity timing and duration changes between windows of time, determines the significance of the detected changes, and analyzes the nature of the changes. We demonstrate our approach using two case studies for older adults living in smart homes who experienced major health events, including cancer treatment and insomnia. Our algorithm detects behavior changes consistent with the medical literature for these cases. The results suggest the changes can be automatically detected using BCD. The proposed smart home, activity recognition algorithms, and change detection approach are useful data mining techniques for understanding the behavioral effects of major health conditions. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - Healthy lifestyles promotion is the main objective of primary care interventions, starting from the pediatric age, were overweight is nowadays exposing about one third of children to the risk of developing chronic diseases, such as diabetes. Recent years have seen a blast of mHealth apps for health promotion, targeting in particular nutrition and dietary behaviour change. However, reviews show difficulties in the adoption and effective usage of these applications in telemedicine and by the population in general, due to a lack of evidence-based content and strategies provided (e.g., by commercial apps) or lack of sufficient user engagement with the apps. Nutrition apps typically require self-reporting of food intake by the user which is often seen as a burden and a cause of abandonment of the app. However, current wave of research has taken up the challenge of promoting healthy lifestyles with advances in artificial intelligence (AI). This paper focus on AI chatbots as an innovative approach offering more simplicity and facilitating long-term adherence to health promotion interventions. Conversational assistants provide the advantage of being deployed in smartphones and laptops within a wide variety of applications. We will particularly focus on harnessing the power of intelligent chatbot systems to provide behaviour change interventions in telemedicine for healthy lifestyle promotion. We describe an application scenario for an AI-chatbot delivering support to nutrition education that could help to overcome current limitations of similar mHealth solutions provided for healthy lifestyles and contribute to more effective public health interventions in this application domain. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Security is an important concern worldwide. Stackelberg Security Games have been used successfully in a variety of security applications, to optimally schedule limited defense resources by modeling the interaction between attackers and defenders. Prior research has suggested that it is possible to classify adversary behavior into distinct groups of adversaries based on the ways humans explore their decision alternatives. However, despite the widespread use of Stackelberg Security Games, there has been little research on how adversaries adapt to defense strategies over time (i.e., dynamics of behavior). In this paper, we advance this work by showing how adversaries' behavior changes as they learn the defenders' behavior over time. Furthermore, we show how behavioral game theory models can be modified to capture learning dynamics using a Bayesian Updating modeling approach. These models perform similarly to a cognitive model known as Instance-Based-Learning to predict learning patterns. Copyright © TRECVID 2016.All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to solve the problem that the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm has a low success rate when applied to the optimization of multi-dimensional and multi-extreme value functions, the authors would introduce the extended memory factor to the PSO algorithm. Furthermore, the paper aims to improve the convergence rate and precision of basic artificial fish swarm algorithm (FSA), a novel FSA optimized by PSO algorithm with extended memory (PSOEM-FSA) is proposed. Design/methodology/approach – In PSOEM-FSA, the extended memory for PSO is introduced to store each particle’ historical information comprising of recent places, personal best positions and global best positions, and a parameter called extended memory effective factor is employed to describe the importance of extended memory. Then, stability region of its deterministic version in a dynamic environment is analyzed by means of the classic discrete control theory. Furthermore, the extended memory factor is applied to five kinds of behavior pattern for FSA, including swarming, following, remembering, communicating and searching. Findings – The paper proposes a new intelligent algorithm. On the one hand, this algorithm makes the fish swimming have the characteristics of the speed of inertia; on the other hand, it expands behavior patterns for the fish to choose in the search process and achieves higher accuracy and convergence rate than PSO-FSA, owning to extended memory beneficial to direction and purpose during search. Simulation results verify that these improvements can reduce the blindness of fish search process, improve optimization performance of the algorithm. Research limitations/implications – Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack persuasion. In the future study, the authors will conduct more experiments to understand the behavior of PSOEM-FSA. In addition, there are mainly two aspects that the performance of this algorithm could be further improved. Practical implications – The proposed algorithm can be used to many practical engineering problems such as tracking problems. Social implications – The authors hope that the PSOEM-FSA can increase a branch of FSA algorithm, and enrich the content of the intelligent algorithms to some extent. Originality/value – The novel optimized FSA algorithm proposed in this paper improves the convergence speed and searching precision of the ordinary FSA to some degree. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - The persuasiveness of an argument depends on the values promoted and demoted by the position defended. This idea, inspired by Perelman’s work on argumentation, has become a prominent theme in artificial intelligence research on argumentation since the work by Hafner and Berman on teleological reasoning in the law, and was further developed by Bench-Capon in his value-based argumentation frameworks. One theme in the study of value-guided argumentation is the comparison of values. Formal models involving value comparison typically use either qualitative or quantitative primitives. In this paper, techniques connecting qualitative and quantitative primitives recently developed for evidential argumentation are applied to value-guided argumentation. By developing the theoretical understanding of intelligent systems guided by embedded values, the paper is a step towards ethical systems design, much needed in these days of ever more pervasive AI techniques. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - A key acceptability criterion for artificial agents will be the possible moral implications of their actions. In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to influence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because of their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are rare and tend to focus on the output of the required action; instead, this work focuses on the acceptability of persuasive acts themselves. Building systems able to persuade while being ethically acceptable requires that they be capable of intervening flexibly and of taking decisions about which specific persuasive strategy to use. We show how, exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment of moral dilemmas, we obtain results that will lead to more ethically appropriate systems. Experiments we have conducted address the type of persuader, the strategies adopted and the circumstances. Dimensions surfaced that can characterize the interpersonal differences concerning moral acceptability of machine performed persuasion, usable for strategy adaptation. We also show that the prevailing preconceived negative attitude toward persuasion by a machine is not predictive of actual moral acceptability judgement when subjects are confronted with specific cases. © Copyright 2016, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - The iGenda framework is a cognitive assistant that helps care-receivers and caregivers in the management of their agendas. One of the problems detected in systems of this kind is the lack of user engagement. This engagement can be improved through the application of persuasion techniques in order to convince users to act in a specific way. According to this, this paper presents a new architecture that will allow the system to select and recommend activities that potentially best suits to the users’ interests based on argumentation techniques. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - In multiparty meetings, participants need to predict the end of the speaker's utterance and who will start speaking next, as well as consider a strategy for good timing to speak next. Gaze behavior plays an important role in smooth turn-changing. This article proposes a prediction model that features three processing steps to predict (I) whether turn-changing or turn-keeping will occur, (II) who will be the next speaker in turnchanging, and (III) the timing of the start of the next speaker's utterance. For the feature values of the model, we focused on gaze transition patterns and the timing structure of eye contact between a speaker and a listener near the end of the speaker's utterance. Gaze transition patterns provide information about the order in which gaze behavior changes. The timing structure of eye contact is defined as who looks at whom and who looks away first, the speaker or listener, when eye contact between the speaker and a listener occurs. We collected corpus data of multiparty meetings, using the data to demonstrate relationships between gaze transition patterns and timing structure and situations (I), (II), and (III). The results of our analyses indicate that the gaze transition pattern of the speaker and listener and the timing structure of eye contact have a strong association with turn-changing, the next speaker in turn-changing, and the start time of the next utterance. On the basis of the results, we constructed prediction models using the gaze transition patterns and timing structure. The gaze transition patterns were found to be useful in predicting turn-changing, the next speaker in turn-changing, and the start time of the next utterance. Contrary to expectations, we did not find that the timing structure is useful for predicting the next speaker and the start time. This study opens up new possibilities for predicting the next speaker and the timing of the next utterance using gaze transition patterns in multiparty meetings. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Cell reagents used in biomedical analysis often change behavior of the cells that they are attached to, inhibiting their native signaling. On the other hand, label-free cell analysis techniques have long been viewed as challenging either due to insufficient accuracy by limited features, or because of low throughput as a sacrifice of improved precision. We present a recently developed artificial-intelligence augmented microscope, which builds upon high-throughput time stretch quantitative phase imaging (TS-QPI) and deep learning to perform label-free cell classification with record high-accuracy. Our system captures quantitative optical phase and intensity images simultaneously by frequency multiplexing, extracts multiple biophysical features of the individual cells from these images fused, and feeds these features into a supervised machine learning model for classification. The enhanced performance of our system compared to other label-free assays is demonstrated by classification of white blood T-cells versus colon cancer cells and lipid accumulating algal strains for biofuel production, which is as much as five-fold reduction in inaccuracy. This system obtains the accuracy required in practical applications such as personalized drug development, while the cells remain intact and the throughput is not sacrificed. Here, we introduce a data acquisition scheme based on quadrature phase demodulation that enables interruptionless storage of TS-QPI cell images. Our proof of principle demonstration is capable of saving 40 TB of cell images in about four hours, i.e. pictures of every single cell in 10 mL of a sample. Copyright © 2017 SPIE.

AB  - Integration of renewable energy resources into power networks is the trend in power distribution system. It is to reduce burden of centralized power plant and global emissions, increase usage of renewable energy, and diverse energy supply market. However, solar photovoltaic which is a type of renewable energy resource, is found to generate peak capacity for a short duration only. Next, its output is intermittent and randomness. In addition, it changes behavior of power distribution system from unidirectional to bidirectional. As a result, it causes different types of power quality events to the power networks. Therefore, these power quality events are urged to be mitigated to further explore the potential of solar photovoltaic system. This paper aims to investigate negative impacts of photovoltaic (PV) grid-tied system to the power networks, and study on performance of artificial intelligence (AI) and conventional methods in mitigating power quality event. According to the surveys, power system monitoring, inverter, dynamic voltage regulator, static synchronous compensator, unified power quality conditioner and energy storage system are able to compensate power quality events which are caused by PV grid-tied system. From the studies, AI methods usually outperform conventional methods in terms of response time and controllability. They also show talent in multi-mode operation, which is to switch to different operation modes according to the environment. However, they require memory to achieve abovementioned tasks. It is believed that unsupervised learning AI is the future trend as it can adapt to the environment without the need of collecting large amount of data before the AI is implemented. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Allrightsreserved.

AB  - The focus placed on maximizing user engagement in online advertising negatively affects the user experience because of advertising clutter and increasing intrusiveness. An intelligent decision support system providing balance between user experience and profits from online advertising based on the fuzzy multi-objective optimization model is presented in this paper. The generalized mathematical model uses uncertain parameters for content descriptors that are difficult to be precisely defined and measured, such as the level of intrusiveness and the change in performance over time. The search for final decision solutions and the verification of the proposed model are based on experimental results from both perceptual studies, which are evaluating visibility and intrusiveness of marketing content as well as online campaigns providing interaction data for estimation of effectiveness. Surprisingly, the online response to the most noticeable advertisements with highly perceived visibility and intrusiveness was relatively low. During the field study performed in order to compute the model parameters, the best results were achieved for advertising content with moderate visual influence on web users. Simulations with the proposed model revealed that a growing level of persuasion can increase results only to a certain extent. Above a saturation point, a strategy based on extensive visual effects, such as high-frequency flashing, resulted in a very high increase of intrusiveness and a slightly better performance in terms of acquired interactions. Proposed balanced content design with the use of intelligent decision support system creates directions towards sustainable advertising and a friendlier online environment. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - There is a lack of energy consumption awareness in working spaces. People in their workplaces do not receive energy consumption feedback nor do they pay a monthly invoice to electricity providers. In order to enhance workers’ energy awareness, we have transformed everyday shared electrical appliances which are placed in common spaces (e.g. beamer projectors, coffee-makers, printers, screens, portable fans, kettles, and so on) into persuasive eco-aware everyday things. The proposed approach lets these appliances report their usage patterns to a Cloud-server where the data are transformed into time-series and then processed to obtain the appliances’ next-week usage forecast. Autoregressive integrated moving average model has been selected as the potentially most accurate method for processing such usage predictions when compared with the performance exhibited by three different configurations of Artificial neural networks. Our major contribution is the application of soft computing techniques to the field of sustainable persuasive technologies. Thus, consumption predictions are used to trigger timely persuasive interactions to help device users to operate the appliances as efficiently, energy-wise, as possible. Qualitative and quantitative results were gathered in a between-three-groups study related with the use of shared electrical coffee-makers at workplace. The goal of these studies was to assess the effectiveness of the proposed eco-aware design in a workplace environment in terms of energy saving and the degree of affiliation between people and the smart appliances to create a green-team relationship. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Cognitive assistance may be valuable in applications that reduce costs and improve quality in healthcare systems. Use cases and scenarios include persuasion, i.e., the design, development and evaluation of interactive technologies aimed at changing users' attitudes or behaviours through persuasion, but not through coercion or deception. We motivate persuasion for healthcare systems and propose solutions from an artificial intelligence (AI) perspective for conceptual design and system implementation. The goal is to develop an IoT (Internet-Of-Things) toolbox towards Al-based persuasive technologies for healthcare systems.

AB  - Discussion among individuals about a given issue often induces polarization and bipolarization effects, i.e. individuals radicalize their initial opinion towards either the same or opposite directions. Experimental psychologists have put forward Persuasive Arguments Theory (PAT) as a clue for explaining polarization. PAT claims that adding novel and persuasive arguments pro or contra the debated issue is the major cause for polarization. Recent developments in abstract argumentation provide the tools for capturing these intuitions on a formal basis. Here Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (BAF) are employed as a tool for encoding the information of agents in a debate relative to a given issue a. A probabilistic extension of BAF allows to encode the likelihood of the opinions pro or contra a before and after information exchange. It is shown, by a straightforward example, how these measures provide the basis to capture the intuitions of PAT.

AB  - Socially-oriented persuasive strategies (competition, social comparison, and cooperation) which leverage the power of social influence have been widely employed in Persuasive Technologies (PTs) designs. However, there have been mixed findings regarding their effectiveness. There is still a dearth of knowledge on the mechanism through which these strategies could motivate or demotivate behaviors. To advance research in this area, we conduct a large-scale qualitative and quantitative study of 1768 participants to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of these strategies and their comparative effectiveness at motivating healthy behaviors. Our results reveal important strengths and weaknesses of individual strategies that could facilitate or hinder their effectiveness such as their tendency to simplify a behavior and make it fun, challenge people and make them accountable and their tendency to jeopardize individual’s privacy and relationships, creates unnecessary tension, and reduce self-confidence, respectively. The results, also show that there are significant differences between the strategies with respect to their persuasiveness overall with the social comparison being the most persuasive of the strategies. We contribute to the PT community by revealing the strengths and weaknesses of individual strategies that should be taken into account by designers when employing each of the strategies. Furthermore, we offer design guidelines for operationalizing the strategies to amplify their strengths and overcome their weaknesses. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

AB  - The rise of smart mobile devices presents increasing opportunities for health monitoring outside the clinic. Through the use of sensors and wearables, innovative Connected Health applications can be developed. In particular, Digital Therapeutics (DT), a type of technology-enabled intervention, can be made possible through continuous data capture, aiding users through gaining feedback on their lifestyle choices and engagement with programs of recovery, and supplementing conventional treatments for chronic disease management such as diabetes, epilepsy, and mental health. Unfortunately, patient-facing professionals capable of articulating appropriate sensor-enabled solutions, generally lack the full range of skills to develop such systems. A connected health application may involve mobile development, data services, visualisation, machine learning, and sensor signal processing, needing multidisciplinary teams, including professional software engineers. The cost of maintaining a software team across the research and development stages may prove prohibitive for many, hindering innovation. This paper focuses on gathering requirements for data collection in mHealth studies, and reports the initial findings after a round of interviews with researchers in areas such as psychology, physiotherapy, neurology, and health promotion education. Those requirements are framed within an existing End User Development (EUD) tool to create mobile apps for the Android platform, the open source project MIT App Inventor. The survey results highlight not only the development work needed for App Inventor to be used as a data collection tool in DT, but also a number of potential security and privacy issues, and the implementation of a layered feedback loop with a social aspect at the heart of it. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - A selection of web-based eHealth interventions have evolved from innovative prototypes to evidence-based and clinically applied solutions for mental diseases such as depression and anxiety. Open-access, self-guided types of those solutions hold the promise of reaching and treating a large population against reasonable costs. However, a considerable factor that currently hinders the effectiveness of these self-guided web-based interventions is the high level of attrition. The absence of a human caregiver apparently has a negative effect on user adherence. Although clear evidence on the rationale for non-adherence is currently missing, recent studies indicate that user support could an important causal factor. In this paper we describe the protocol of an exploratory user study which aims to identify the persuasive features of virtual coaches in terms of user support. Virtual coaches are anthropomorphized instances of software, designed to engage and motivate users. We will measure user experience, engagement, motivation and perceived persuasiveness during usage of the 'Living to the Full' intervention. We will compare a condition with and without empathic virtual coach condition to explore its supportive capabilities. © 2016, CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - We devise a scenario where the interaction between man and food is mediated by an intelligent system that, on the basis of various factors, encourages or discourages the user to eat a specific dish. The main factors that the system need to account for are (1) the diet that the user intends to follow, (2) the food that s/he has eaten in the last days, and (3) the nutritional values of the dishes and their specific recipes. Automatic reasoning and Natural Language Generation (NLG) play a fundamental role in this project: the compatibility of a food with a diet is formalized as a Simple Temporal Problem (STP), while the NLG tries to motivate the user. In this paper we describe these two facilities and their interface. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Dynamic communication between Teachable Agents (TA) and students is crucial for educational effectiveness of the TA, as dynamic interaction is the vital part throughout the teaching and learning processes. Existing TA design mainly focuses on the functions and features to ensure the TA to be taught by students rather than bi-directional interaction. However, according to reciprocity theory in social psychology, if the TA can offer friendly actions, students in response will be much more cooperative and motivated. In order to improve quality of communication and seize the interest of students, we propose a need modeling approach to enable TAs to have “intrinsic motivations”. In this way, the TA can proactively carry out dynamic communication with students so that the TA can adapt to students’ changing behaviors and sustain a good human-agent relationship. Our field study showed that students were highly attracted by the TA with dynamic needs. They statistically completed more tasks. Also, better results were obtained on students’ learning efficiency and attitude towards TA’s informational usefulness and affective interactions. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Lane change behavior is one of the most foundational driving behaviors in microscopic traffic flow. Researching the lane change behavior contributes to improving the simulation accuracy of lane change models and reducing traffic accidents caused by improper lane change behavior. The current lane change model is the decision model mostly based on the way of driver's thinking. The shortcoming of current models is difficult to catch certain potential decision-making model and influencing factors in the driver's decisionmaking process. In view of this, this paper introduces a typical artificial intelligence method, Bayesian networks, to establish a new lane change model, and tries to improve the accuracy of the lane change model by machine learning. It uses a segmented discrete method to preprocess vehicle trajectory measurement data, and uses the processed data to training and verification this model. The verification results show that, this model's recognition rate to lane change behavior can reach more than 88%. In addition, this model can be further applied to the development of a driver assistance system. ©, 2015, Science Press. All right reserved.

AB  - In this paper we present an ambient persuasive system designed to promote balanced participation during group brainstorming. The system gets information from participants’ attention behavior during a brainstorming session and provides visual messages for facilitating balanced participation. In the present study, we investigated the effect that using subtle visual animations and explaining to the users the meaning of the subtle message had on influencing group behavior. Objective measures from data acquired through depth sensors, and subjective responses to questionnaires on usefulness and perceived influence of the technology intervention were collected. The results suggest that the ambient system is better accepted when the persuasive message is expressed in a subtle manner and an explanation of the system’s persuasive strategy is provided. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Grounded in cognitive semantics in cognitive science, the psychology of emotion, and phenomenological approaches to interaction design, this paper first suggests a cognitive and interpretive approach to the imaginative and affective user experiences of “lively” interactive artifacts, which are reminiscent of everyday life experience. It then introduces Swing Compass, an interactive computing system that turns a tablet computer into a compass-like reflective device with artificial intelligence based on an analogy and moderation engine. With configurable analogy and moderation rules and changeable multimedia contents, the device can be instantiated differently, such as “daily activities advisors” or “app-launching guides”, to help people from addiction or decidophobia in various contexts. User experience tests on the device have generated qualitative data showing how it provokes imagination and emotion via conceptual blends and emotional appraisals during different moments. This demonstrates the application of the proposed framework for interpreting users’ meaning-making processes and informing possible orientations of the reflective design in hope of behavior change. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Background: Automated health behavior change interventions show promise, but suffer from high attrition and disuse. The Internet abounds with thousands of personal narrative accounts of health behavior change that could not only provide useful information and motivation for others who are also trying to change, but an endless source of novel, entertaining stories that may keep participants more engaged than messages authored by interventionists. Objective: Given a collection of relevant personal health behavior change stories gathered from the Internet, the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an automated indexing algorithm that could select the best possible story to provide to a user to have the greatest possible impact on their attitudes toward changing a targeted health behavior, in this case weight loss. Methods: An indexing algorithm was developed using features informed by theories from behavioral medicine together with text classification and machine learning techniques. The algorithm was trained using a crowdsourced dataset, then evaluated in a 2×2 between-subjects randomized pilot study. One factor compared the effects of participants reading 2 indexed stories vs 2 randomly selected stories, whereas the second factor compared the medium used to tell the stories: text or animated conversational agent. Outcome measures included changes in self-efficacy and decisional balance for weight loss before and after the stories were read. Results: Participants were recruited from a crowdsourcing website (N=103; 53.4%, 55/103 female; mean age 35, SD 10.8 years; 65.0%, 67/103 precontemplation; 19.4%, 20/103 contemplation for weight loss). Participants who read indexed stories exhibited a significantly greater increase in self-efficacy for weight loss compared to the control group (F1,107=5.5, P=.02). There were no significant effects of indexing on change in decisional balance (F1,97=0.05, P=.83) and no significant effects of medium on change in self-efficacy (F1,107=0.04, P=.84) or decisional balance (F1,97=0.78, P=.38). Conclusions: Personal stories of health behavior change can be harvested from the Internet and used directly and automatically in interventions to affect participant attitudes, such as self-efficacy for changing behavior. Such approaches have the potential to provide highly tailored interventions that maximize engagement and retention with minimal intervention development effort.

AB  - Dialogical argumentation allows agents to interact by constructing and evaluating arguments through a dialogue. Numerous proposals have been made for protocols for dialogical argumentation, and recently there is interest in developing better strategies for agents to improve their own outcomes from the interaction by using an opponent model to guide their strategic choices. However, there is a lack of clear formal reasons for why or how such a model might be useful, or how it can be maintained. In this paper, we consider a simple type of persuasion dialogue, investigate options for using and updating an opponent model, and identify conditions under which such use of a model is beneficial. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The increasing number of people that are overweight due to a sedentary life requires persuasive strategies to convince people to change their behaviors. In this paper, we present a machine learning based technique to recognize and count stairsteps when a person climbs or descends stairs. This technique has been used as part of ClimbTheWorld, a realtime smartphone application that aims at persuading people to use stairs instead of elevators or escalators, since an engaging activity has more chance to change people's life habits. We perform a fine-grained analysis by exploiting smartphone sensors to recognize single stairsteps. Datadependent sliding windows are used facilitating the learning process and reducing the computational cost. Finally, energy consumption is widely investigated to optimize the trade-off between classification precision and battery usage, to avoid exhausting smartphone battery. Copyright © 2014 ICST.

AB  - When making decisions, many people tend to rely on their instinctive choices instead of trusting and adopting those suggested by decision support systems. Feedback interventions can be used to subliminally direct and assist decision makers' attention to increase the accuracy of the decision. This paper seeks to further develop our understanding of such persuasive decision aids for a preferential choice problem. For this purpose, we applied an experiment design with either enabled or disabled feedback interventions in a selfdeveloped computerized decision aid with varying decision complexities. We applied continuous feedback mechanisms using normative rules to evaluate the participants' time investments during their information processing stage. Our findings demonstrate that normative effort feedback impacts both time spent on single items and time spent for overall decision processing. We conclude that effort feedback can be a viable feedback option to implement in decision aids. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Background: Controlling bias is key to successful randomized controlled trials for behaviour change. Bias can be generated at multiple points during a study, for example, when participants are allocated to different groups. Several methods of allocations exist to randomly distribute participants over the groups such that their prognostic factors (e.g., socio-demographic variables) are similar, in an effort to keep participants' outcomes comparable at baseline. Since it is challenging to create such groups when all prognostic factors are taken together, these factors are often balanced in isolation or only the ones deemed most relevant are balanced. However, the complex interactions among prognostic factors may lead to a poor estimate of behaviour, causing unbalanced groups at baseline, which may introduce accidental bias. Methods: We present a novel computational approach for allocating participants to different groups. Our approach automatically uses participants' experiences to model (the interactions among) their prognostic factors and infer how their behaviour is expected to change under a given intervention. Participants are then allocated based on their inferred behaviour rather than on selected prognostic factors. Results: In order to assess the potential of our approach, we collected two datasets regarding the behaviour of participants (n = 430 and n = 187). The potential of the approach on larger sample sizes was examined using synthetic data. All three datasets highlighted that our approach could lead to groups with similar expected behavioural changes. Conclusions: The computational approach proposed here can complement existing statistical approaches when behaviours involve numerous complex relationships, and quantitative data is not readily available to model these relationships. The software implementing our approach and commonly used alternatives is provided at no charge to assist practitioners in the design of their own studies and to compare participants' allocations. © 2014 Giabbanelli and Crutzen; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Argumentation is often seen as a mechanism to support different forms of reasoning such that decision-making and persuasion, but all these approaches assume a purely rational behavior of the involved actors. However, humans are proved to behave differently, mixing rational and emotional attitudes to guide their actions, and it has been claimed that there exists a strong connection between the argumentation process and the emotions felt by people involved in such process. In this paper, we assess this claim by means of an experiment: during several debates people's argumentation in plain English is connected and compared to the emotions automatically detected from the participants. Our results show a correspondence between emotions and argumentation elements, e.g., when in the argumentation two opposite opinions are conflicting this is reflected in a negative way on the debaters' emotions.

AB  - This research adds an action research approach to mixed methods to understand the drivers and barriers to residential waste minimisation in Palmerston North, New Zealand. While local, national, and global structural barriers persisted outside the participants' immediate control, action research enhanced waste minimisation practices within the limits of these structural barriers. The reflexive and collaborative principles of action research allowed research participants to identify individualised needs and challenges. Thus, the research proceeded according to the participants' circumstances. Some of the key drivers included a sense of accountability, active learning, social support, convenience, affordability, and access to information and resources. The participants also offered recommendations to the City Council, producers, and policy-makers to enhance residential waste minimisation in Palmerston North. While the value-action gap persists in purely quantitative waste research seeking to understand and change waste behaviour, action research was beneficial as it added a more nuanced understanding of participants' waste behaviours. It also contextualised waste-related practices and attitudes in a specific locale. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The Tailored Lifestyle Change Decision Aid (TLC DA) system was designed to provide support for a person to make an informed choice about which behavior change to work on when multiple unhealthy behaviors are present. TLC DA can be delivered via web, smartphones and tablets. The system collects a significant amount of information that is used to generate tailored messages to consumers to persuade them in certain healthy lifestyles. One limitation is the necessity to collect vast amounts of information from users who manually enter. By identifying an optimal set of self-reported parameters we will be able to minimize the data entry burden of the app users. The study was to identify primary determinants of health behavior choices made by patients after using the system. Using discriminant analysis an optimal set of predictors was identified. The resulting set included smoking status, smoking cessation success estimate, self-efficacy, body mass index and diet status. Predicting smoking cessation choice was the most accurate, followed by weight management. Physical activity and diet choices were better identified in a combined cluster. © 2015 IMIA and IOS Press.

AB  - In connection with the characteristics of multi-disturbance and nonlinearity of a system for flatness control in cold rolling process, a new intelligent PID control algorithm was proposed based on a cloud model, neural network and fuzzy integration. By indeterminacy artificial intelligence, the problem of fixing the membership functions of input variables and fuzzy rules was solved in an actual fuzzy system and the nonlinear mapping between variables was implemented by neural network. The algorithm has the adaptive learning ability of neural network and the indeterminacy of a cloud model in processing knowledge, which makes the fuzzy system have more persuasion in the process of knowledge inference, realizing the online adaptive regulation of PID parameters and avoiding the defects of the traditional PID controller. Simulation results show that the algorithm is simple, fast and robust with good control performance and application value. © 2014 Central Iron and Steel Research Institute.

AB  - This paper presents a formal model of dialogues in court using a gradual argumentation model. The gradual argumentation model provides computations for the strengths of arguments in an argumentation framework and the degrees of justification of arguments in a gradual argumentation se- mantic. In dialogues in court the adjudicator plays a neutral or active role to decide about burdens and standards of proof in the common law system or in the civil law system. The notions of strength and degree of justification are applied to define the corresponding standards of proof which are suggested as the measurements to assess the burden of production in the argumentation phase and the burden of persuasion in the decision phase. With application of the gradual argumentation model, this paper studies a formal model of dialogues in court. Specifically several new moves for the adjudicator are given within an updated communication language, protocol rules are defined for the adjudicator in accordance with the up- dated communication language are defined, a new notion of Record of commitments (RC) for the adjudicator is added in order to record qualified commitments, and the adjudicator's options in the decision phase are discussed. This paper tests the new model through a criminal case study. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - Online resources, large data repositories and streaming social network messages embed plenitudes of interesting knowledge, often of associative nature. A specific communicative context, such as the political debate in a given country, has groupings of actors, with changing attitudes and stances towards each other and external, real or invented, threats and opportunities. A new form of associative network is introduced, that integrate flexible ontologies for complex contexts of roles and hierarchies with a labelled association structure representing observed strengths and attitudes. Twitter messages from the political landscape in Denmark up to the general election 2015 are used as a both current and relevant illustrative case. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Understanding students’ self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors in open-ended learning environments (OELEs) is an on-going area of research. Whereas OELEs facilitate use of SRL processes, measuring them reliably is difficult. In this paper, we employ coherence analysis, a recently-developed approach to analyzing students’ problem solving behaviors in OELEs, to study how student behaviors change over time as they use an OELE called Betty’s Brain. Results show interesting patterns in students’ day-to-day transitions, and these results can be used to better understand the individual student’s characteristics and the challenges they face when learning in OELEs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Most people participate in meetings almost every day, multiple times a day. The study of meetings is important, but also challenging, as it requires an understanding of social signals and complex interpersonal dynamics. Our aim in this work is to use a data-driven approach to the science of meetings. We provide tentative evidence that: (i) it is possible to automatically detect when during the meeting a key decision is taking place, from analyzing only the local dialogue acts, (ii) there are common patterns in the way social dialogue acts are interspersed throughout a meeting, (iii) at the time key decisions are made, the amount of time left in the meeting can be predicted from the amount of time that has passed, (iv) it is often possible to predict whether a proposal during a meeting will be accepted or rejected based entirely on the language (the set of persuasive words) used by the speaker. © 2014 The Author(s).

AB  - Reasoning about what is best for an agent to do in a particular situation is a challenging task. What makes it even more challenging in a dynamic environment is the existence of norms that aim to regulate a self-interested agent’s behaviour. Practical reasoning is reasoning about what to do in a given situation, particularly in the presence of conflicts between the agent’s practical attitude such as goals, plans and norms. In this paper we: (i) introduce a formal model for normative practical reasoning that allows an agent to plan for multiple and potentially conflicting goals and norms at the same time (ii) identify the best plan(s) for the agent to execute by means of argumentation schemes and critical questions (iii) justify the best plan(s) via an argumentation-based persuasion dialogue for grounded semantics. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is the most common mental health disorder and remains a leading cause of disability and lost productivity with huge costs for society. MDD has high rates of relapse and recurrence, and it has strong correlations with feelings of low social support and disrupted sleep. However, MDD is also commonly misdiagnosed by primary care providers, which leads to delayed treatment and unnecessary suffering. Changes in technology now make it possible to cheaply and effectively monitor social and sleep behaviors, offering the potential of early detection of the onset of MDD. We report on the design of Big Black Dog, a smartphone-based system for gathering data about social and sleep behaviors. We also report on the results of a pilot evaluation to understand the feasibility of gathering and using data from smartphones for inferring the onset of depression. © Copyright 2014, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Persuasion can be used to encourage an individual to change his/her behaviors. However, persuading people in one of multiple behavior stages, such as a degree of achievement of target behavior, requires consideration suitable for each stage. We have proposed a persuasive application that implicitly encourages users to walk continuously in implicit manner. The persuasion is designed to be adapted to the users' estimated current behavior stage. Additionally, this application aims to enable users to walk actively while they play a location-based game and converse with an agent. In this paper, we discuss the design implications of a persuasive conversational agent in an implicitly persuasive application. We specify three aspects: adaptive persuasion, ubiquity and game mechanics. © 2014 SERSC.

AB  - There is a major goal in the mining industry to reduce risks and maintain health in work environments. Moreover, the industry is obliged to monitor the risks in work environment as well as employers’ health statuses. The potentials in using ambient information for the purpose to reduce risks, prevent work-related injuries and monitor health in individuals has been explored. Applications tailored to the individual are being developed to aid the worker in mining or mining-related work environments in valuing the risks of their work situation and create awareness in the individual about how he or she can decrease risks for primarily physical damages. The purpose is to encourage the worker to act upon the level of risk for injuries, and upon the new insights the worker gain from the applications. The identified opportunities for and obstacles to integrating ambient information in these health applications are discussed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - The automotive domain has recently investigated interfaces to persuade drivers to drive safer or in a more sustainable way. So far, these systems are rather technology driven and mostly do not follow a user centered design process. Our aim is to widen the scope of automotive persuasive interfaces and bring the user into the loop. We present a probing study aiming at the identification of persuasion potentials in the car. We describe findings related to inappropriate behavior, past behavior changes, and persuasion for passengers. Our study is a qualitative approach to inform the design of innovative persuasive interfaces in the automotive domain. We present the setup and results of the probing study including a discussion of its potentials and limitations. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Background: A dramatic rise in health-tracking apps for mobile phones has occurred recently. Rich user interfaces make manual logging of users' behaviors easier and more pleasant, and sensors make tracking effortless. To date, however, feedback technologies have been limited to providing overall statistics, attractive visualization of tracked data, or simple tailoring based on age, gender, and overall calorie or activity information. There are a lack of systems that can perform automated translation of behavioral data into specific actionable suggestions that promote healthier lifestyle without any human involvement. Objective: MyBehavior, a mobile phone app, was designed to process tracked physical activity and eating behavior data in order to provide personalized, actionable, low-effort suggestions that are contextualized to the user's environment and previous behavior. This study investigated the technical feasibility of implementing an automated feedback system, the impact of the suggestions on user physical activity and eating behavior, and user perceptions of the automatically generated suggestions. Methods: MyBehavior was designed to (1) use a combination of automatic and manual logging to track physical activity (eg, walking, running, gym), user location, and food, (2) automatically analyze activity and food logs to identify frequent and nonfrequent behaviors, and (3) use a standard machine-learning, decision-making algorithm, called multi-armed bandit (MAB), to generate personalized suggestions that ask users to either continue, avoid, or make small changes to existing behaviors to help users reach behavioral goals. We enrolled 17 participants, all motivated to self-monitor and improve their fitness, in a pilot study of MyBehavior. In a randomized two-group trial, investigators randomly assigned participants to receive either MyBehavior's personalized suggestions (n=9) or nonpersonalized suggestions (n=8), created by professionals, from a mobile phone app over 3 weeks. Daily activity level and dietary intake was monitored from logged data. At the end of the study, an in-person survey was conducted that asked users to subjectively rate their intention to follow MyBehavior suggestions. Results: In qualitative daily diary, interview, and survey data, users reported MyBehavior suggestions to be highly actionable and stated that they intended to follow the suggestions. MyBehavior users walked significantly more than the control group over the 3 weeks of the study (P=.05). Although some MyBehavior users chose lower-calorie foods, the between-group difference was not significant (P=.15). In a poststudy survey, users rated MyBehavior's personalized suggestions more positively than the nonpersonalized, generic suggestions created by professionals (P<.001). Conclusions: MyBehavior is a simple-to-use mobile phone app with preliminary evidence of efficacy. To the best of our knowledge, MyBehavior represents the first attempt to create personalized, contextualized, actionable suggestions automatically from self-tracked information (ie, manual food logging and automatic tracking of activity). Lessons learned about the difficulty of manual logging and usability concerns, as well as future directions, are discussed. © 2015 JMIR Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The collaboration between humans and intelligent agents keeps increasing as the technology advances. In this sense, each can rely on the other's strengths to achieve the best overall performance. But as intelligent agents play an increasingly escalating role as a partner rather than mere tools, it is imperative that we understand how humans are influenced by such agents. This is so as to achieve a certain level of persuasiveness to ensure human compliance with intelligent agents in times of need, and also prevent over-reliance on such agents, which may make humans susceptible to manipulation. Reviewing the literature from human-computer interaction, persuasion, and decision-making processes, this study examined the effect of labelling source expertise (i.e., title) on the human decision-making process, when there is not an agreement between human and robot partners. Specifically, we conducted an experiment (n = 88) to investigate how perceived expertise of a robot resulted in the attractiveness, intelligence and credibility of the robot, and how these perceptions influence the level of cooperation and compliance in a desert survival game. The results showed that participants evaluated the robot as more credible when labelled as expert, compared to when labelled as novice. The results of a mediation analysis also showed that perceived credibility successfully mediated the effect of title on cooperation and compliance when there was a conflict in the ranking order of items between each participant and the robot. Implications for future development of artificial intelligence and future research directions are discussed. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of behaviour change is to help people overcome specific behavioural problems in their everyday life (e.g. helping people to decrease their calorie intake). In current persuasion technology for behaviour change, the emphasis is on helping people to explore their issues (e.g. through questionnaires or game playing) or to remember to follow a behaviour change plan (e.g. diaries and email reminders). So explicit argumentation with consideration of arguments and counterarguments are not supported with existing persuasion technologies. With recent developments in computational models of argument, there is the opportunity for argument-centric persuasion in behaviour change. In this paper, key requirements for this will be presented, together with some discussion of how computational models of argumentation can be harnessed. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Persuasive technologies are gaining ground. As they enter into society they are being applied in more situations, and integrated with other technologies in increasingly smart environments. We argue that this development creates new challenges in designing ethically responsible persuasive technologies. Applications in social contexts like work environments raise the questions whether persuasion serves the interests of the user or the employer, and whether users can still voluntarily choose to use the technology. Informing the user and obtaining consent become complicated when persuasive systems are integrated in smart environments. To ensure that the autonomy of the user is respected, we argue that the user and provider should agree on the goal of persuasion, and users should be informed about persuasion in smart environments. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Many authors have noted that customization increases the effectiveness of persuasive technologies. Also, many empirical demonstrations of successful customization efforts exist in the persuasive technology literature. However, a clear formal framework to describe and evaluate customization is lacking. This leads to the worrisome conclusion that statements like: “customization is beneficial” are often ill-defined given the empirical demonstration at hand. In this paper we forward a formalization of customization to prevent such problems. We derive a number of assumptions regarding the data-generating model that need to be met for customization to be fruitful, and we provide several examples of customization criteria. This paper serves as a discussion piece for the persuasive technology conference to evaluate the use and value of (mathematical) formalizations of customization. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Aggressive driving increases the risk of accidents, and it is normally a consequence of the impatience, frustration, or anger of drivers. In this paper, we present a case study showing the feasibility of using participatory sensing to enable drivers to report and gain awareness on aggressive driving behavior. We describe the design and development of the Driving Habits System prototype, a mobile application that enables drivers deploying sensing campaigns to collect data about their driving habits. We also discuss the results from a 5-weeks deployment study, where 23 drivers used the system in their everyday lives in the city of Ensenada, Mexico. Our results indicate that our prototype was useful and easy to learn. Its design allows drivers to raise awareness on their driving behaviors and motivates them to engage on a participatory sensing campaign to identify issues on the factors that affect driving. We close discussing design issues for ubiquitous applications to be used while driving and the potential impact of such tools in promoting self-reflection and behavior change. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - From Black Holes and Big Bangs to the Higgs boson and the infinitesimal building blocks of all matter, modern science has been spectacularly successful, with one glaring exception - intelligence. Intelligence still remains as one of the greatest mysteries in science. How do you chat so effortlessly? How do you remember, and why do you forget? From a basis of ten maxims What Makes You Clever explains the difficulties as well as the persuasive and persistent over-estimations of progress in Artificial Intelligence. Computers have transformed our lives, and will continue to do so for many years to come. But ever since the Turing Test proposed in 1950 up to IBM’s Deep Blue computer that won the second six-game match against world champion Garry Kasparov, the science of artificial intelligence has struggled to make progress. The reader’s expertise is engaged to probe human language, machine learning, neural computing, holistic systems and emergent phenomenon.

AB  - In recent years, we have seen a prolific rise of mobile and wearable sensing in healthcare and fitness. Although the data generated is incredibly useful, state-of-the-art feedback technologies are often limited to either providing an overall status or serving large volume of multi-dimensional sensor data with little processing. My research falls into filling this gap. I work on developing systems that use sensors to understand different dimensions of well being, and subsequently devise interventions through personalized and actionable suggestions. Using simple machine learning techniques, my systems automatically mine user behaviors that influence specific well-being dimensions. Then utilizing decision theory and behavioral psychology theory, my systems create personalized actionable suggestions that are related to existing user's behaviors. In this proposal, I describe how I realize such automated systems for sensing and providing feedback. Copyright 2014 ACM.

AB  - This paper describes the development and the validation of an ambient system (AAL-VU) that empowers its users in self-management of daily activities and social connectedness. The system combines state-of-the-art psychological knowledge on elderly user requirements for sustained behavior change with modern ICT technology in suggesting an adaptive ambient solution for the prevention and management of chronic diseases, inactivity and loneliness, thus resulting in a higher quality of life. Specifically, the AAL-VU system stimulates beneficial levels of activity in elderly as well as social connectedness. The focus on physical and social activity was chosen as this is recognized as a crucial element for the prevention, cure, and management of many chronic illnesses. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Personalized technologies aim to enhance user experience by taking into account users' interests, preferences, and other relevant information. Persuasive technologies aim to modify user attitudes, intentions, or behavior through computerhuman dialogue and social influence. While both personalized and persuasive technologies influence user interaction and behavior, we posit that this influence could be significantly increased if the two are combined to create personalized and persuasive systems. For example, the persuasive power of a one-size-fits-all persuasive intervention could be enhanced by considering the user being influenced and their susceptibility to the persuasion being offered. Likewise, personalized technologies could cash in on increased successes, in terms of user satisfaction, revenue, and user experience, if their services used persuasive techniques.

AB  - Smart homes for the aging population have recently started attracting the attention of the research community. The “health state” of smart homes is comprised of many different levels; starting with the physical health of citizens, it also includes longer-term health norms and outcomes, as well as the arena of positive behavior changes. One of the problems of interest is to monitor the activities of daily living (ADL) of the elderly, aiming at their protection and well-being. For this purpose, we installed passive infrared (PIR) sensors to detect motion in a specific area inside a smart apartment and used them to collect a set of ADL. In a novel approach, we describe a technology that allows the ground truth collected in one smart home to train activity recognition systems for other smart homes. We asked the users to label all instances of all ADL only once and subsequently applied data mining techniques to cluster in-home sensor firings. Each cluster would therefore represent the instances of the same activity. Once the clusters were associated to their corresponding activities, our system was able to recognize future activities. To improve the activity recognition accuracy, our system preprocessed raw sensor data by identifying overlapping activities. To evaluate the recognition performance from a 200-day dataset, we implemented three different active learning classification algorithms and compared their performance: naive Bayesian (NB), support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF). Based on our results, the RF classifier recognized activities with an average specificity of 96.53%, a sensitivity of 68.49%, a precision of 74.41% and an F-measure of 71.33%, outperforming both the NB and SVM classifiers. Further clustering markedly improved the results of the RF classifier. An activity recognition system based on PIR sensors in conjunction with a clustering classification approach was able to detect ADL from datasets collected from different homes. Thus, our PIR-based smart home technology could improve care and provide valuable information to better understand the functioning of our societies, as well as to inform both individual and collective action in a smart city scenario. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss a novel approach for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for health behavior change. We describe the basic elements of our system architecture, and focus on enabling a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to deliver the health behavior change interventions empathetically by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and non-verbal communication messages to those of its clients. The designed empathy model integrates a cognitive component and an affective components. We then discuss the evaluation experiment that we designed and conducted to evaluate the impact of empathy model on users' experience with the empathic character. Results indicate that, in comparison with the non-empathic counselor, the empathic one is better accepted (e.g., more enjoyable, empathizing, engaging, and likable) and some users might be willing to disclose more private information (e.g., drinking habits) to the counselor endowed with empathic abilities than the one without. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - In this position paper we present the scenario of making interventions for increasing the classical music concert-going behaviour of end users. Within the FP7 Phenicx project we are developing a personalized persuasive system that attempts at changing the concert-going behaviour of users. The system is based on the theory of planned behaviour user model for predicting whether a user will attend a concert or not. Our goal is to develop a machine learning algorithm that will extract the user model parameters unobtrusively from the micro-blogs of the users. We plan to perform a user study to build the training dataset and to test the system on real users within the project.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss a novel approach to design an emotionally responsive system in the context of virtual health interventions for behavior change. We describe the system's design with a focus on enabling a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) to deliver the interventions empathetically. This is done by adapting its verbal and non-verbal behavior, in real-time, to those of the clients. Our current approach is based on a successful existing patient-centered intervention for behavior change - the Drinker's Check-Up (DCU). Although, the DCU uses a text-only web interface, it has been reported to reduce alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users' evaluation of the DCU intervention compared to the same intervention delivered with empathic and non-empathic ECAs. Results show that, the empathic virtual counselor has better acceptance than the other two systems. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - We discuss a large research project aimed at building socially expressive virtual health agents or assistants (VHA) that can deliver brief motivational interventions (BMI) for behavior change, in a communication style that individuals and patients not only accept, but also find emotionally supportive and socially appropriate. Because of their well-defined sequential structure, BMIs lend themselves well to automation, and are adaptable to address a variety of target behaviors, from obesity, to alcohol and drug use, to lack treatment adherence, among others. We discuss the advantages that VHAs provide for the delivery of health interventions. We describe components of our intelligent agent architecture that enables our virtual health agents to dialogue with users in realtime while delivering the appropriate intervention based on the patient’s specific needs at the time. We conclude by identifying open research challenges in developing virtual health agents. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The central debate in the field of neurolaw has focused on two claims. Joshua Greene and Jonathan Cohen argue that we do not have free will and that advances in neuroscience will eventually lead us to stop blaming people for their actions. Stephen Morse, by contrast, argues that we have free will and that the kind of advances Greene and Cohen envision will not and should not affect the law. I argue that neither side has persuasively made the case for or against a revolution in the way the law treats responsibility. There will, however, be a neurolaw revolution of a different sort. It will not necessarily arise from radical changes in our beliefs about criminal responsibility but from a wave of new brain technologies that will change society and the law in many ways, three of which I describe here: First, as new methods of brain imaging improve our ability to measure distress, the law will ease limitations on recoveries for emotional injuries. Second, as neuroimaging gives us better methods of inferring people's thoughts, we will have more laws to protect thought privacy but less actual thought privacy. Finally, improvements in artificial intelligence will systematically change how law is written and interpreted. Copyright © 2014 Adam J. Kolber.

AB  - The application of persuasive technology in web-based and mobile phone-based systems is well established, particularly in the health domain. However, a greater understanding of the effectiveness of the techniques deployed is needed to facilitate the successful transfer of research findings into practical applications. The context explored here is that of creative writing and the potential use of persuasive technology to foster and support a productive writing routine. Employing a user-centered design approach, we conducted surveys and a co-creation workshop with writers. Goal setting and regular writing, combined with self-monitoring, were key indicators of an effective writing practice. Group and mentor support were also highlighted. Based on our findings, we developed the architecture for a mobile personal writing coach. We evaluated the architecture against existing frameworks, finding good congruence. This supports our long-term goal of creating a universal framework, applicable to a wider range of behavior change interventions, domains and users. The design considerations reported in this paper go some way towards that goal. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - In this paper, we present computational models for generating influence that allow story managers to shape players' decisions in interactive narrative experiences. Our approach uses concepts from social psychology, discourse analysis, and natural language generation. We describe an abstract formalism to operationalize tools of social psychological influence described by Cialdini (Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion, New York, NY, USA: Harper-Collins, 1998) and evaluate two example implementations that enable a storytelling system to generate influence on the fly (with varying degrees of success), thereby adapting stories to realize goals specified by authors. These implementations are used in an interactive story where influence is generated dynamically as players' experiences unfold. We present the results of a user study to characterize the effectiveness of these models. Results did not indicate the presence of any significant differences in players' sense of control over the story with, or without, the use of influence. Further, the use of influence resulted in a set of stories experienced by players that more closely matched the author's goals. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This article describes how to design for ambient playful interactions in public spaces, using interactive technology. Ten explorative design cases are presented, all interactive installations with the goal to elicit playful active behavior from teenagers. Following this, we derive three design values, based on literature, user research and the insights from the design cases. These design values describe our best practices for eliciting intrinsically motivating playful interactions: eliciting and seducing passers-by to become players, designing for emergent play to create personalized and changing play, and resonating with users' values, emotions and activities. In addition, insights gained from the cases and evaluations are discussed, and recommendations for implementing playful interactions in public spaces are given. © 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.

AB  - Answer sentence generation is one of the important building blocks to achieve natural and smooth dialog in dialog systems. In conventional answer sentence generation, the system usually responds according to the user's topic or the information required by the user. However, having a dialog using only this information is not necessarily ideal. For example, in a persuasive dialog system that guides the user to the systems goal, only having a dialog according to the user's topic of interest may not achieve the systems goal. In this situation, it is important to be able to generate answers that guide users to topics related to the system goal. To achieve natural transitions from the current topic to the target topic, it is necessary to lead the conversation through related new topics that connect the current topic and the target topics. In this paper, we propose answer sentence generation methods for guiding users to new topics with answer templates. To effectively extract term pairs that apply to the handmade template from a term database, we take advantage of information from a concept dictionary and Web search. In addition, on the assumption that the user does not know the target topic, we prepare an explanation of each topic by hand. We build a dialog system that guides to the goal topic of the system from the input topic, as a method to evaluate if a dialog system using the proposed method can guide to the goal topic. We evaluate single answer sentences and the usage of the proposed method in a dialog system. The experimental results show the efficacy of the generated sentences.

AB  - Collaborative filtering recommendation algorithms are the most popular approaches in the area of recommender systems and have been extensively discussed by researchers. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of items influence received from neighborhood and the corresponding iterative preference prediction based on the influence. Specifically speaking, the proposed approach uses influence coefficient to measure an item's ability to influence neighbors' acceptance by users, and predicts a user's preference for an item based on the user's ratings on these items which have influence on the target item. In the meanwhile, the proposed approach distinguishes influence into persuasive influence and supportive influence, and takes into account the combined effect of the two types of influence. Under this methodology, we verified that the proposed algorithm obviously outperforms standard collaborative filtering methods through 5-fold cross validation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - We introduce a new method for robot control that combines prediction learning with a fixed, crafted response-the robot learns to make a temporally-extended prediction during its normal operation, and the prediction is used to select actions as part of a fixed behavioral response. Our method is inspired by Pavlovian conditioning experiments in which an animal's behavior adapts as it learns to predict an event. Surprisingly the animal's behavior changes even in the absence of any benefit to the animal (i.e. the animal is not modifying its behavior to maximize reward). Our method for robot control combines a fixed response with online prediction learning, thereby producing an adaptive behavior. This method is different from standard non-adaptive control methods and also from adaptive reward-maximizing control methods. We show that this method improves upon the performance of two reactive controls, with visible benefits within 2.5 minutes of real-time learning on the robot. In the first experiment, the robot turns off its motors when it predicts a future over-current condition, which reduces the time spent in unsafe over-current conditions and improves efficiency. In the second experiment, the robot starts to move when it predicts a human-issued request, which reduces the apparent latency of the human-robot interface. © Copyright 2013, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - Computational models of argument could play a valuable role in persuasion technologies for behaviour change (e.g. persuading a user to eat a more healthy diet, or to drink less, or to take more exercise, or to study more conscientiously, etc). For this, the system (the persuader) could present arguments to convince the user (the persuadee). In this paper, we consider asymmetric dialogues where only the system presents arguments, and the system maintains a model of the user to determine the best choice of arguments to present (including counterarguments to key arguments believed to be held by the user). The focus of the paper is on the user model, including how we update it as the dialogue progresses, and how we use it to make optimal choices for dialogue moves.

AB  - Besides other popular strategies, such as feedback and (social) comparisons, challenges have been proposed and used to influence people’s behavior towards a targeted goal. However, only very limited data on the effectiveness of such approaches and how to best design them is available yet. In this work we report the findings of a two months field study analyzing the effectiveness and perception of challenges in the context of influencing personal mobility. Individual and collaborative approaches towards challenges were studied, and specific focus was laid on what aspect makes users willing to participate in these challenges. Our findings suggest that both individual and collaborative challenges have the potential to sustain the interest of users in using behavior change support systems, that collaborative and individual challenges seem to not attract different types of users, that individual challenges in general are preferred, and that challenges are only a useful means for a subset of users. Also, ICT-competence seems to be an important aspect of being willing to participate in electronically organized challenges. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The discussion about the implications of new or digital media focuses mainly on 'social' media. This reduction is a conceptual shortcoming. In order to fully understand how digital media impact on society and the communication landscape, our conceptualisation needs to include new entertainment media, especially computer games. Interactivity here might mean interaction with the AI (artificial intelligence) or human players or both, but the crucial difference lies in the fact that the interaction takes place in a 'world' created by the software. Despite the discussion about 'gamification' in marketing and a tradition of game studies in the humanities, there have been few attempts to treat computer games not only as trivial culture, but as a "persuasive device", as a way to shape public opinion. This article explores how the theory of procedural rhetoric, as outlined by Ian Bogost, enhances our understanding of this growing area. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper studies the influence of superstars on spectators in cinema marketing. Casting superstars is a common risk-mitigation strategy in the cinema industry. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the presence of superstars is not always a guarantee of success and hence, a deeper study is required to analyze the potential audience of a movie. In this sense, knowledge, attitudes and emotions of spectators towards stars are analyzed as potential factors of influencing the intention of seeing a movie with stars in its cast. This analysis is performed through machine learning techniques. In particular, the problem is stated as an ordinal classification/regression task rather than a traditional classification or regression task, since the intention of watching a movie is measured in a graded scale, hence, its values exhibit an order. Several methods are discussed for this purpose, but Support Vector Ordinal Regression shows its superiority over other ordinal classification/regression techniques. Moreover, exhaustive experiments carried out confirm that the formulation of the problem as an ordinal classification/regression is a success, since powerful traditional classifiers and regressors show worse performance. The study also confirms that talent and popularity expressed by means of knowledge, attitude and emotions satisfactorily explain superstar persuasion. Finally, the impact of these three components is also checked. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - For Internet applications like sponsored search, cautions need to be taken when using machine learning to optimize their mechanisms (e.g., auction) since self-interested agents in these applications may change their behaviors (and thus the data distribution) in response to the mechanisms. To tackle this problem, a framework called game-theoretic machine learning (GTML) was recently proposed, which first learns a Markov behavior model to characterize agents behaviors, and then learns the optimal mechanism by simulating agents' behavior changes in response to the mechanism. While GTML has demonstrated practical success, its generalization analysis is challenging because the behavior data are non-i.i.d. and dependent on the mechanism. To address this challenge, first, we decompose the generalization error for GTML into the behavior learning error and the mechanism learning error; second, for the behavior learning error, we obtain novel non-asymptotic error bounds for both parametric and non-parametric behavior learning methods; third, for the mechanism learning error, we derive a uniform convergence bound based on a new concept called nested covering number of the mechanism space and the generalization analysis techniques developed for mixing sequences. © Copyright 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaa1.org).

AB  - Research has shown that there are differences in how males and females respond to persuasive attempts. This paper examines the persuasiveness of the six persuasive strategies - Reciprocity, Scarcity, Authority, Commitment and Consistency, Consensus and Liking developed by Cialdini with respect to age and gender. The results of the large-scale study (N = 1108) show that males and females differ significantly in their responsiveness to the strategies. Overall, females are more responsive to most of the strategies than males and some strategies are more suitable for persuading one gender than the other. The results of our study also reveal some differences between younger adults and adults with respect to the persuasiveness of the strategies. Finally, the results show that irrespective of gender and age, there are significant differences between the strategies regarding their perceived persuasiveness overall, shedding light on the comparative effectiveness of the strategies. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Adapting behavior to accommodate changes in the environment is an important function of the nervous system. A universal problem for motile animals is the discovery that a learned route is blocked and a detour is required. Given the substantial neuroscience research on spatial navigation and decision-making it is surprising that so little is known about how the brain solves the detour problem. Here we review the limited number of relevant functional neuroimaging, single unit recording and lesion studies. We find that while the prefrontal cortex (PFC) consistently responds to detours, the hippocampus does not. Recent evidence suggests the hippocampus tracks information about the future path distance to the goal. Based on this evidence we postulate a conceptual model in which: Lateral PFC provides a prediction error signal about the change in the path, frontopolar and superior PFC support the re-formulation of the route plan as a novel subgoal and the hippocampus simulates the new path. More data will be required to validate this model and understand (1) how the system processes the different options; and (2) deals with situations where a new path becomes available (i.e., shortcuts). © 2015 Spiers and Gilbert.

AB  - In this article, we study automated agents that are designed to encourage humans to take some actions over others by strategically disclosing key pieces of information. To this end, we utilize the framework of persuasion games-a branch of game theory that deals with asymmetric interactions where one player (Sender) possesses more information about the world, but it is only the other player (Receiver) who can take an action. In particular, we use an extended persuasion model, where the Sender's information is imperfect and the Receiver has more than two alternative actions available. We design a computational algorithm that, from the Sender's standpoint, calculates the optimal information disclosure rule. The algorithm is parameterized by the Receiver's decision model (i.e., what choice he will make based on the information disclosed by the Sender) and can be retuned accordingly. We then provide an extensive experimental study of the algorithm's performance in interactions with human Receivers. First, we consider a fully rational (in the Bayesian sense) Receiver decision model and experimentally show the efficacy of the resulting Sender's solution in a routing domain. Despite the discrepancy in the Sender's and the Receiver's utilities from each of the Receiver's choices, our Sender agent successfully persuaded human Receivers to select an option more beneficial for the agent. Dropping the Receiver's rationality assumption, we introduce a machine learning procedure that generates a more realistic human Receiver model. We then show its significant benefit to the Sender solution by repeating our routing experiment. To complete our study, we introduce a second (supply-demand) experimental domain and, by contrasting it with the routing domain, obtain general guidelines for a Sender on how to construct a Receiver model. © 2014 ACM.

AB  - Accurate wording is essential in persuasive verbal communication. Through it speakers can provide an affective connotation to the text and reveal their disposition or induce a similar disposition on the recipient. All this is apparent in persuasion texts par excellence, such as political speech and advertisement. Automatic sentiment variations of existing linguistic expressions open the way to promising applications, yet it is a challenging problem. In this paper we describe a system which takes up this challenge, together with a framework for evaluating the persuasiveness of the newly produced expressions. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - This paper presents the way to design the continuous learning process model based on general reinforcement learning framework for both a human and a learning agent. The objective of this research is to bring the learning ability of the learning agent close to that of a human. We focus on both the reinforcement learning framework for the learning agent and the continuous learning model of a human.However, there are two kinds of questions. First question is how to bridge an enormous gap between them. To fill in the missing piece of reinforcement learning whose learning process is mainly behavior change, we add two mental learning processes, awareness as pre-learning process and reflection as post-learning process. Second question is how to observe mental learning processes of a human. Previous methods of human learning researches mostly depend on observable behaviors or activities. On the other hand, a learning process of a human has a major difficulty in observing since it is a mental process. Then a human learning process is yet-to-be-defined. So it is necessary to add a new twist to observe the learning process of a human. To solve this, we propose a new method for visualizing mental learning processes with invisible mazes consisting of invisible walls which are perceived as a sign that is the number of walls in the neighborhood. Besides, we add meta-actions for expressing and summarizing something to be aware of learning from mistake or to be reflected on learning from experience. A learner can mark up his/her sign-action traces by meta-actions for future success. It turns out to visualize his/her mental learning processes. This paper reports our learning support system for a human learner to visualize his/her mental learning processes with invisible mazes for continuous learning. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Software component reuse is deemed as an effective technique for managing the growing software complexity of large systems. Software complexity can also be reduced by partitioning the system behavior into different modes. Such a multi-mode system can change behavior by switching between modes under certain circumstances. Integrating component reuse and the multi-mode approach, we have developed the Mode Switch Logic (MSL), a framework dedicated to the development of multi-mode systems composed by reusable multi-mode components, i.e. components which can run in different modes. The mode switch handling of MSL is based on a fully distributed architecture in the sense that a system mode switch is achieved by the joint mode switches of different independently developed components. In this paper, we propose a mode transformation technique as a supplement to MSL for converting the distributed mode switch handling of MSL to a centralized mode switch handling. The goal is to enhance the run-time mode switch efficiency when components are deployed on a single hardware platform and global mode information is available. We demonstrate this technique by an example and reveal its potential industrial value. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - The emerging discipline of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed attitudes towards the intellect, which was long considered to be a feature exclusively belonging to biological beings, i.e. homo sapiens. In 1956, when the concept of Artificial Intelligence emerged, discussions began about whether the intellect may be more than an inherent feature of a biological being, i.e. whether it can be artificially created. AI can be defined on the basis of the factor of a thinking human being and in terms of a rational behavior: (i) systems that think and act like a human being; (ii) systems that think and act rationally. These factors demonstrate that AI is different from conventional computer algorithms. These are systems that are able to train themselves (store their personal experience). This unique feature enables AI to act differently in the same situations, depending on the actions previously performed. The ability to accumulate experience and learn from it, as well as the ability to act independently and make individual decisions, creates preconditions for damage. Factors leading to the occurrence of damage identified in the article confirm that the operation of AI is based on the pursuit of goals. This means that with its actions AI may cause damage for one reason or another; and thus issues of compensation will have to be addressed in accordance with the existing legal provisions. The main issue is that neither national nor international law recognizes AI as a subject of law, which means that AI cannot be held personally liable for the damage it causes. In view of the foregoing, a question naturally arises: who is responsible for the damage caused by the actions of Artificial Intelligence? In the absence of direct legal regulation of AI, we can apply article 12 of United Nations Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts, which states that a person (whether a natural person or a legal entity) on whose behalf a computer was programmed should ultimately be responsible for any message generated by the machine. Such an interpretation complies with a general rule that the principal of a tool is responsible for the results obtained by the use of that tool since the tool has no independent volition of its own. So the concept of AI-as-Tool arises in the context of AI liability issues, which means that in some cases vicarious and strict liability is applicable for AI actions. © 2015 Paulius Čerka, Jurgita Grigienė & Gintarė Sirbikytė.

AB  - Smoking cessation has become a real social challenge in healthcare domain and persuasive technologies combined with ambient intelligence figure as a possible approaches against this addiction. Choosing an effective persuasive design relies on different models and principles coming from several scientific contexts. We evaluate the triggers defined by the B.J.Fogg’s model in different design strategies implementing three experiments: the first using smoking tools, the second with an Android application and a third one using the same application coupled with an Arduino-based ambient device. The CRegrette system’s proof of concept suggests that statistics combined with an ambient device are more effective than notifications, mirroring and self-monitoring approaches. This article furthermore proposes some design strategies and research perspectives to support further research in the field of persuasion and ambient device design. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Unsafe driving has a negative effect on society and its citizens since it leads to traffic accidents. Most states penalize unsafe driving; however, this potential for penalization does not change how people drive and alternate ways must be found. With the aim of persuading people to change how they drive, we propose to gamify the driving activity through ambient devices that provide drivers with awareness about their driving behavior. In this paper, we present the design of ambient devices that we propose to offer a seamless drivers’ interaction with a game that challenge players to avoid risky driving behaviors. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Despite a tremendous increase in the online sales of experiential products (e.g., clothes), how to present such kind of products to better intrigue online consumers remains unsolved. Relative to model presentation (i.e., presented by professional models), peer presentation (i.e., presented by peer consumers) is emerging as a new way of IT-enabled product presentation welcomed by online clothing merchants. Drawing on the Construal Level Theory, we examine the effects of peer presentation vs. model presentation, and the fitness between recommendation messages and these two types of presentation. We propose that compared to model presentation, peer presentation yields a closer psychological distance to a consumer, and is likely to arouse a lower level mental construal of the consumer. Thus, alongside peer presentation, a recommendation message that fits a low level construal (i.e., secondary features) is more persuasive. Contrarily, alongside model presentation, a recommendation message that fits a high level construal (i.e., primary features) is more persuasive. Lab experiments and a field experiment are designed to test these hypotheses. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - We developed a virtual counseling system which can deliver brief alcohol health interventions via a 3D anthropomorphic speech-enabled interface—a new field for spoken dialog interactions with intelligent virtual agents in the health domain. We present our spoken dialog system design and its evaluation. We developed our dialog system based on Markov decision processes framework and optimized it by using reinforcement learning algorithms with data we collected from real user interactions. The system begins to learn optimal dialog strategies for initiative selection and for the type of confirmations that it uses during the interaction. We compared the unoptimized system with the optimized system in terms of objective measures (e.g. task completion) and subjective measures (e.g. ease of use, future intention to use the system) and obtained positive results. © 2014, OpenInterface Association.

AB  - In this paper, we report our attempt to realize analogical abduction as an extension of our work on meta level abductive framework for rule abduction and predicate invention. In our previous work, we gave a set of axioms to state the object level causalities in terms of first-order-logic (FOL) clauses, which represent direct and indirect causalities by transitive rules. Here we extend our formalism of the meta level abductive reasoning by adding rules to conduct analogical inference. We apply our analogical abduction method to the problem of explaining the difficult cello playing techniques of spiccato, rapid cross strings of the bow movement and one-bow staccato. Our method constructs persuasive analogical explanations about how to play them. We use a model of forced vibration mechanics as the base world for spiccato, the specification of the skeletal structure of the hand as the basis for the cross string bowing technique and behavioral similarity for one-bow staccato, respectively. These experimental studies suggest effectiveness of our approach to realize skill acquisition support by giving persuasive explanations of knacks provided by experts through analogical abduction. © The Japanese Society for Artificial Intelligence 2014.

AB  - The Computer-Support Collaborative Learning (CSCL) script is an effective approach to support meaningful interactions and better learning. Unfortunately, in some situations, scripted collaboration demotivates students, which makes more difficult its use over time. To deal with this problem, we propose the use of gamification to positively change learners’ motivation and engagement. Nevertheless, the adequate application of gamification is a complex task that requires deeper knowledge about game design and their impact on collaborative learning (CL). Thus, we develop an ontology called OntoGaCLeS to provide a formal systematization of the knowledge about gamification and its correct application. In this paper, we focus in the formalization of concepts relate to gamification as persuasive technology. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - We propose a definition of symbiotic interaction that is informed by current developments in computing. We clearly distinguish this definition from previous ones and from selected paradigms that address the human-computer relationship. The definition is also informed by a variety of human-centered frameworks in human-computer interaction, including embodied interactions, situationist frameworks, and participatory and work-oriented design perspectives. Symbiotic interactions can be achieved by combining computation, sensing technology, and interaction design to realize deep perception, awareness, and understanding between humans and computers. Important aspects to implement are transparency, reciprocity, and collaborative use of resources for both computers and humans. The symbiotic relationship is also characterized by goals and agency independence of humans and computers. The definition sets the premise to discuss in a critical way future research agendas for symbiotic interactions that are sensitive to human-centered values. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - Named-Entity Recognizers (NERs) are an important part of information extraction systems in annotation tasks. Although substantial progress has been made in recognizing domain-independent named entities (e.g. location, organization and person), there is a need to recognize named entities for domain-specific applications in order to extract relevant concepts. Due to the growing need for smart health applications in order to address some of the latest worldwide epidemics of behavioral issues (e.g. over eating, lack of exercise, alcohol and drug consumption), we focused on the domain of behavior change, especially lifestyle change. To the best of our knowledge, there is no named-entity recognizer designed for the lifestyle change domain to enable applications to recognize relevant concepts. We describe the design of an ontology for behavioral health based on which we developed a NER augmented with lexical resources. Our NER automatically tags words and phrases in sentences with relevant (lifestyle) domain-specific tags (e.g. [un/]healthy food, potentially-risky/healthy activity, drug, tobacco and alcoholic beverage). We discuss the evaluation that we conducted with with manually collected test data. In addition, we discuss how our ontology enables systems to make further information acquisition for the recognized named entities by using semantic reasoners.

AB  - Persuasive computing has tended to be applied toward the promotion of minor behavior change in the direction of easily understood and uncontroversial goals. Such approaches may not make sense, however, when designing for so called 'wicked problems'. We argue that while wicked problems can be effectively addressed through persuasive technology, a 'designerly' (as opposed to engineering or experimental psychology) approach is required in their creation. We illustrate this approach through the design of our own persuasive system directed at the wicked problem of encouraging local spending, and we draw lessons for persuasive design more generally. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Database Management System (DBMS) is used as a data source with financial, educational, web and other applications from last many years. Users are connected with the DBMS to update existing records and retrieving reports by executing workloads that consist of complex queries. In order to get the sufficient level of performance, arrangement of workloads is necessary. Rapid growth in data, maximum functionality and changing behavior tends the database workload to be more complex and tricky. Each DBMS experiences complex workloads that are difficult to manage by the humans; human experts take much time to manage database workload efficiently; even in some cases it may become impossible and leads toward malnourishment. This problem leads database practitioners, vendors and researchers toward new challenges. To achieve a satisfactory level of performance, either Database Administrator (DBA) or DBMSs must have the knowledge about the workload shifts. Efficient execution and resource allocation of workload is dependent on the workload type that may be either On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) or Decision Support System (DSS). The research introduces a way to manage the workload in DBMSs on the basis of the workload type. The main goal of the research is to manage the workload in DBMSs through characterization, scheduler and idleness detection modules. The database workload management is performed by using the case based reasoning characterization; Fuzzy logic based scheduling and finally detection of CPU Idleness. Results are validated through experiments that are performed on real time and benchmark workload to reveal effectiveness and efficiency. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Given the fast rise of increasingly autonomous artificial agents and robots, a key acceptability criterion will be the possible moral implications of their actions. In particular, intelligent persuasive systems (systems designed to influence humans via communication) constitute a highly sensitive topic because of their intrinsically social nature. Still, ethical studies in this area are rare and tend to focus on the output of the required action. Instead, this work focuses on the persuasive acts themselves (e.g. "is it morally acceptable that a machine lies or appeals to the emotions of a person to persuade her, even if for a good end?")- Exploiting a behavioral approach, based on human assessment of moral dilemmas - i.e. without any prior assumption of underlying ethical theories - This paper reports on a set of experiments. These experiments address the type of persuader (human or machine), the strategies adopted (purely argumentative, appeal to positive emotions, appeal to negative emotions, lie) and the circumstances. Findings display no differences due to the agent, mild acceptability for persuasion and reveal that truth-conditional reasoning (i.e. argument validity) is a significant dimension affecting subjects' judgment. Some implications for the design of intelligent persuasive systems are discussed. © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract Interactive conflict resolution and peace education have developed as two major lines of practice to tackle intractable inter-group conflicts. Recently, new media technologies such as social media, computer games, and online dialogue are added to the existing set of tools used for peace education. However, a debate is emerging as to how effective they are in motivating learning and teaching skills required for peace building. We take issue with this question and have conducted a study investigating the effect of different conflict contexts on student learning. We have designed a cross-national experimental study with Israeli-Jewish, Palestinian, and Guatemalan undergraduate students using the Israeli-Palestinian and Guatemalan scenarios in the computer game called "Global Conflicts." The learning effects of these scenarios were systematically analyzed using pre- and post-test questionnaires. The study indicated that Israeli-Jews and Palestinians acquired more knowledge from the Guatemalan game than Guatemalans acquired from the Israeli-Palestinian game. All participants acquired knowledge about proximate conflicts after playing games about these scenarios, and there were insignificant differences between the three national groups. Israeli-Jews and Palestinians playing the Israeli-Palestinian game changed their attitudes about this conflict, while Guatemalans playing the Guatemalan game did not change their attitudes about this case. All participants changed their attitudes about distant conflicts after playing games about these scenarios. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - While a variety of persuasion agents have been created and applied in different domains such as marketing, military training and health industry, there is a lack of a model which can provide a unified framework for different persuasion strategies. Specifically, persuasion is not adaptable to the individuals' personal states in different situations. Grounded in the Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM), this paper presents a computational model called Model for Adaptive Persuasion (MAP) for virtual agents. MAP is a semi-connected network model which enables an agent to adapt its persuasion strategies through feedback. We have implemented and evaluated a MAP-based virtual nurse agent who takes care and recommends healthy lifestyle habits to the elderly. Our experimental results show that the MAP-based agent is able to change the others' attitudes and behaviors intentionally, interpret individual differences between users, and adapt to user's behavior for effective persuasion.

AB  - Online security advice aims to persuade users to behave securely, but appears to have limited effects at changing behaviour. We propose security advice targeted at end-users should employ visual rhetoric to form an effective, memorable, and persuasive method of communication. We present the design and evaluation of infographics and an online interactive comic developed to persuade users to update their antivirus software. Results show superior learning and behavioural outcomes compared to mainstream text-only security advice. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases belong to the most common causes of death. Telehealth applications can help to improve therapy and support behavior change. It was the objective of the present work to construct and evaluate within a trial (25 patients) an automated feedback system for a telehealth application to support behavior change. We used a rule-based approach and constructed 26 rules in 9 categories. Rule design and implementation followed the principles of the Austrian Medical Product Law, resulting in an automated rule-based feedback system. Evaluations show high user satisfaction with 80% of all users perceiving the system as useful. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - A requirement of an Agent-based Simulation (ABS) is that the agents must be able to adapt to their environment. Many ABSs achieve this adaption through simple threshold equations due to the complexity of incorporating more sophisticated approaches. Threshold equations are when an agent behavior changes because a numeric property of the agent goes above or below a certain threshold value. Threshold equations do not guarantee that the agents will learn what is best for them. Reinforcement learning is an artificial intelligence approach that has been extensively applied to multiagent systems but there is very little in the literature on its application to ABS. Reinforcement learning has previously been applied to discrete-event simulations with promising results; thus, reinforcement learning is a good candidate for use within an Agent-based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) environment. This paper uses an established insurgency case study to show some of the consequences of applying reinforcement learning to ABMS, for example, determining whether any actual learning has occurred. The case study was developed using the Repast Simphony software package. © 2013 The Society for Modeling.

AB  - Autonomous agents operating in a dynamic environment must be able to reason and make decisions about actions in pursuit of their goals. In addition, in a normative environment an agent's actions are not only directed by the agent's goals, but also by the norms imposed on the agent. Practical reasoning is reasoning about what to do in a given situation, particularly in the presence of conflicts between the agent's practical attitude such as goals, plans and norms. In this thesis we aim: (i) to introduce a model for normative practical reasoning that allows the agents to plan for multiple and potentially conflicting goals and norms at the same time (ii) to implement the model both formally and computationally, (iii) to identify the best plan for the agent to execute by means of argumentation framework and grounded semantics, (iv) to justify the best plan via argumentation-based persuasion dialogue for grounded semantics.

AB  - Gamification is a growing phenomenon of interest to both practitioners and researchers. There remains, however, uncertainty about the contours of the field. Defining gamification as "the process of making activities more game-like" focuses on the crucial space between the components that make up games and the holistic experience of gamefulness. It better fits real-world examples and connects gamification with the literature on persuasive design. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Prior research demonstrated that message receivers’ primary and secondary communication goals are important predictors of their evaluation of online persuasive messages. The present study was undertaken to illuminate the process by which these communication goals are applied in response to received messages. The findings demonstrate that communication goals are applied immediately upon viewing even a simple message directory listing containing subject, sender, and date information. Once activated, communication goals significantly predict intention to comply with a message request, although predictiveness increases substantially when the complete message is read. Further analysis suggests that message receivers’ communication goals can offer rich explanations of the cognitive processes that are used to evaluate online persuasive messages. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - In order to examine ideas on extended mind I will be looking at the writing of its exponents and its critics and using examples of cognitive systems from daily life and from research. I will show that the notion of extended mind, when linked with regularly cited examples, is at best a weak argument; at worst these examples are not part of any kind of cognitive system at all and are simply a way of retrieving and using information. The notion of extended mind depends on external elements (outside skin and skull) being integrated into the cognitive system such that the unconscious cognitive function is affected thus changing this function. I will show that the external components of the integrated system do not need to hold reliable information that fit with beliefs, mimic memory or support changing behaviour, as some writers would have it; instead the key to whether some external object or set of information is part of a cognitive system is dependent on the level of transparent integration within an unconscious part of that system.

AB  - Although it is important for our daily lives and works to keep things tidy and in order, it is difficult to always keep it especially in the shared space because it is unclear who has the responsibility. In this study, therefore, a method to persuade them to change their daily behaviors has been proposed from the concept of Ambient Intelligence. In order to realize the method, a system has been developed to encourage them to keep things tidy and in order by personifying the shared space. The personified system expresses its emotions in response to the degree of the disorder. The system consists of (1) a disorder estimation function from the captured image of the shared space by a camera, (2) an emotion creation function of the personified space by the transition of the disorder, and (3) an emotion expression function in appropriate timing. In addition, a case study had been conducted for 31 days to evaluate the system in a student room of a laboratory. As the result, the longer they stayed in the room, the more they watched the messages of the personified room, and improved their consciousness and habituation of keeping the room in order. However, the users who rarely stayed in the room did not improve the habituation. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper proposes a new way to gamify the micro-crowdfunding service. Micro-crowdfunding is a crowdsourcing service to achieve a sustainable society based on a crowdfunding concept and an aging money concept. In this type of service, each activity to achieve a sustainable society is called a mission, and performing a mission is encouraged through social and economic incentives. A new approach described in this paper enhances the original strategies by using a game concept. The approach consists of two techniques. The first technique adopts several concepts from dramaturgy. The technique coordinates multiple missions and encourages people to complete them by providing a fictional goal that most people want to achieve. The second technique incorporates persuasive ambient mirrors that reflect people's current situation with visual and fictional expressions. The technique emotionally increases people's incentives by using operant conditioning. We also conduct a user study to validate the approach proposed in this paper. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Coordination with an unknown human teammate is a notable challenge for cooperative agents. Behavior of human players in games with cooperating AI agents is often sub-optimal and inconsistent leading to choreographed and limited cooperative scenarios in games. This paper considers the difficulty of cooperating with a teammate whose goal and corresponding behavior change periodically. Previous work uses Bayesian models for updating beliefs about cooperating agents based on observations. We describe belief models for on-line planning, discuss tuning in the presence of noisy observations, and demonstrate empirically its effectiveness in coordinating with inconsistent agents in a simple domain. Further work in this area promises to lead to techniques for more interesting cooperative AI in games. Copyright © 2015, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

AB  - In this paper the feasibility to extract the proportion of pigs located in different areas of a pig pen by advanced image analysis technique is explored and discussed for possible applications. For example, pigs generally locate themselves in the wet dunging area at high ambient temperatures in order to avoid heat stress, as wetting the body surface is the major path to dissipate the heat by evaporation. Thus, the portion of pigs in the dunging area and resting area, respectively, could be used as an indicator of failure of controlling the climate in the pig environment as pigs are not supposed to rest in the dunging area. The computer vision methodology utilizes a learning based segmentation approach using several features extracted from the image. The learning based approach applied is based on extended state-of-the-art features in combination with a structured prediction framework based on a logistic regression solver using elastic net regularization. In addition, the method is able to produce a probability per pixel rather than form a hard decision. This overcomes some of the limitations found in a setup using grey-scale information only. The pig pen is a difficult imaging environment because of challenging lighting conditions like shadows, poor lighting and poor contrast between pig and background. In order to test practical conditions, a pen containing nine young pigs was filmed from a top view perspective by an Axis M3006 camera with a resolution of 640×480 in three, 10-min sessions under different lighting conditions. The results indicate that a learning based method improves, in comparison with greyscale methods, the possibility to reliable identify proportions of pigs in different areas of the pen. Pigs with a changed behaviour (location) in the pen may indicate changed climate conditions. Changed individual behaviour may also indicate inferior health or acute illness. © The Animal Consortium 2015.

As a case study, we introduce our approach that aims to enhance healthy eating behavior by planting an easy choice. We conducted an experiment in which boiled pumpkins were placed on the counter as an alternative choice to extra rice bowls in the university cafeteria. Our experiment showed that the dietary behaviors of students could be improved easily by a simple shikake. © 2015 AI Access Foundation. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper deals with an approach to opponent-modelling in argumentation-based persuasion dialogues. It assumes that dialogue participants (agents) have models of their opponents’ knowledge, which can be augmented based on previous dialogues. Specifically, previous dialogues indicate relationships of support, which refer both to arguments as abstract entities and to their logical constituents. The augmentation of an opponent model relies on these relationships. An argument external to an opponent model can augment that model with its logical constituents, if that argument shares support relationships with other arguments that can be constructed from that model. The likelihood that the constituents of supporting arguments will in fact be known to an opponent, varies according to support types. We therefore provide corresponding quantifications for each support type. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper uses kiteboarding as an experimental platform to find ways in which technologies could support communication needs in mentally and physically demanding contexts. A kite control bar with embedded sensors and actuators communicates instructions through voice or tactile cues to explore facilitating communication for control guidance. Tactile cues were shown to be productive in changing behavior. Voice, however, communicated planning models and directional guidance better than tactile cues. Still, voice may negatively impact experience. The experiments highlight the need for better ways for communication tools to support mental models. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2015.

AB  - Embodied conversational agents (ECA) are a type of intelligent, multimodal computer interface that allow computers to interact with humans in a face-to-face manner. It is quite feasible that ECAs will someday replace the common keyboard as a human-computer interface. However, we have much to understand about how people interact with such embodied virtual agents. In this study, we performed a laboratory experiment, in an airport screening context, to assess how people's linguistic behavior changes with their perceptions of the ECA's power and likeability. The results show that people tend to manifest more verbal immediacy and expressivity, as well as offer more information about themselves, with ECAs they perceive as more likeable and less powerful. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Internet interventions have been shown to be effective for treatment of mental health complaints. Although non-adherence poses a problem, persuasive technology might be a solution. However, there is limited insight in how and why technology may lead to more adherence and effectiveness. This study explores the role of involvement in a Behavior Change Support System (BCSS) for treatment of depression. Involvement is seen as an important factor in the success of treatment, but has received little research attention. This study expands on an earlier study and uses self-reported data to explore differences between versions of the BCSS on involvement. The results show that involvement and adherence are related, but involvement outperforms adherence as predictor for effectiveness. This underlines the importance of involvement: it may be a working mechanism of persuasive technology and may be used as an early measure to assess whether the intervention is likely to reach its goals. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - This paper presents a design space for persuasive cooperative persuasive interactions for mobile exertion applications. This type of software bridges entertainment with workout activities, providing users with intuitive and fun ways to track their performances. Persuasion and, in particular, cooperative interactions play a pivotal role in user motivation - they are paramount to convince individuals to pursue their goals and overcome obstacles. Applications of this type have started to offer more diverse functionalities, often becoming difficult to label and pinpoint the type of design cues being employed to foster these persuasive and cooperative facets. In this article we propose a design space for this type of features in such software. The design exercise roots itself in existing literature and the results for an online survey we deployed to assess usage habits for this type of applications. Validation is underway and will be achieved via the creation of an application that covers the proposed dimensions. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Semi-supervised stream clustering performs cluster analysis of data streams by exploiting background or domain expert knowledge. Almost of existing semi-supervised stream clustering techniques exploit background knowledge as constraints such as must-link and cannotlink constraints. The use of constraints is not appropriate with respect to the dynamic nature of data streams. In this paper, we proposed a new semi-supervised stream clustering algorithm, SSE-Stream. SSE-Stream exploits background knowledge in the form of single labeled data points to monitor and detect change of the clustering structure evolution. Exploiting background knowledge as single labeled data points is more appropriate for data streams. They can be immediately utilised for determining the class of clusters, and effectively support the changing behavior of data streams. SSE-Stream defines new cluster representation to include labeled data points, and uses it to extend the clustering operations such as merge and split for detecting change of the clustering structure evolution. Experimental results on real-world stream datasets show that SSE-Stream is able to improve the output clustering quality, especially for highly complex and drift datasets. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The most important ethical question regarding PTs is the voluntariness of changes they bring about. Coercive technologies control its users by application of direct force or credible threat. Manipulative technologies control their users by influencing them in ways of which the users are not aware and cannot control. As a result, both violate the voluntariness condition of the standard definition of PTs. Any voluntariness assessment needs to consider whether there are external controlling influences and whether the user acts intentionally. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Despite the large number of eHealth projects to date and the positive outcomes of evaluation studies, the adherence to eHealth interventions is lower than expected. To understand how persuasive technology can influence the adherence to eHealth interventions process data (log-data) about the usage of technology (system and content) can provide a starting point for employment of persuasive features into the design of technology. The log-data of the usage of an eMental health intervention used as an example in this paper, contained a record of actions taken by each participant with for each action the following information: user-id; action type; action specification; time and day. The log-data showed critical episodes for employment of persuasive components to increase adherence: episodes to determine the willingness to follow a therapy, awareness of their non-coping strategies, adoption of "new" skills for behavior change. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Most people participate in meetings almost every day, multiple times a day. The study of meetings is important, but also challenging, as it requires an understanding of social signals and complex interpersonal dynamics. Our aim this work is to use a data-driven approach to the science of meetings. We provide tentative evidence that: i) there are common macro-patterns in the way social dialogue acts are interspersed throughout a meeting, and ii) it is often possible to predict whether a proposal during a meeting will be accepted or rejected based entirely on the language (the set of persuasive words) used by the speaker.

AB  - Persuasion is a common social and economic activity. It usually arises when conflicting interests among agents exist, and one of the agents wishes to sway the opinions of others. This paper considers the problem of an automated agent that needs to influence the decision of a group of self-interested agents that must reach an agreement on a joint action. For example, consider an automated agent that aims to reduce the energy consumption of a nonresidential building, by convincing a group of people who share an office to agree on an economy mode of the air-conditioning and low light intensity. In this paper we present four problems that address issues of minimality and safety of the persuasion process. We discuss the relationships to similar problems from social choice, and show that if the agents are using Plurality or Veto as their voting rule all of our problems are in P. We also show that with K-Approval, Bucklin and Borda voting rules some problems become intractable. We thus present heuristics for efficient persuasion with Borda, and evaluate them through simulations.

AB  - The rise of social media influences in the online journalism domain suggests that new learning systems are required to modify the behaviors of journalists. The design of future systems can be explored as game concepts and guided by an emerging ontology for journalism. For these ends this paper identifies vocabulary, concepts and emotions in the domain, and vital intersections with social media, such as crowdsourcing. Data from participatory workshops with journalists is applied to new synthetic player ideas, using Hoare logic. It is also lightly structured for a starting ontology for journalism, to inform how a synthetic player system might persuade a journalist to check their behaviors. It prompts the core values of journalism, such as obtaining opposing views, and prompts critical engagement with crowdsourcing, before declaring a story newsworthy. The system includes contextual emotions, which may vary from inspiration and curiosity to anxiety, due to not having a story. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Autonomous planning agents that share a common goal should be able to propose, justify and share information about plans. To reach an agreement on the best plan, strategies for persuasion and negotiation could be used by agents in order to share their beliefs about the world and resolve conflicts between the agents. We present an argumentation scheme and associated critical questions to create and justify plan proposals where plans are combinations of actions requiring several agents for their execution. An analysis of different ways in which actions can combine is presented and then associated with the argumentation scheme and the critical questions. We believe these elements are necessary to enable agents to engage in rational debate over co-operative plan proposals. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Player Modelling has been receiving much attention from the game community in the recent years. The ability to build accurate models of player behavior can be useful in many aspects of a game. One important aspect is the tracking of a player's behavior along time, informing every time a change is perceived. This way, the game Artificial Intelligence can adapt itself to better respond to this new behavior. In order to build models of player behavior, researchers frequently resort to Machine Learning techniques. Such methods work on previously recorded game metrics representing player's interactions with the game environment. However, if the player changes styles over time, the constructed models get out of date. In order to address this drawback, this work proposes the use of and incremental learning technique to track a player's behavior during his/her interaction with the game environment. Our approach attempts to automatically detect the moments in time when the player changes behavior. We apply a change detection technique from the area of Data Stream Mining that is based on incremental clustering and novelty detection. We also propose three modifications to the original technique, in order to formalize change detection, improve detection rate and reduce detection delay. Simulations were performed considering data produced by the Unreal Tournament game, showing the applicability of the method to online tracking of a player's behavior and informing whenever behavior changes occur. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to provide a deeper understanding of Shikake through the lens of marketing. "The aim of marketing is to make selling superfluous" is a famous quote by Peter Drucker. Its key message is that marketing is not an effort to control or force consumers to purchase products or services, but an activity to create a situation where consumers engage in consumer behavior spontaneously. The core essence of Shikakeology is a spontaneous behavior change, and it is fair to assume that marketing and Shikakeology share a fundamental philosophy. This paper defines the key concepts in the intersection of marketing and Shikakeology and attempts to classify Shikakes in the field of marketing in accordance with participants' motivation and consciousness. Different types of consumer participation are described in case studies. Finally, attempts are made to reveal the key to success of a Shikake in the field of marketing and discuss future research opportunities. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.

AB  - We begin by discussing legal narratives, and overall narrative plausibility. We consider approaches from the New Evidence scholarship, discuss background generalisations, as well as the impact of modes of communication (the pragmatics of the delivery in court of a legal narrative), and then warn about pitfalls to avoid, in consideration of what controversy within legal scholarship implies about the need for the modelling of legal narratives with artificial intelligence techniques to meet with approval from legal scholars. We then undertake a long overview (in over twenty subsections) of artificial intelligence approaches to narratives. Historically, a legal context for narratives was involved in tools such as BORIS and STARE. Among the other things, we consider the JAMA model, and then conclude the overview with a project from quarters different from those traditionally associated with story-processing in the artificial intelligence research community: namely, Löwe, Pacuit and Saraf’s application of mathematical logic to crime stories. We then explain episodic formulae, and develop an example: the controversy concerning a collection of stuffed birds amid allegations that items were stolen and restuffed. We finally consider Bex’s approach to combining stories and arguments in sense-making software for crime investigation, and then Bex and Bench-Capon’s undertaken project concerning persuasion stories vs. arguments. © 2012, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - We discuss a case study where this technique was used in the design of an ambient intelligence system, highlighting how it impacted the design process both in positive and negative ways. This contextualized account complements related comparative studies that have been conducted outside the context of a design project, and have focused on methodological aspects of video prototyping. We conclude that designers need to be aware of how video as a persuasive medium obfuscates implementation and usability issues, and video prototype production should communicate explicitly the scope of the design issues that it addresses and those it does not. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - This study revisits earlier work, concerning the evolutionary trajectory of agents trained to play iterated prisoner's dilemma on a combinatorial graph. The impact of different connection topologies, used to mediate both the play of prisoner's dilemma and the flow of genes during selection and replacement, is examined. The variety of connection topologies, stored as combinatorial graphs, is revisited and the analysis tools used are substantially improved. A novel tool called the play profile summarizes the distribution of behaviors over multiple replicates of the basic evolutionary algorithm and through multiple evolutionary epochs. The impact of changing the number of states used to encode agents is also examined. Changing the combinatorial graph on which the population resides is found to yield statistically significant differences in the play profiles. Changing the number of states in agents is also found to produce statistically significant differences in behavior. The use of multiple epochs in analysis of agent behavior demonstrates that the distribution of behaviors changes substantially over the course of evolution. The most common pattern is for agents to move toward the cooperative state over time, but this pattern is not universal. Another clear trend is that agents implemented with more states are less cooperative. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - We propose a proof-of-concept machine-learning expert system that learned knowledge of lifestyle and the associated 10-year cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks from individual-level data (i.e., Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, ARIC). The expert system prioritizes lifestyle options and identifies the one that maximally reduce an individual's 10-year CVD risk by (1) using the knowledge learned from the ARIC data and (2) communicating for patient-specific cardiovascular risk information and personal limitations and preferences (as defined by variables used in this study). As a result, the optimal lifestyle is not only prioritized based on an individual's characteristics but is also relevant to personal circumstances.We also explored probable uses and tested the system in several examples using real-world scenarios and patient preferences. For example, the system identifies the most effective lifestyle activities as the starting point for an individual's behavior change, shows different levels of BMI changes and the associated CVD risk reductions to encourage weight loss, identifies whether weight loss or smoking cessation is the most urgent change for a diabetes patient, etc. Answers to the questions noted above vary based on an individual's characteristics. Our validation results from clinical trial simulations, which compared original with the optimal lifestyle using an independent dataset, show that the optimal individualized patient-centered lifestyle consistently reduced 10-year CVD risks. © 2012.

AB  - Since late 90s, systems for monitoring and supporting work in OHL have shown up into global market offering solutions that range from simple temperature measuring devices [1] to more complex systems based on computerized imaging [2, 3]. Aim of these platforms is no other than providing operators with useful information that may ease their work when operating upon certain lines. Data acquired with those systems still needs to be integrated into existing and future architectures in a manner that, instead of flooding with information, eases tasks and decisions to be taken. But, it is worth highlighting, additional needs are to be added into already existing maintenance routines in energy transmission and distribution companies. Maintenance is one of companies' major expenses and integration of OHL monitoring solutions, if not done correctly, will require additional long-term work. Due to envisioned usage for this information and relevance of its integrity regarding line operation, early faulty sensor detection and system behaviour change characterization will be highly relevant in avoiding risky situations. Evolution of energy grids towards more intelligent approaches lead a new vision relaying on information disposition that opens a world of possibilities for data miners and artificial intelligence enthusiasts. Techniques for pre-processing and simplifying acquired in-field data need to evolve, offering reliable and useful solutions that have been successfully applied in adjacent fields [4, 5]. Applied techniques have to ensure security and minimal risk assessment though, discarding or releasing to a second plane techniques recurrently appearing into stateof- the-art literature despite their results in related areas [6, 7] due to uncertainty associated with these methods. Thus, highly reliable and trustworthy solutions need to be found, which is never an easy task. Available information combined with mathematical models may offer notorious advantages on controlling line status and triggering unexpected events, increasing confidence on applied methodologies and easing implantation of these solutions in a near future. With that in mind, aim of this work is, using existing market solutions for overhead line monitoring in combination with community approved mathematical models for dynamic line rating [8]; find solutions which in addition to real time data analysis and predictive line demand estimations, can obtain system's intrinsic parameters based on reverse engineering methodologies and turn those into a source of diagnosis for conductors and metering devices. Therefore, it would make possible early automated countermeasure planning, as well as, conductor detriment tracking, warn operators for conductor replacement or metering device fixing before any malfunctioning is identified; and thus, improve overall functioning by means of simple scheduling. Evaluation of mathematical model adaptability, sensitivity and specificity along with parameter estimation stability encouraged this work that although preliminary shows promising in further development of in-field monitoring solutions for OHL. Main aspects of different explored solutions along these lines take into account computation time, existing software integration feasibility and solution complexity; key aspects for further development and usage of mentioned methodologies. Based on evidence, usage of these parameters in order to observe both conductor behavioural detriments, as well as, malfunctioning of measuring devices, shows plausible although sound evaluation is needed for appropriate event discrimination amongst different possible scenarios. © 2013 CIGRE.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the relationship between gestures and persuasive discourse. It begins with an overview of the history of gesture research and studies about gesture expressivity. It then presents a model of persuasive discourse in terms of goals and beliefs. This model is illustrated by using case studies on the gestural behaviour of famous politicians. Finally, this chapter discusses how such a model can be used to implement persuasive gesturing in an embodied conversational agent. © Oxford University Press, 2008. All rights reserved.

AB  - In our design-research studies, we aim to persuade teenagers to engage in playful moments of casual activity. In this article, we present one explorative prototype: walk-of-fame, a multimedia installation that creates virtual avatars in a corridor, depending on the walking style of passers-by. We intend to create playful active moments throughout the day, independent of time or location, supported by mobile and ambient technologies. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The preparticipation screening for athlete participation in sports typically entails a comprehensive medical and family history and a complete physical examination. A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) can increase the likelihood of detecting cardiac diagnoses such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, but this diagnostic test as part of the screening process has engendered considerable controversy. The pro position is supported by argument that international screening protocols support its use, positive diagnosis has multiple benefits, history and physical examination are inadequate, primary prevention is essential, and the cost effectiveness is justified. Although the aforementioned myriad of justifications for routine ECG screening of young athletes can be persuasive, several valid contentions oppose supporting such a policy, namely, that the sudden death incidence is very (too) low, the ECG screening will be too costly, the false-positive rate is too high, resources will be allocated away from other diseases, and manpower is insufficient for its execution. Clinicians, including pediatric cardiologists, have an understandable proclivity for avoiding this prodigious national endeavor. The controversy, however, should not be focused on whether an inexpensive, noninvasive test such as an ECG should be mandated but should instead be directed at just how these tests for young athletes can be performed in the clinical imbroglio of these disease states (with variable genetic penetrance and phenotypic expression) with concomitant fiscal accountability and logistical expediency in this era of economic restraint. This monumental endeavor in any city or region requires two crucial elements well known to business scholars: implementation and execution. The eventual solution for the screening ECG dilemma requires a truly innovative and systematic approach that will liberate us from inadequate conventional solutions. Artificial intelligence, specifically the process termed "machine learning" and "neural networking," involves complex algorithms that allow computers to improve the decision-making process based on repeated input of empirical data (e.g., databases and ECGs). These elements all can be improved with a national database, evidence-based medicine, and in the near future, innovation that entails a Kurzweilian artificial intelligence infrastructure with machine learning and neural networking that will construct the ultimate clinical decision-making algorithm. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.

AB  - Several systems were developed for supporting public persuasion dialogs where two agents with conflicting opinions try to convince an audience. For computing the outcomes of dialogs, these systems use (abstract or structured) argumentation systems that were initially developed for nonmonotonic reasoning. Despite the increasing number of such systems, there are almost no work on high level properties they should satisfy. This paper is a first attempt for defining postulates that guide the well-definition of dialog systems and that allow their comparison. We propose six basic postulates (including e.g. The finiteness of generated dialogs). We then show that this set of postulates is incompatible with those proposed for argumentation systems devoted for nonmonotonic reasoning. This incompatibility confirms the differences between persuading and reasoning. It also suggests that reasoning systems are not suitable for computing the outcomes of dialogs. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - There are many problems around us need to be solved by human agents. It is very challenging to persuade people to change behavior implicitly, especially for solving public problems. We leverage persuasive mechanism for increasing incentives to change human behavior in a problem solving framework. By linking feedback to the actions, we've been able to increase the incentives to trigger behavior change. We deploy two persuasive feedback system in a building to support energy-saving scenario. By integrating sound feedback to window closing behavior to make people aware of the energy problem in the public space. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.

AB  - We present two empirical studies which examine user mood in long-term interaction with virtual conversational agents. The first study finds evidence for mood as a longitudinal construct independent of momentary affect and demonstrates that mood can be reliably identified by human judges observing user-agent interactions. The second study demonstrates that mood is an important consideration for virtual agents designed to persuade users, by showing that favors are more persuasive than direct requests when users are in negative moods, while direct requests are more persuasive for users in positive moods. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The 2nd International Workshop on Human Behavior Understanding (HBU'11) focuses on inducing behavioral change via computer systems that can analyse human behavior and communicate persuasive messages accordingly. While analysis techniques that involve pattern recognition, signal processing and machine learning are very relevant to this aim, the underlying psychological and sociological aspects of inducing behavioral change cannot be neglected. This paper provides a framework for assessing the impact of social factors for these applications, and discusses the role of social mediation of behaviors and attitudes. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We present an empirical investigation of conversational behavior in dyadic interaction spanning multiple conversations, in the context of a developing interpersonal relationship between a health counselor and her clients. Using a longitudinal video corpus of behavior change counseling conversations, we show systematic changes in verbal and nonverbal behavior during greetings (within the first minute of conversations). Both the number of prior conversations and self reported assessments of the strength of the interpersonal relationship are predictive of changes in verbal and nonverbal behavior. We present a model and implementation of nonverbal behavior generation for conversational agents that incorporates these findings, and discuss how the results can be applied to multimodal recognition of conversational behavior over time.

AB  - Many ethical questions arise when developing persuasive systems. It has become evident that there is no silver bullet which would make it easy to resolve all ethical issues in all cases. This paper seeks to analyze and define potential ways to address ethical considerations in persuasive systems design. We suggest that there are three main approaches: a guideline-based approach, stakeholder analysis, and involving users. This paper helps to understand the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches when developing behavior change support systems, which, by their very nature, request deep engagement and commitment from their users. A pragmatic goal for this paper is to help designers choose an approach for their projects at hand. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Objective: An automated health counselor agent was designed to promote both physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption through a series of simulated conversations with users on their home computers. Methods: The agent was evaluated in a 4-arm randomized trial of a two-month daily contact intervention comparing: (a) physical activity; (b) fruit and vegetable consumption; (c) both interventions; and (d) a non-intervention control. Physical activity was assessed using daily pedometer steps. Daily servings of fruit and vegetables were assessed using the NIH/NCI self-report Fruit and Vegetable Scan. Results: Participants in the physical activity intervention increased their walking on average compared to the control group, while those in the fruit and vegetable intervention and combined intervention decreased walking. Participants in the fruit and vegetable intervention group consumed significantly more servings per day compared to those in the control group, and those in the combined intervention reported consuming more compared to those in the control group. Conclusion: Automated health intervention software designed for efficient re-use is effective at changing health behavior. Practice implications: Automated health behavior change interventions can be designed to facilitate translation and adaptation across multiple behaviors. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: We describe how ehealth communication programs can be improved by using artificial intelligence (AI) to increase immediacy. Methods: We analyzed major deficiencies in ehealth communication programs, illustrating how programs often fail to fully engage audiences and can even have negative consequences by undermining the effective delivery of information intended to guide health decision-making and influence adoption of health-promoting behaviors. We examined the use of AI in ehealth practices to promote immediacy and provided examples from the ChronologyMD project. Results: Strategic use of AI is shown to help enhance immediacy in ehealth programs by making health communication more engaging, relevant, exciting, and actionable. Conclusion: AI can enhance the "immediacy" of ehealth by humanizing health promotion efforts, promoting physical and emotional closeness, increasing authenticity and enthusiasm in health promotion efforts, supporting personal involvement in communication interactions, increasing exposure to relevant messages, reducing demands on healthcare staff, improving program efficiency, and minimizing costs. Practice implications: User-centered AI approaches, such as the use of personally involving verbal and nonverbal cues, natural language translation, virtual coaches, and comfortable human-computer interfaces can promote active information processing and adoption of new ideas. Immediacy can improve information access, trust, sharing, motivation, and behavior changes. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

As millions of stories about health are accumulated daily in blogs and in social networks online there is an opportunity to harvest and index a large database of health stories for interventions. We envision such a database increasing user education, engagement, motivation and rapport in our conversational agent-based health intervention systems. In this paper we propose a model of indexing health stories based on health behavior change theory, enhanced demographies and quality metrics.

AB  - In this paper we offer a proposal to enable agents to discuss the suitability of plans based on an argumentation scheme and associated critical questions. The detail encompassed by the argumentation scheme means that there is a large number of critical questions, and so dialogues may in principle be very lengthy. To improve the efficiency of dialogues we present two strategies for selecting questions. We have implemented the system and here present results showing how both strategies are effective in reducing the number of questions required to reach agreement, although their relative effectiveness is dependent on characteristics of the problem. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper presents a new methodology for designing motivation-augmenting products along with two example cases. Like the tiny habits methodology, trigger piggybacking builds upon the Fogg Behavior Model but unlike the tiny habits methodology it incorporates a Shikakelogical approach to behavior change. Trigger piggybacking claims that a trigger rooted in a value system will produce long-term continuous behavior change. By embodying a relevant value system, the trigger reinforces values and leaves itself open to interpretation. This openness is the key to driving a user's desire to perform a behavior. Trigger piggybacking adds to the toolkit of those that design persuasive technologies. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.

The speech acts in different dialogue types have different pragmatic implications. For a representative sub-type of persuasion dialogues we consider how they can be conducted efficiently, in terms of minimising the expected transfer of information, and develop a strategy for efficient persuasion by exploiting the pragmatic implications. We demonstrate that our strategy is optimal for this sub-type. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Recent work has begun to focus on the use of games as a platform for energy awareness and eco-feedback research. While technical advancements (wireless sensors, fingerprinting) make timely and tailored feedback an objective within easy reach, we argue that taking into account the users' own personal consumption behavior and tailoring feedback accordingly is a key requirement and a harder challenge. We present a first attempt in this direction, EnergyLife, which is designed to support the users' actions and embeds contextualized feedback triggered by specific actions of the user, called 'smart advice'. We conclude by showing the results of a four-month trial with four households that returned promising results on the effectiveness and acceptance of this feature. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Objectives To compare the efficacy of a computer-based physical activity program (Embodied Conversational Agent - ECA) with that of a pedometer control condition in sedentary older adults. Design Single-blind block-randomized controlled trial stratified according to clinic site and health literacy status. Setting Three urban ambulatory care practices at Boston Medical Center between April 2009 and September 2011. Participants Older adults (N = 263; mean age 71.3; 61% female; 63% African American; 51% high school diploma or less). Intervention ECA participants were provided with portable tablet computers with touch screens to use for 2 months and were directed to connect their pedometers to the computer using a data cable and interact with a computer-animated virtual exercise coach daily to discuss walking and to set walking goals. Intervention participants were then given the opportunity to interact with the ECA in a kiosk in their clinic waiting room for the following 10 months. Control participants were given a control pedometer intervention that only tracked step counts for an equivalent period of time. Intervention participants were also provided with pedometers. Measurements The primary outcome was average daily step count for the 30 days before the 12-month interview. Secondary outcomes were average daily step count for the 30 days before the 2-month interview. Outcomes were also stratified according to health literacy level. Results ECA participants walked significantly more steps than control participants at 2 months (adjusted mean 4,041 vs 3,499 steps/day, P =.01), but this effect waned by 12 months (3,861 vs 3,383, P =.09). For participants with adequate health literacy, those in the ECA group walked significantly more than controls at both 2 months (P =.03) and 12 months (P =.02), while those with inadequate health literacy failed to show significant differences between treatment groups at either time point. Intervention participants were highly satisfied with the program. Conclusion An automated exercise promotion system deployed from outpatient clinics increased walking among older adults over the short-term. Effective methods for long-term maintenance of behavior change are needed. © 2013, The American Geriatrics Society.

AB  - This study augments the transtheoretical model (TTM) of behavior change with the concepts of information behavior and employs this framework to understand young men's needs for and practices of obtaining and avoiding information on physical activity and exercise in relation to their readiness to change exercise behavior. The results, based on statistical analyses of a population-based survey (N = 616) conducted in Finland, indicate that health information behavior is influenced by an individual′s stage of change in the context of physical activity and exercise. In pre-action stages (precontemplation, contemplation, preparation) where individuals do not exercise regularly and are uninformed or lack motivation, commitment, or skills to change behaviors, information is most often encountered through the passive practice of nondirected monitoring. In the action stage, where individuals have recently changed their exercise behaviors, information is obtained most frequently by active seeking. In the maintenance stage, where individuals maintain earlier adopted behaviors, information is habitually obtained through active scanning. These results support the TTM in its postulation that individuals may benefit from stage-tailored health-communication strategies. The limitations of this study include self-reported behaviors, cross-sectional study design, and a possibly biased sample. Further research is needed to explore the role of information behavior in the process of behavior change in greater detail. © 2012 ASIS&T.

AB  - Cooperation among vehicles is aimed to create a smooth traffic flow and minimize shockwaves and traffic jams. Before the technology gets mature, cooperative driving may already be made possible by involving the drivers. This paper reports a literature survey on two issues: 1) cooperation in traffic and motivations in driving; 2) persuasive technology and applications of extrinsic feedback. Informed by the literature survey, we propose concepts for supporting driver's behavior change for the purpose of cooperative driving. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - It has become increasingly difficult to ignore the ways that the centrality of new media and technologies – from the global networking of information systems and social media to new possibilities for altering human genetics – seem to make obsolete our traditional ways of thinking about ethics and persuasive communication inherited from earlier humanist paradigms. This book argues that rather than devoting our critical energies towards critiquing humanist touchstones, we should instead examine the ways in which media and technologies have always worked as crucial cultural forces in shaping ethics and rhetoric. Pruchnic combines this historical itinerary with critical interrogations of diverse cultural and technological sites – the logic of video games and artificial intelligence, the ethics of life extension in contemporary medicine, the transition to computer-automated trading in world stock markets, the state of critical theory in the contemporary humanities – along with innovative analyses of the works of such figures as the Greek Sophists, Kenneth Burke, Martin Heidegger, Michel Foucault, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Gilles Deleuze. This book argues that our best strategies for crafting persuasive communication and producing ethical relations between individuals will be those that creatively replicate and appropriate, rather than resist, the logics of dominant forms of media and technology. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - A shikake is a physical and/or psychological trigger for behavior change. In this paper, we present our preliminary consideration on the triggers that best describe shikake specifications. After reviewing previous studies on both physical and psychological triggers for behavior change, we carefully construct shikake trigger categories for systematically describing shikake triggers. On the basis of these categories, we annotate categories for 120 shikake cases. We show the statistics of 19 categories as well as patterns of triggers frequently used together to explore rules of thumb. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.

AB  - A strategy is used by a participant in a persuasion dialogue to select locutions most likely to achieve its objective of persuading its opponent. Such strategies often assume that the participant has a model of its opponents, which may be constructed on the basis of a participant's accumulated dialogue experience. However in most cases the fact that an agent's experience may encode additional information which if appropriately used could increase a strategy's efficiency, is neglected. In this work, we rely on an agent's experience to define a mechanism for augmenting an opponent model with information likely to be dialectally related to information already contained in it. Precise computation of this likelihood is exponential in the volume of related information. We thus describe and evaluate an approximate approach for computing these likelihoods based on Monte-Carlo simulation.

AB  - We discuss our approach to developing a novel modality for the computer-delivery of Brief Motivational Interventions (BMIs) for behavior change in the form of a personalized On-Demand VIrtual Counselor (ODVIC), accessed over the internet. ODVIC is a multimodal Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) that empathically delivers an evidence-based behavior change intervention by adapting, in real-time, its verbal and nonverbal communication messages to those of the user's during their interaction. We currently focus our work on excessive alcohol consumption as a target behavior, and our approach is adaptable to other target behaviors (e.g., overeating, lack of exercise, narcotic drug use, non-adherence to treatment). We based our current approach on a successful existing patient-centered brief motivational intervention for behavior change-the Drinker's Check-Up (DCU)-whose computer-delivery with a text-only interface has been found effective in reducing alcohol consumption in problem drinkers. We discuss the results of users' evaluation of the computer-based DCU intervention delivered with a text-only interface compared to the same intervention delivered with two different ECAs (a neutral one and one with some empathic abilities). Users rate the three systems in terms of acceptance, perceived enjoyment, and intention to use the system, among other dimensions. We conclude with a discussion of how our positive results encourage our long-term goals of on-demand conversations, anytime, anywhere, with virtual agents as personal health and well-being helpers. © 2013 ACM.

AB  - Intelligent animals devote much time and energy to exploring and obtaining information, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. We review recent developments on this topic that have emerged from the traditionally separate fields of machine learning, eye movements in natural behavior, and studies of curiosity in psychology and neuroscience. These studies show that exploration may be guided by a family of mechanisms that range from automatic biases toward novelty or surprise to systematic searches for learning progress and information gain in curiosity-driven behavior. In addition, eye movements reflect visual information searching in multiple conditions and are amenable for cellular-level investigations. This suggests that the oculomotor system is an excellent model system for understanding information-sampling mechanisms. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The development of the initial inventory was successful by means of internal consistency and item-scale correlation for the persuasive strategies rewards, competition, social comparison, trustworthiness and social learning. The inventory can be used to estimate susceptibility to persuasive strategies to personalize persuasive technology according to the users' personality based on self-reports. This can help system designers to make informed design decisions and to adapt persuasive technology. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper attempts to answer what should be taken into consideration to authorize persuasive multimedia contents, especially in the ad domain. Being persuasive is the essential property of ads, as simply delivering information may not be sufficient to persuade those who are exposed to them. On authorizing persuasive multimedia contents, much has been discussed from a technological and technical view point but so far very little has been done from a cognitive view point. What is suggested in this paper for the purpose of authorizing persuasive multimedia contents is the value most desiredproposed under the name of utopic value. Everyone pursues the utopic value in the decision-making process. However, what constitutes this value is not, however, fixed. It varies according to contexts. In this paper, this variation is explained in terms of value shifting. In addition, I attempt to provide an empirical example of value shifting depending on the orientation types of context comparing ads of low-involvementproducts. The conclusion of this paper is that understanding the utopic value and its variationis the key to authorize persuasive multimedia contents.

AB  - Inappropriate speed is a major cause of traffic accidents. Different measures have been considered to control traffic speed, and intelligent speed adaptation (ISA) systems are one of the alternatives. These systems know the speed limits and try to improve compliance with them. This paper deals with an informative ISA system that provides the driver with an advance warning before reaching a road section with singular characteristics that require a lower safe speed than the current speed. In spite of the extensive tests performed using ISA systems, few works show how warnings can be adapted to the driver. This paper describes a method to adapt warning parameters (safe speed on curves, zone of influence of a singular stretch, deceleration process and reaction time) to normal driving behavior. The method is based on a set of tests with and without the ISA system. This adjustment, as well as the analysis of driver acceptance before and after the adaptation and changes in driver behavior (changes in speed and path) resulting from the tested ISA regarding a driver's normal driving style, is shown in this paper. The main conclusion is that acceptance by drivers increased significantly after redefining the warning parameters, but the effect of speed homogenization was not reduced. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To influence health behavior, communication has to be relevant on an individual level and, thus, fulfill the requirement of premissary relevance. This paper attempts to enrich the design of automated health advisors by, first, reviewing main solutions to the challenge of premissary relevance found in the literature and, second, highlighting the value in this field of the theory of argumentation known as pragma-dialectics. Methods: A conceptual paper grounded in persuasion research and argumentation theory. Results: Automated health advisors enable argumentative exchanges with users. But there is a need to design these systems as to make them work in an audience-centered perspective. The theory of pragma-dialectics can be used to analyze the factors that favor or hinder the agreement of users to engage in certain health behaviors, and to identify argumentation strategies targeted to behavior change. Conclusion: Pragma-dialectics can be used to enhance the design of automated health advisors as it operationalizes the dialogical nature of the reasoning process that can influence health behavior. Practice implications: Premissary relevance is a challenge of communication for health promotion at large that can be promisingly addressed through synergies among persuasion research, argumentation theory and Artificial Intelligence. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Unhealthy behaviors increase individual health risks and are a socioeconomic burden. Harnessing social influence is perceived as fundamental for interventions to influence health-related behaviors. However, the mechanisms through which social influence occurs are poorly understood. Online social networks provide the opportunity to understand these mechanisms as they digitally archive communication between members. In this paper, we present a methodology for content-based social network analysis, combining qualitative coding, automated text analysis, and formal network analysis such that network structure is determined by the content of messages exchanged between members. We apply this approach to characterize the communication between members of QuitNet, an online social network for smoking cessation. Results indicate that the method identifies meaningful theme-based social sub-networks. Modeling social network data using this method can provide us with theme-specific insights such as the identities of opinion leaders and sub-community clusters. Implications for design of targeted social interventions are discussed. © 2013 IMIA and IOS Press.

AB  - Since its introduction, geographic information science has witnessed a tremendous growth and can build on enormous achievements (e.g. Cheng et al. 2012). Current geographic information systems and the decision support systems and models that have been accompanying these systems have a strong ‘geography’ identity, typical of the era in which geographic information system were introduced. Systems are mostly based on spatial entities (mostly grids or polygons). To the extent that commercial and open source geographic information systems have been enriched with models, a similar strong geographic flavor can be discerned. Most models of spatial choice behavior are related to the aggregate spatial interaction models, models of land use change are often based on cellular automata. The question then becomes whether dominant spatial decision support systems, fundamentally based on aggregate spatial interaction, cellular automata and similar models, are suitable for adequately predicting consumer response. We content that in light of the increasing complexity of the decision making process and increasing personalization of decisions and lifestyles, these systems and their underlying models have increasingly become inadequate and obsolete. The field should shift to the development of more integral microscopic models of choice behavior, allowing more integral policy performance assessments. Moreover, mobile computing should allow and stimulate the development of real-time information and decision support systems that support the management of urban functions and include persuasive computing. Uncertainty analysis should play an integral role in these developments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - A shikake is an embodied trigger for behavior change to solve social or personal issues. In this paper, we give a general statement regarding the concept of Shikakeol-ogy as the science of shikake. The mechanism behind a shikake covers a wide range of physical and psychological triggers. From a shikake point of view, physical triggers are used to ignite psychological triggers, and psychological triggers work as a driving force for changing behavior. We will describe four simple shikake cases to explain the concept of shikake as well as the mechanisms of triggers. We choose to use case studies to make readers understand the mechanism of shikake as a starting point. We also present the idea of a Shikakeology ecosystem, which is a feedback loop between citizen science, academia, and education. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.

AB  - This paper presents a seven-months field study on a persuasive ambient display in private households. The FORE-Watch aims at adjusting the consumption behavior of energy users in 24 multi-person households and persuading them to change their timing of consumption activities; half of them were shown a forecast of the occupancy rate of the local energy grid (i.e., grid status), and the other half were shown how much energy will be delivered by green sources such as windmills (i.e., green energy). Our qualitative and quantitative survey and the energy consumption data revealed that the grid status group showed a more constant behavior than the green energy, indicating that the more dynamic forecast presentation did not lead to the same type of behavior change as the static forecast presentation. Overall, the FORE-Watch aroused awareness, attention and interest through permanent presence, clear and simple information, and changed the energy consumption behavior of our participants. © 2013 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - The i-Zone initiative proposes a new approach to urban mobility management by using the latest mobile ICT technologies. It is about mobile phones that measure and analyse user behaviour in order to influence travel behaviour. By providing feedback to the traveller (self monitoring), by information sharing, or by providing positive incentives to travellers by road authorities and other stakeholders, improved mobility in a city may be achieved. The information is targeted on individual travel behaviour, and thus allows a personalized approach to influence travel behaviour. This enables a shift from a focus on intelligent transport systems, with the emphasis on infrastructure and car-to-car systems, to a more human-centric approach based on ambient intelligence. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The human-computer dialogue research field has been studying interaction with computers since the early stage of Artificial Intelligence, however, research has often focused on very practical tasks to be completed with the dialogues. A new trend in the field tries to implement persuasive techniques with automated interactive agents; unlike booking a train ticket, for example, such dialogues require the system to show more anthropomorphic qualities. The influences of such qualities in the effectiveness of persuasive dialogue is only starting to be studied. In this article we focus on one important perceived trait of the system: personality, and explore how it influences the persuasiveness of a dialogue system. We introduce a new persuasive dialogue system and combine it with a state of the art personality utterance generator. By doing so, we can control the systems extraversion personality trait and observe its influence on the users perception of the dialogue and its output. In particular, we observe that the users extraversion influences their perception of the dialogue and its persuasiveness, and that the perceived personality of the system can affect its trustworthiness and persuasiveness. We believe that theses observations will help to set up guidelines to tailor dialogue systems to the users interaction expectations and improve the persuasive interventions. © 2012 ACM.

AB  - Shikake provides an interesting way to trigger behavior change in various contexts. However, the way a Shikake triggers behavior is a complex process. We may become interested in a Shikake because it unambiguously supports some of our abilities, it is fun, or just by following other people's behavior when they are interacting with it. Similarly, the outcomes of the interaction can greatly vary from sustainable learning to vanishing curiosity. Nonetheless, each time we interact with a Shikake, we experience the world around us. Consequently, the quality of the mental effort and the quantity of the behavioral effort the Shikake triggers determines our level of engagement in an event. Here we present a psychological design framework that connects Shikake triggers, experience, and behaviors in an engagement space. The contextual focus is on education and learning. An experiential level inspection reveals both conscious and unconscious perceptual pathways, which are especially crucial to understand when learning behaviors are triggered. The framework provides heuristics of what to consider when studying, evaluating, and designing engagement in human-environment interaction processes from a trigger to the resulting experience and behavior. © 2013, Association for the Advancement of artificial intelligence.

AB  - This paper applies recent work on scripts and stories developed as tools of evidential reasoning in artificial intelligence to model the use of argument from analogy as a rhetorical device of persuasion. The example studied is Gerry Spence's closing argument in the case of Silkwood v. Kerr-McGee Corporation, said to be the most persuasive closing argument ever used in an American trial. It is shown using this example how argument from analogy is based on a similarity premise where similarity between two cases is modeled using the device of a story scheme from the hybrid theory of legal evidential reasoning (Bex in Arguments, stories and criminal evidence: a formal hybrid theory. Springer, Dordrecht 2011). It is shown how the rhetorical strategy of Spence's argumentation in the closing argument interweaves argument from analogy with explanation through three levels. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Objective: Computer-based virtual coaches are increasingly being explored for patient education, counseling, and health behavior training and coaching. The objective of this research was to develop and evaluate a Virtual Mindfulness Coach for training and coaching in mindfulness meditation. Methods: The coach was implemented as an embodied conversational character, providing mindfulness training and coaching via mixed initiative, text-based, natural language dialog with the student, and emphasizing affect-adaptive interaction. (The term 'mixed initiative dialog' refers to a human-machine dialog where either can initiate a conversation or a change in the conversation topic.). Results: Findings from a pilot evaluation study indicate that the coach-based training is more effective in helping students establish a regular practice than self-administered training using written and audio materials. The coached group also appeared to be in more advanced stages of change in terms of the transtheoretical model, and have a higher sense of self-efficacy regarding establishment of a regular mindfulness practice. Conclusion: These results suggest that virtual coach-based training of mindfulness is both feasible, and potentially more effective, than a self-administered program. Of particular interest is the identification of the specific coach features that contribute to its effectiveness. Practice implications: Virtual coaches could provide easily accessible and cost-effective customized training for a range of health behaviors. The affect-adaptive aspect of these coaches is particularly relevant for helping patients establish long-term behavior changes. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Steering behaviours can be used to position 3D embodied agents in small groups engaged in relatively simple social interactions such as in group conversation or walking while talking. Less is known about scaling these mechanisms for situations with complex dynamics requiring agents to perform actions beyond walking, turning, talking and gesturing. Here, we present a model for controlling three agents in an example of such a situation: a vigorous quarrel. The model combines a general steering behaviour for keeping the three agents in a triangular formation with a probabilistic two-level hierarchical state machine (hFSM) for unfolding the quarrel by means of changing parameters of the steering behaviour and issuing actions to the agents. The model has been implemented using UnrealEngine2Runtime on the example of a boy dating two girls at the same time who do not know about each other. The user can influence the course of the quarrel by changing attitudes among the agents. To create a list of the agents' actions and the hFSM, we video-taped about 40 episodes in which three actors improvised on the topic of the quarrel, and we manually annotated the videos. The evaluation with 67 human participants indicates that the model produces outcomes comprehensible and believable even for persons with limited previous experience with 3D graphics. On a more general level, this paper suggests that augmenting steering behaviours by a non-trivial higher-level controller is a feasible approach to modelling behaviour of 3D agents interacting in small groups in a complex way and presents a possible workflow for developing scenes featuring such agents. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Philosophers have become increasingly interested in testimony (e.g. Coady, Testimony: A philosophical study. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992; Kusch & Lipton, Stud Hist Philos Sci 33:209–217). In the context of argumentation and persuasion, the distinction between the content of a message and its source is a natural and important one. The distinction has consequently attracted considerable attention within psychological research. There has also been a range of normative attempts to deal with the question of how source and message characteristics should combine to give rise to an overall evaluation of evidential strength (e.g. Walton, Witness testimony evidence: Argumentation, artificial intelligence, and law. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008). This chapter treats this issue from the perspective of the Bayesian approach to argument (Hahn & Oaksford, Psychol Rev 114:704–732, 2007a; Hahn et al., Informal Log 29:337–367, 2009) and summarises empirical evidence on key intuitions. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.

AB  - During the workshop on Ambient Gaming (AmGam'11) at the International Conference on Ambient Intelligence in Amsterdam, 16-18 November 2011, 17 participants from 8 different countries discussed emerging research topics around Ambient Gaming. With ambient games and play we denote playful activities that are seamlessly integrated within our daily lives in such a way that the boundaries between other activities and play disappear or blur. Ambient games blend the virtual and real world and are interacted with through multiple ubiquitous devices. Ambient games and play have a strong motivational character and may offer more natural and improved interaction. However, we are also faced with many challenges, not only technological, but societal and ethical as well. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Many complex water problems of 2050 will not be solved using the decision processes of 2010. More creative decision-making will be helpful. The changes needed for more creative problem solving are discussed. Advancements in computer technology, especially algorithms based on the neurological processes of discovery, will be required. The algorithms in the form of artificial intelligence will incorporate emotional thinking with cognitive processes. Success in advancing creative thinking will also require attitude changes and broader thinking skills such as those emphasized in the ASCE Body of Knowledge. © 2012 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Personalization being a major change in contemporary democratic persuasive endeavor, the paper is based on the general idea that leaders may sound more persuasive by using self-disclosure communications. The study presented is a first tentative to explore how Obama might profit from his references to his own life story to enhance intergroup reconciliation processes, when speaking officially to leaders of other countries. The in-depth multimodal analyses of the opening parts of two important political speeches (in Accra on July 11 2009, and in Jakarta on November 10 2010) allow to detect Obama's different uses of autobiographical memories, sometimes linked to personal aspects and some other times more focused on social and historical aspects, without conveying any self-exposure intent. Consequences for further studies as well as for the need of a more complex concept of personalization are discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2013.

AB  - We discuss the design and implementation of the prototype of an avatar-based health system aimed at providing people access to an effective behavior change intervention which can help them to find and cultivate motivation to change unhealthy lifestyles. An empathic Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) delivers the intervention. The health dialog is directed by a computational model of Motivational Interviewing, a novel effective face-to-face patient-centered counseling style which respects an individual's pace toward behavior change. Although conducted on a small sample size, results of a preliminary user study to asses users' acceptance of the avatar counselor indicate that the system prototype is well accepted by 75% of users.

AB  - Levels of overweight and obese individuals have been seen as rising across the globe. This has caused concerns with regard to how active individuals are and realization that a high percentage of the population do not meet the weekly requirement of physical activity. Current focus has been on the capabilities that new technologies can offer as an intervention technique. This paper offers an initial investigation into one such technology, namely the iPod Nike+ kit, which acts as a tracker for running behaviors. This scoping study was conducted via a questionnaire and analysis of customer reviews. Participants were assessed on their stage of change for physical activity behavior, based on the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM), before and after using the technology. The results from this study showed that the technology was received positively from those who used it and the predominant outcome was that individuals were more enthusiastic about running. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The paper presents the results of the experiment on the projective meaning of nur (German: only). The data from German shows that the prejacent of nur projects easily out of counterfactual if-clauses, whereas its projective behaviour changes when it is embedded in indicative if-clauses. The obtained results classify projection out of counterfactuals as a reliable test for projective meanings in the cross-linguistic perspective, on the one hand, while shedding more light on the semantics of nur and conditionals, on the other. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - While work in interaction design, human-computer interaction (HCI) and the games literature begins to address experience beyond positive, it just scratches the surface. By turning to drama, literature, music, art and film that has shaped experiences and emotion beyond the positive and fun for many years, we describe what experience beyond positive looks like, show how it is not always "uncomfortable" and argue for the more appropriate term "serious experience". We discuss the importance of the take-away message / serious experience in persuasive technology, persuasive games and serious games to linger or resonate post-encounter for user/players to encourage reflection, affect attitudes and change behaviors in order to fulfill a persuasive purpose. Finally, we describe associated ethical concerns and make recommendations for designers, evaluators and practitioners in order to safeguard players/users. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Ambient Intelligence technologies call for new space concepts building on an understanding of how humans interrelate with objects. This paper argues for an environmental perspective on the analysis of persuasive technologies. It assumes that dualistic thinking, which recurs to categories such as society/ technology or subject/object, has to be questioned. This paper resumes the approach of the PhD project 'Thinking Space' on the spatial dimensions of intelligent technologies. Space concepts from physics, sociology and literature theory form the basis for an empirically informed philosophical approach. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.

AB  - This paper reports about pervasive interventions at a university campus to increase the pro-environmental awareness, consciousness, and learning of employees. Based on an assessment of the research gaps in this problem area we present results and design implications from three intervention iterations. While in the first intervention the focus was on increasing awareness through information distribution with ambient learning displays on the campus, the second iteration provided personalised feedback to employees with the help of a sensor network and different client applications. The third iteration then implemented a game-based learning concept. Results reveal that these approaches are effective on different levels and that a combination of these elements can lead to increased pro-environmental consciousness, learning and hopefully a sustained behaviour change of employees. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Narrative, a distinctly cognitive phenomenon, has long been of interest to the disciplines that comprise cognitive science. The past decade has seen a resurgence of work using computational methods to understand, manipulate, generate, and leverage narratives. This symposium, which is held in association with the Fourth International Workshop on Computational Models of Narrative (CMN'13), a satellite event of CogSci 2013, will focus on aspects of the scientific and computational understanding of narrative that intersect with cognitive science. The speakers and moderators are drawn from diverse fields including cognitive psychology, artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computational linguistics, and the humanities, and they will focus on a variety of topics including: narrative and its role in analogy, education, and persuasion; challenges in the representation of syntax, discourse, and semantics of narrative; psychological and neuropsychological aspects of narrative; and the growing integration of computational models of narrative in humanities research. © CogSci 2013.All rights reserved.

AB  - Philosophers have become increasingly interested in testimony (e.g. Coady, Testimony: A philosophical study. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 1992; Kusch & Lipton, Stud Hist Philos Sci 33:209–217). In the context of argumentation and persuasion, the distinction between the content of a message and its source is a natural and important one. The distinction has consequently attracted considerable attention within psychological research. There has also been a range of normative attempts to deal with the question of how source and message characteristics should combine to give rise to an overall evaluation of evidential strength (e.g. Walton, Witness testimony evidence: Argumentation, artificial intelligence, and law. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2008). This chapter treats this issue from the perspective of the Bayesian approach to argument (Hahn & Oaksford, Psychol Rev 114:704–732, 2007a; Hahn et al., Informal Log 29:337–367, 2009) and summarises empirical evidence on key intuitions. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - As theWeb has become integrated into daily life, understanding how individuals spend their time online impacts domains ranging from public policy to marketing. It is difficult, however, to measure even simple aspects of browsing behavior via conventional methods-including surveys and site-level analytics-due to limitations of scale and scope. In part addressing these limitations, large-scale Web panel data are a relatively novel means for investigating patterns of Internet usage. In one of the largest studies of browsing behavior to date, we pair Web histories for 250,000 anonymized individuals with user-level demographics-including age, sex, race, education, and income-to investigate three topics. First, we examine how behavior changes as individuals spend more time online, showing that the heaviest users devote nearly twice as much of their time to social media relative to typical individuals. Second, we revisit the digital divide, finding that the frequency with which individuals turn to theWeb for research, news, and healthcare is strongly related to educational background, but not as closely tied to gender andethnicity. Finally, we demonstrate that browsing histories are a strong signal for inferring user attributes, including ethnicity and household income, a result that may be leveraged to improve ad targeting.

The scientific contributions focused on techniques and algorithmic aspects of human behavior analysis, including visual and audio modalities, as well as the design aspect of persuasive systems. One important conclusion of the workshop is that while persuasive systems and carefully designed persuasive messages form the crux of inducing behavior change, the design of systems informed by large-scale analysis of human behavior can also lead to engineered contexts for affecting behavior, at different resolutions ranging from an individual level (e.g. mobile platforms or smart homes) to urban level (e.g. carefully planned cities). © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

The AGn logic was introduced to express beliefs and persuasive actions of agents, and then it was used to perform model checking in persuasive inter-agent communication. In this paper, we enrich AGn by adapting strategy operators from Alternating-time Temporal Logic and adding new ones to allow reasoning about the success and persuasive power of dialogues. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Rational and Objectives: Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems are intended to improve performance. This study investigates how CAD might actually interfere with a visual search task. This is a laboratory study with implications for clinical use of CAD. Methods: Forty-seven naive observers in two studies were asked to search for a target, embedded in 1/f2.4 noise while we monitored their eye movements. For some observers, a CAD system marked 75% of targets and 10% of distractors, whereas other observers completed the study without CAD. In experiment 1, the CAD system's primary function was to tell observers where the target might be. In experiment 2, CAD provided information about target identity. Results: In experiment 1, there was a significant enhancement of observer sensitivity in the presence of CAD (t(22) = 4.74, P < .001), but there was also a substantial cost. Targets that were not marked by the CAD system were missed more frequently than equivalent targets in no-CAD blocks of the experiment (t(22) = 7.02, P < .001). Experiment 2 showed no behavioral benefit from CAD, but also no significant cost on sensitivity to unmarked targets (t(22) = 0.6, P = NS). Finally, in both experiments, CAD produced reliable changes in eye movements: CAD observers examined a lower total percentage of the search area than the no-CAD observers (experiment 1: t(48) = 3.05, P < .005; experiment 2: t(50) = 7.31, P < .001). Conclusions: CAD signals do not combine with observers' unaided performance in a straightforward manner. CAD can engender a sense of certainty that can lead to incomplete search and elevated chances of missing unmarked stimuli. © 2012 AUR.

AB  - Affective computing is a very hot and innovative topic in Artificial intelligence, it is computing that relates to, arises from, or deliberately influences emotion and other affective phenomena, which is firstly proposed by Professor Picard at MIT in 1997. Research on Affective Computing contributes to Artificial Intelligence, Pattern Recognition, Machine Learning, Human-Computer Interaction, Social Robotics, Autonomous Agents, Affective Neuroscience, Neuro economics, Health-behavior Change, and many other areas where technology is used to detect, recognize measure, communicate, elicit, handle, or otherwise understand and influence emotion. Aiming at emotion deficiency in present E-Learning system, a lot of negative effects were analyzed and corresponding countermeasures were proposed. Basing on it, we combined affective computing with the traditional E-Learning system. The model of E-Learning system based on affective computing was constructed by using audiovisual emotion, which took both facial and audio features as input data. Our simulation experiment results showed that rough set theory was effective in emotion recognition, and a high recognition rate is resulted. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - What happens when a Virtual Human makes a mistake? In this study we investigate the impact of a VH's conversational mistakes in the context of persuasion. Users interacted with a VH that told persuasive information, and they were given the option to use the information to complete a problem-solving task. The VH occasionally made mistakes such as not responding, repeating the same answer, or giving an irrelevant reply. Results indicated that a VH who makes conversational mistakes is capable of social influence. Individual differences also shed light on the cognitive processes of users who interacted with error-prone VHs. We discuss the implications of these results with regard to VH design. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In recent years, several bilateral protocols regulating the exchange of arguments between agents have been proposed. When dealing with persuasion, the objective is to arbitrate among conflicting viewpoints. Often, these debates are not entirely predetermined from the initial situation, which means that agents have a chance to influence the outcome in a way that fits their individual preferences. This paper introduces a simple and intuitive protocol for multiparty argumentation, in which several (more than two) agents are equipped with argumentation systems. We further assume that they focus on a (unique) argument (or issue) - thus making the debate two-sided - but do not coordinate. We study what outcomes can (or will) be reached if agents follow this protocol. We investigate in particular under which conditions the debate is pre-determined or not, and whether the outcome coincides with the result obtained by merging the argumentation systems. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper describes the design of a multimodal spoken dialogue system using Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) to enable embodied conversational virtual health coach agents to deliver brief interventions for lifestyle behavior change - in particular excessive alcohol consumption. Its contribution is two fold. First, it is the first attempt to-date to study stochastic dialogue policy optimization techniques in the health dialogue domain. Second, it provides a model for longer branching dialogues (in terms of number of dialogue turns and number of slots) than the usual slot filling dialogue interactions currently available (e.g. tourist information domain). In addition, the model forms the basis for the generation of a richly annotated dialogue corpus, which is essential for applying optimization methods based on reinforcement learning. © 2013 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The Theory of Planned Behaviour model (Ajzen, 1985) was used to determine whether long-term experience with Intelligent Speed Adaption (ISA) prompts a change in speed related cognitions. The study examines data collected as part of a project examining driver behaviour with an intervening but overridable ISA system. Data was collected in four six-month field trials. The trials followed an A-B-A design (28 days driving with no ISA, 112 days driving with ISA, 28 days driving without ISA) to monitor changes in speeding behaviour as a result of the ISA system and any carry-over effect of the system. Findings suggested that following experience with the system, drivers' intention to speed significantly weakened, beyond the removal of ISA support. Drivers were also less likely to believe that exceeding the speed would 'get them to their destination more quickly' and less likely to believe that 'being in a hurry' would facilitate speeding. However, the positive change in intentions and beliefs failed to translate into behaviour. Experience with the ISA system significantly reduced the percentage of distance travelled whilst exceeding the speed limit but this effect was not evident when the ISA support was removed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this paper, we have proposed a user model for computer based drinking behavior change intervention and recommender systems. We discuss specific requirements of user modeling in health promotion and specifically alcohol interventions. We believe that making behavior change systems available pervasively may lead to better and sustainable results. Therefore, our proposed user model takes advantage of the target-behavior related features such as contextual features (e.g., social interactions, location, and time). The proposed user model uses well-validated questionnaires to capture target-behavior specific aspects. We also introduced approaches for enhancing users' experience in the model creation stage by using Embodied Conversational Agents(ECAs) and users' affective states.

AB  - Extended periods of time sitting in front of a computer give rise to risks of developing musculoskeletal disorders. In the workplace, computer use contributes considerably to employee injury and results in significant costs to the employer in terms of sick leave and injury claims. Due to these risks there has been significant research into the areas of posture classification and subject intervention to improve posture in an office environment. The Kinect™ has been shown to be a suitable hardware platform for posture classification. This paper presents a system for posture classification and novel subject intervention that leverages each of three distinct forms of persuasive computing and explores the success of each type. Our results show significant improvement in posture results from the most effective of our intervention types. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2013.

AB  - In this paper we present a comparative study of performance of an adaptive e-banking Web application supporting personalization either on a client or on a server side. Currently, modern applications being developed support various kinds of personalization. One of its types is changing behavior and appearance in response to actions taken by a user. Not only pre-defined rules but also new patterns discovered for different levels of events should be applied. Scaling such "interactive" applications to a large number of users is challenging. First, the stream of events generated by users' actions may be huge, and second, processing of the adaptation rules per single user requires computing resources that multiply with the number of users. This paper reports on the efficiency of the method enabling a client-side adaptation after moving adaptation logics from a server to a client. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Persuasion is an attempt of changing individual's behaviors and attitudes. Computer systems which incorporate with an embodied agent can be effective persuasive user interface as a social actor; and we developed and evaluated the persuasive application software which was named "iDetective" as the previous work. The main persuasive strategy of the iDetective was conversations including questions between users and an agent. However, as the result of the user study, those who answered to the question just by curiosity can be decrease the precision of the persuasion. In this research, we focused on the existence of other individuals based on theories related to relationship with other individuals by disclosing answers of one individual to others. Also, we evaluated our method by developing and using a web-based application where a user can have conversation with an agent. As a result, although boredom due to the scarcity of the conversation has more affected than the observation by other members, such disclosure was accepted by most of participants in the settings of this research and we found grounds of further study using the existence of others as a design strategy in the aspect of persuading individuals to provide their real opinion or situation. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The main goal of smart home applications can be summarized as improving (or keeping) users' comfort maximizing energy savings. Holistic management and awareness about users' habits play fundamental roles in this achievement, as they add predictive, adaptive and conflict resolution capabilities to the home automation system. The present paper presents an application for the thermal comfort that utilizes information from habit profiles - occupancy, comfort temperature and comfort relative humidity - and is designed to be integrated within overall smart home approaches. The application pursues to keep outdoor air quality and thermal comfort controlling shading devices and ventilation elements in unoccupied times and exploiting unobtrusively persuasive technologies in occupied periods. This context aware pre-control phase paves the way to minimize heating and cooling costs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: Information technology can help individuals to change their health behaviors. This is due to its potential for dynamic and unbiased information processing enabling users to monitor their own progress and be informed about risks and opportunities specific to evolving contexts and motivations. However, in many behavior change interventions, information technology is underused by treating it as a passive medium focused on efficient transmission of information and a positive user experience. Objective: To conduct an interdisciplinary literature review to determine the extent to which the active technological capabilities of dynamic and adaptive information processing are being applied in behavior change interventions and to identify their role in these interventions. Methods: We defined key categories of active technology such as semantic information processing, pattern recognition, and adaptation. We conducted the literature search using keywords derived from the categories and included studies that indicated a significant role for an active technology in health-related behavior change. In the data extraction, we looked specifically for the following technology roles: (1) dynamic adaptive tailoring of messages depending on context, (2) interactive education, (3) support for client self-monitoring of behavior change progress, and (4) novel ways in which interventions are grounded in behavior change theories using active technology. Results: The search returned 228 potentially relevant articles, of which 41 satisfied the inclusion criteria. We found that significant research was focused on dialog systems, embodied conversational agents, and activity recognition. The most covered health topic was physical activity. The majority of the studies were early-stage research. Only 6 were randomized controlled trials, of which 4 were positive for behavior change and 5 were positive for acceptability. Empathy and relational behavior were significant research themes in dialog systems for behavior change, with many pilot studies showing a preference for those features. We found few studies that focused on interactive education (3 studies) and self-monitoring (2 studies). Some recent research is emerging in dynamic tailoring (15 studies) and theoretically grounded ontologies for automated semantic processing (4 studies). Conclusions: The potential capabilities and risks of active assistance technologies are not being fully explored in most current behavior change research. Designers of health behavior interventions need to consider the relevant informatics methods and algorithms more fully. There is also a need to analyze the possibilities that can result from interaction between different technology components. This requires deep interdisciplinary collaboration, for example, between health psychology, computer science, health informatics, cognitive science, and educational methodology. © Catriona M Kennedy, John Powell, Thomas H Payne, John Ainsworth, Alan Boyd, Iain Buchan.

AB  - Inquiry, Persuasion and Deliberation Dialogues are all designed to transfer information between agents so that their beliefs and opinions may be revised in the light of the new information, and all make use of a similar set of speech acts. These dialogues also have significant differences. We define success conditions for some different dialogue types in this family and note the pragmatic implications of the speech acts they employ. Focusing on persuasion we consider how successful persuasion dialogues can be conducted efficiently, in terms of minimising the expected transfer of information. We observe that a strategy for efficient persuasion can be developed by considering the pragmatic implications. We present results showing that our strategy is an optimal strategy in a range of representative persuasion scenarios.

AB  - The ability to acquire, remember and use information about locations of objects in one's proximal surrounding is a fundamental aspect of human spatial cognition. In this paper, we present a computational model of this ability. The model provides a possible explanation of contradictory results from experimental psychology related to this ability, namely explanation of why some experiments have reproduced the so-called " disorientation effect" while others have failed to do so. Additionally, in contrast to other computational models of various aspects of spatial cognition, our model is integrated within an intelligent virtual agent. Thus, on a more general level, this paper also demonstrates that it is possible to use intelligent virtual agents as a powerful research tool in computational cognitive sciences. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Herein, we put forth a new similarity measure for anomaly detection and for comparing human behaviors based on the theories of learning automata, comparison of soft partitions, and temporal probabilistic order relations. In particular, focus is placed on monitoring individuals in a home setting for their own well-being. This work is a high-level investigation focused on the structure of human behavior. Examples demonstrate the utility of this approach for (1) understanding the similarity of pairs of behaviors for an individual (or alternatively between individuals) and (2) detecting significant change between changing behavior and a baseline model. In the context of eldercare, significant change in behavior can be a precursor to cognitive and/or functional health related problems. Simulated resident behavior is used to show different scenarios and the response of the proposed measure. Copyright © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This workshop will discuss the psychological and interaction mechanisms, potential applications and ethical dilemmas of ubiquitous persuasive technology. That is, persuasive technologies are intentionally designed to change a person's attitude or behavior or both, and aim at persuading human agents to behave in socially-valued ways, by giving information, providing feedback, and taking over actions (e.g., a fuel consumption feedback device in a car). More and more, ubiquitous technology surrounds the users in their everyday life, which allows for persuasive interventions at the right time and in the right place, without the necessity of the (full) attention of the user. This workshop will study ubiquitous persuasive technology and its strong potential to change behavior or attitudes from an interdisciplinary perspective. It will address the need for theoretical foundations (e.g., psychological, interactional), investigate potential applications and consider ethical consequences of ubiquitous persuasive technology. © ICT&S Center, University of Salzburg.

AB  - Online human interactions take place within a dynamic hierarchy, where social influence is determined by qualities such as status, eloquence, trustworthiness, authority and persuasiveness. In this work, we consider topic-based Twitter interaction networks, and address the task of identifying influential players. Our motivation is the strong desire of many commerical entities to increase their social media presence by engaging positively with pivotal bloggers and Tweeters. After discussing some of the issues involved in extracting useful interaction data from a Twitter feed, we define the concept of an active node subnetwork sequence. This provides a time-dependent, topic-based, summary of relevant Twitter activity. For these types of transient interactions, it has been argued that the flow of information, and hence the influence of a node, is highly dependent on the timing of the links. Some nodes with relatively small bandwidth may turn out to be key players because of their prescience and their ability to instigate follow-on network activity. To simulate a commercial application, we build an active node subnetwork sequence based on key words in the area of travel and holidays. We then compare a range of network centrality measures, including a recently proposed version that accounts for the arrow of time, with respect to their ability to rank important nodes in this dynamic setting. The centrality rankings use only connectivity information (who Tweeted whom, when), but if we post-process the results by examining account details, we find that the time-respecting, dynamic, approach, which looks at the follow-on flow of information, is less likely to be ‘misled’ by accounts that appear to generate large numbers of automatic Tweets with the aim of pushing out web links. We then benchmark these algorithmically derived rankings against independent feedback from five social media experts who judge Twitter accounts as part of their professional duties. We find that the dynamic centrality measures add value to the expert view, and indeed can be hard to distinguish from an expert in terms of who they place in the top ten. We also highlight areas where the algorithmic approach can be refined and improved. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2012.

AB  - Health websites are an abundant and frequently used source of information and advice. How are users of such sites persuaded to trust the advice they read and to act upon it? In this short paper we outline a model of trust in online health advice and highlight the key features in relation to both traditional web 1.0 websites and web 2.0 health sites. Findings from two recent studies are reviewed to provide examples of the ways in which persuasive technology is influencing health behaviour in complex and subtle ways.

AB  - Decades of research have explored factors that can influence green behavior. However, much less is known about how technology in general, and social technologies in particular can motivate people to participate in green activities. In this paper we describe the goals, design and evaluation of StepGreen.org, a site intended to promote energy-saving behaviors. We present the results of a field study, during which participants chose to engage in different actions and reported when they had completed them. Our results suggest that motivating factors like public commitment and competition are effective, and better leveraging these factors will likely lead to even greater appeal and effectiveness. Our contribution is to create an understanding of the impact of different decisions on the success of StepGreen.org that can benefit the designers of other multifaceted, online systems for behavior change.

AB  - Many essential components of language charted by rhetoric, the ancient study of persuasion, remain understudied and underrepresented in current Natural Language systems. Our goal is to combine linguistic and rhetorical theories with discourse analysis and machine learning to develop formal models of computational rhetoric that may be usefully applied in real-world Computational Linguistics systems. As part of this initiative, we are building an ontology of rhetorical figures and formalizing their expression.

AB  - Value-based argumentation frameworks, as introduced by Bench-Capon, allow the abstract representation of persuasive argumentation. This formalism takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ordering which represents an audience. Deciding subjective or objective acceptance (i.e., acceptance with respect to at least one or with respect to all orderings) are intractable computational problems. In this paper we study the computational complexity of testing the subjective or objective acceptance for problem instances that obey certain restrictions. We consider structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graph structure of the value-based argumentation framework and in terms of properties of the equivalence relation formed by arguments with the same relative strength. We identify new tractable fragments where subjective and objective acceptance can be tested in polynomial time. Furthermore we show the intractability of some fragments that are located at the boundary to tractability. Our results disprove two conjectures of Dunne (Artificial Intelligence 171, 2007). © 2010 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper is a first attempt to define a protocol able to handle enthymemes in a persuasion dialog. An enthymeme is an incomplete argument that uses implicit information either in the support of the argument or even in its conclusion. We propose a protocol that enables the agent to enunciate statements or to utter maybe incomplete arguments, retract or re-precise them. This protocol is designed to forbid inconsistency and redundancy and to ensure that agents listen to each other. The system is illustrated on a small example and some of its properties are presented. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - A café table is a traditional setting for conversation. Tabletop displays may have an active role in this connection. In particular for a museum scenario, conversation after the visit is important for a joint elaboration of a small group visit experience. We propose the museum café as the location to introduce a tabletop display meant to foster and support conversation about the visit. The goal of the system is to influence the development of the conversation by adopting persuasion techniques. We describe a system that monitors the conversation among the visitors and dynamically shows visual stimuli on the table surface. An initial formative evaluation is conducted through a series of qualitative user studies.

AB  - Besides saving energy, using it at the right time (i.e. when there is a supply surplus, and the power is produced by sustainable power sources such as hydroelectricity or wind) is an important possibility to achieve positive effects for the environment. To enable the user to align their behavior with the dynamics of the energy generation they need to be informed about the current status of power supply and grid capacity. Furthermore, to be able to plan their behavior and possibly delay or advance consumption activities to more proper moments they also need to have access to high-quality forecasts about the future status of green energy supply. In this paper we present an ambient display design solution based on a common watch that is optimized for providing this information in an unobtrusive, ambient and persuasive way. We present and discuss requirements identified by use of literature analysis, focus groups and end-user questionnaires, outline approaches to calculate basic power generation forecasts based on weather forecast data and present an ambient interface concept designed to meet the identified requirements. We conclude that the developed approach has high potential to support desired behavior changes, and that achieving acceptable accuracy levels for the generation forecast is feasible with relatively little effort. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Accurate traffic parameters such as traffic flow, travel speeds and occupancies, are crucial to effective management of intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Some traffic data from loop detectors settled in arterial streets are incomplete, and the importance of effectively imputing the missing values emerges. In this paper, a technique called least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) is introduced to predict missing traffic flow based on spatio-temporal analysis in urban arterial streets. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to apply the rising computational intelligence (CI) technique incorporating with state space approach in missing traffic data imputation. Having good generalization ability and guaranteeing global minima ensure its well performance in the area. A baseline imputation technique, expectation maximization/data augmentation (EM/DA), is selected for comparison because of its proved effectiveness in missing data recovery. Through persuasive comparisons of the techniques, the proposed model is proved to be more applicable and performs better in stability and adaptability, which reveals that it is a promising approach in missing data prediction. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - In the field of natural argumentation and computer persuasion, there has not been any clear definition of the persuasiveness of a system trying to influence the user. In this paper, we describe a general evaluation task that can be instantiated on a number of domains to evaluate the beliefs change of participants. Through the use of a ranking task, we can measure the participant's change of beliefs related to a behaviour or an attitude. This general metric allows a better comparison of state of the art persuasive systems.

AB  - This paper reports on some prelimary research into how software tools like InterLoc can be used as an interface to the World Wide Argument Web (WWAW) and how the WWAW in return can provide a useful resource to agents acting within InterLoc. Two persuasive dialogue games, the human-oriented Critical Reasoning Game (CRG) from InterLoc and the philosophy-based agent-oriented game for permissive persuasion named PPD 0 are compared using the Dialogue Game Description Language (DGDL) as an interlingua. The expressiveness of each game is investigated by mapping output dialogues onto argumentation structures represented in the Argument Interchange Format (AIF).

AB  - The term “techno science” is increasingly being used to refer to such contemporary disciplines as information and communication technology, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence and to biotechnology. The popularity of the term is illustrated by the fact that even a group of social scientists reporting on the changing attitudes of European public towards biotechnology invokes the term to mark the departure of this particular field from the norms and values once held to be essential to the ethos of science. The evident commercialization and industrialization of biotechnology, with the pursuit of private knowledge, patents and profits, hardly meets Merton's criteria of universalism, communism, disinterestedness and skepticism, or the public's expectations about the values, accountability and social responsibility of science. Biotechnology has become a techno science, a commercial enterprise accountable to financial markets and to shareholders. It is interesting to note that the public, according to these social scientists, have not yet fully accommodated to the new commercial realities of “techno science” and still entertain expectations about science that modern biotechnology is unlikely going to meet. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A variety of social networks feature a directed attention or “follower” network. In this paper, we compare several methods of recommending new people for users to follow. We analyzed structural patterns in a directed social network to evaluate the likelihood that they will predict a future connection, and use these observations to inform an intervention experiment where we offer users of this network new people to connect to. This paper compares a variety of features for recommending users and presents design implications for social networking services. Certain types of structural closures significantly outperform recommendations based on traditional collaborative filtering, behavioral, and similarity features. We find that sharing an audience with someone is a surprisingly compelling reason to follow them, and that similarity is much less persuasive. We also find evidence that organic network growth is very different from how users behave when they are prompted to connect to new people.

AB  - A map of the current landscape of sustainable HCI that differentiates and organizes the approaches that have emerged in the field and describes emerging topics of dissension are discussed. A dominant genre in sustainable HCI is persuasive technology: systems that attempt to convince users to behave in a more sustainable way. The forms of these systems range from devices and physical artifacts to visualizations to instrumented environments and intelligent agents. Sustainable interaction design (SID) uses sustainability as a lens to rethink the role and outcomes of design. Differences arise around how to approach users and their lifestyles. There is even a noticeable lack of connection between sustainable HCI and other technical fields. These issues prompt questions of what the boundaries of sustainable HCI are or should be. There is a clear need for sustainable HCI to draw on the expertise of researchers in areas such as hardware, environmental information systems, and community information systems, and there is also a clear need for HCI expertise in those areas.

AB  - Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) are poised to constitute a specific category within persuasive systems, in particular through their ability to support affective dialogue. One possible approach consists in using ECA as virtual coaches or personal assistants and to make persuasion part of a dialogue game implementing specific argumentation or negotiation features. In this paper, we explore an alternative framework, which emerges from the long-term development of ECA as "Companions" supporting free conversation with the user, rather than task-oriented dialogue. Our system aims at influencing user attitudes as part of free conversation, albeit on a limited set of topics. We describe the implementation of a Companion ECA to which the user reports on his working day, and which can assess the user's emotional attitude towards daily events in the office, trying to influence such attitude using affective strategies derived from a narrative model. This discussion is illustrated through examples from a first fully-implemented prototype. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The study of arguments as abstract entities and their interaction as introduced by Dung (1995) [1] has become one of the most active research branches within Artificial Intelligence and Reasoning. A main issue for abstract argumentation systems is the selection of acceptable sets of arguments. Value-based argumentation, as introduced by Bench-Capon (2003) [8], extends Dungs framework. It takes into account the relative strength of arguments with respect to some ranking representing an audience: an argument is subjectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to some audience, it is objectively accepted if it is accepted with respect to all audiences. Deciding whether an argument is subjectively or objectively accepted, respectively, are computationally intractable problems. In fact, the problems remain intractable under structural restrictions that render the main computational problems for non-value-based argumentation systems tractable. In this paper we identify nontrivial classes of value-based argumentation systems for which the acceptance problems are polynomial-time tractable. The classes are defined by means of structural restrictions in terms of the underlying graphical structure of the value-based system. Furthermore we show that the acceptance problems are intractable for two classes of value-based systems that where conjectured to be tractable by Dunne (2007) [12]. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although the field of persuasive technologies has lately attracted a lot of attention, only recently the notion of ambient persuasive technologies was introduced. Ambient persuasive technologies can be integrated into every aspect of life, and as such have greater persuasive power than the traditional box like machines. This article discusses ambient persuasion and poses a model that structures the knowledge from social sciences on persuasion, attitude change, and behavior change. Using this model the challenges of ambient persuasive technologies to fulfill its persuasive promises are identified. From the ambient persuasion model it is clear that ambient persuasive technologies can go beyond traditional persuasive technologies by being context and situational aware, by interpreting individual differences between users, and by being a social actor in their own right. © The Author(s) 2009.

AB  - This paper presents a new approach to predictive analysis for social processes. A key element of the proposed methodology is proper characterization of the interplay between the intrinsic aspects of a social process (e.g., the persuasiveness of an argument) and the social dynamics which is its realization (e.g., the way the argument propagates through a segment of society). We show that this interplay can be modeled within a novel multi-scale framework that is sociologically and mathematically sensible, expressive, illuminating, and amenable to formal analysis. We then develop a scientifically rigorous, computationally tractable approach to predictive analysis. Among other capabilities, this analytic approach enables assessment of process predictability, identification of measurables which have predictive power, discovery of reliable early indicators for events of interest, and scalable, robust prediction. The potential of the proposed approach is illustrated through a case study involving early warning analysis for mobilization/protest events. © 2009, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Of all computational systems, robots are unique in their ability to afford embodied interaction using the wider range of human communicative cues. Research on human communication provides strong evidence that embodied cues, when used effectively, elicit social, cognitive, and task outcomes such as improved learning, rapport, motivation, persuasion, and collaborative task performance. While this connection between embodied cues and key outcomes provides a unique opportunity for design, taking advantage of it requires a deeper understanding of how robots might use these cues effectively and the limitations in the extent to which they might achieve such outcomes through embodied interaction. This article aims to underline this opportunity by providing an overview of key embodied cues and outcomes in human communication and describing a research program that explores how robots might generate high-level social, cognitive, and task outcomes such as learning, rapport, and persuasion using embodied cues such as verbal, vocal, and nonverbal cues.

AB  - We explore how avatars can be used as social orthotics defined as therapeutic computer-based social companions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors. We review some of the health interventions deployed in helping at-risk populations along with some of the unique advantages that computer-based interventions can add to face-to-face interventions. We posit that artificial intelligence has rendered possible the creation of culturally appropriate dialogagents for interventions and we identify specific features for social avatars that are important - if not necessary - when applied to the domain of social orthotic systems for health promotion. © 2009 The Interactive Media Institute and IOS Press.

AB  - We describe an animated, conversational computer agent designed to promote antipsychotic medication adherence among patients with schizophrenia. In addition to medication adherence, the agent also promotes physical activity and system usage, and includes verbal and nonverbal behavior designed to foster a therapeutic alliance with patients. We discuss special considerations in designing interventions for this patient population, and challenges in developing and evaluating conversational agents in the mental health domain. Results from a pilot evaluation study of the agent indicate that it is accepted and effective. © 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Persuasive technologies are growing in popularity and many designers create systems which intentionally change users attitudes or behaviors. This study shows that peoples individual differences in susceptibility to persuasion, as implemented using the six persuasion principles proposed by Cialdini 2, relates to their compliance to a persuasive request which is accompanied by a persuasive cue. This result is a starting point for designers to start incorporating individual differences in susceptibility to persuasive cues in their adaptive persuasive systems. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - This paper studies how automated agents can persuade humans to behave in certain ways. The motivation behind such agent's behavior resides in the utility function that the agent's designer wants to maximize and which may be different from the user's utility function. Specifically, in the strategic settings studied, the agent provides correct yet partial information about a state of the world that is unknown to the user but relevant to his decision. Persuasion games were designed to study interactions between automated players where one player sends state information to the other to persuade it to behave in a certain way. We show that this game theory based model is not sufficient to model human-agent interactions, since people tend to deviate from the rational choice. We use machine learning to model such deviation in people from this game theory based model. The agent generates a probabilistic description of the world state that maximizes its benefit and presents it to the users. The proposed model was evaluated in an extensive empirical study involving road selection tasks that differ in length, costs and congestion. Results showed that people's behavior indeed deviated significantly from the behavior predicted by the game theory based model. Moreover, the agent developed in our model performed better than an agent that followed the behavior dictated by the game-theoretical models.

AB  - This paper describes a pilot investigation into the use of the social networking site Facebook as a platform for persuasive applications. The application domain is behaviour change in domestic energy consumption and the study focuses on determining peoples' attitudes towards the hypothetical coupling of the consumer product Wattson, which can monitor domestic electricity usage, to a Facebook application termed Watts Up. The Facebook application presents visualisations of users' own electricity consumption as well as that of their friends. Users' attitudes towards this notion were accumulated and analysed using grounded theory. Some user indications revealed negative opinions about the concept based, for instance, around privacy and confusion; however the balance of opinion appeared to favour the underlying idea that revealing other people's energy usage data would lead to competition and peer influence to reduce energy consumption.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for the creation of context-sensitive persuasive applications. The framework allows the authoring of new persuasive smart environments producing the appropriate feedback to the users based on different sensors spread throughout the environment to capture contextual information. Using this framework, we created an application, Smart Bins, aimed at promoting users' behavioural changes regarding the recycling of waste materials. Furthermore, to evaluate the usability of our authoring tool, we performed user tests to analyze if developers could successfully create the Smart Bins application using the framework. A description of the Smart Bins application, as well as the results of the user tests, are also presented in this paper. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2009.

AB  - The use of virtual agents to intelligently interface with online customers of e-commerce businesses is remarkably increasing. Most of these virtual agents are designed to assist online customers while searching for information related to a specific product or service, while few agents are intended for promoting and selling a product or a service. Within the later type, our aim is to provide proactive agents that recommend a specific item and justify this recommendation to a customer based on his purchases history and his needs. In this paper, we propose a dialectical argumentation approach that would allow virtual agents that have sales goals to trigger persuasions with e-commerce's customers. Then, we illustrate the proposed idea through its integration with an example from real-life. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The primary role of a decision support system is to guide and support a decision maker. As reliance on a decision support system is largely discretionary the persuasiveness of the system becomes critically important. In this paper characteristics thought to affect systems persuasiveness are examined. This paper asserts that the target and source of a decision support message, along with the design of the message itself, act to influence the persuasiveness of the decision support provided. Using a purpose built experimental platform with seventy subjects the research finds that the persuasiveness of a decision support message is varied by the perceived difficulty of the task being undertaken, and the perceived usefulness of the decision support provided. The type of decisional guidance provided also affects persuasiveness of the system; in particular, providing suggestive decisional guidance is shown to significantly improve system persuasiveness. The implications of these findings relate to the appropriate design of decision support systems, and the contexts within which a decision support system can be expected to persuade decision makers to reply on the support provided.

AB  - Fraud is increasing with the extensive use of internet and the increase of online transactions. More advanced solutions are desired to protect financial service companies and credit card holders from constantly evolving online fraud attacks. The main objective of this paper is to construct an efficient fraud detection system which is adaptive to the behavior changes by combining classification and clustering techniques. This is a two stage fraud detection system which compares the incoming transaction against the transaction history to identify the anomaly using BOAT algorithm in the first stage. In second stage to reduce the false alarm rate suspected anomalies are checked with the fraud history database and make sure that the detected anomalies are due to fraudulent transaction or any short term change in spending profile. In this work BOAT supports incremental update of transactional database and it handles maximum fraud coverage with high speed and less cost. Proposed model is evaluated on both synthetically generated and real life data and shows very good accuracy in detecting fraud transaction. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - In the context of the HANDS project [13], we argue that cognitive support systems designed for mobile devices may benefit from classical AI techniques as well as from Persuasive Technology. We investigate a system of stepwise instruction, called a Simple Safe Success Instructor, first in terms of scripts, and later in terms of Hierarchical Task Networks. The system under development is crafted for the benefit of young people with an autism-diagnosis, and the purpose is to support these in desired changes in attitude and behavior in dynamically changing environments.

AB  - We present the role of conversational agents in two task-oriented human-computer dialogue applications: Interactive Question Answering and Persuasive Dialogue. We show that conversational agents can be effectively deployed for interaction that goes beyond user entertainment and can be successfully used as a means to achieve complex tasks. Conversational agents are a winning solution in Persuasive Dialogue because, combined with a planning infrastructure, they can help manage the parts of the dialogue that cannot be planned a priori and are primordial to keep the system persuasive. In Interactive Question Answering, conversational approaches lead users to the explicit formulation of queries, allow for the submission of further queries and accomodate related queries thanks to their ability to handle context. © 2011, IGI Global.

AB  - For Dung's theory of abstract argumentation, algorithms have been introduced for enumerating all preferred extensions. Two specific approaches have been set out that are based on labeling arguments as: IN, OUT or UNDEC. The purpose of this paper is to improve the two existing approaches by introducing two enhancements. Firstly, we employ two more informative labels. Secondly, by using these additional labels, we describe a new scheme for how the arguments' labels change in the course of computing the preferred extensions. Supported by empirical evaluation, we argue that these modifications accelerate computations. Moreover, we show how to apply the new algorithm in the context of value-based frameworks for persuasive argument, and hence, it appears that the new algorithm is usable in other formalisms extending Dung's model. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - In this paper, we consider how we can detect patterns in data streams that are serial Markovian, where target behaviors are Markovian, but targets may switch from one Markovian behavior to another. We want to reliably and promptly detect behavior changes. Traditional Markov-model-based pattern detection approaches, such as hidden Markov models, use maximum likelihood techniques over the entire data stream to detect behaviors. To detect changes between behaviors, we use statistical pattern matching calculations performed on a sliding window of data samples. If the window size is very small, the system will suffer from excessive false-positive rates. If the window is very large, change-point detection is delayed. This paper finds both necessary and sufficient bounds on the window size. We present two methods of calculating window sizes based on the state and transition structures of the Markov models. Two application examples are presented to verify our results. Our first example problem uses simulations to illustrate the utility of the proposed approaches. The second example uses models extracted from a database of consumer purchases to illustrate their use in a real application. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is an autonomous network that consists of mobile nodes that communicate with each other over wireless links. An advent of new technologies and the demand for flexibility and ease in working environment, the use of Mobile Ad hoc computing is growing fast. Besides their use, Mobile Ad hoc networks (MANET) are assumed to grow in size too. They function in independent groups, containing some tens of nodes up to several hundreds of nodes. As the network size increases, it becomes common for the nodes to be dispersed in a larger area than the radio range of individual nodes. Under such conditions, we have to employ routing techniques such that the out of range nodes may communicate with each other via intermediate nodes. This problem of routing in mobile ad hoc networks is our focus of discussion in this paper, and a protocol is proposed as a solution. However, as the greedy algorithm used in Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) protocol will choose the nodes with stronger coverability that creates the overlap of nodes in the MultiPoint Relay (MPR) selection, which will reduce the performance of the network. Multipoint Relaying is a technique to reduce the number of redundant retransmissions while diffusing a broadcast message in the network. Optimized Multicast Routing (OMR) protocol is able to change behavior in different situations in order to improve the metric like delivery ratio of the packet and throughput. The protocol is augmented by an optimization scheme, adapted from OLSR Protocol in which only selected neighbor nodes propagate the control packets to reduce the amount of control overhead in the network. The MultiPoint Relay (MPR) based mechanism of OLSR is used to perform an Optimized Forwarding Mechanism to efficiently do the flooding of broadcast messages in the Mobile Ad hoc Network. So, the number of MPRs is a key for the performance of the OLSR. An algorithm called Necessity First Algorithm (NFA) is used to select the optimal MultiPoint Relays in OMR protocol with the goal of solving performance problem of greedy algorithm. © 2010 Kongu Engineering College.

AB  - Automatic detection of persuasion is essential for machine interaction on the social web. To facilitate automated persuasion detection, we present a novel microtext corpus derived from hostage negotiation transcripts as well as a detailed manual (codebook) for persuasion annotation. Our corpus, called the NPS Persuasion Corpus, consists of 37 transcripts from four sets of hostage negotiation transcriptions. Each utterance in the corpus is hand annotated for one of nine categories of persuasion based on Cialdini's model: reciprocity, commitment, consistency, liking, authority, social proof, scarcity, other, and not persuasive. Initial results using three supervised learning algorithms (Naïve Bayes, Maximum Entropy, and Support Vector Machines) combined with gappy and orthogonal sparse bigram feature expansion techniques show that the annotation process did capture machine learnable features of persuasion with F-scores better than baseline.

AB  - Embodied Conversational Agents (ECA) are computer-animated characters that simulate face-to-face conversation with patients. These agents can be programmed with best practices in human-human health communication and used for automated health education and behavior change counseling interventions. Evidence is presented from two ongoing clinical trials demonstrating that patients at different levels of health literacy find these agents acceptable and easy to use for automated health communication interventions. Innovative computer interface systems can be used to ensure that inadequate health literacy not serve as a barrier to interventions using health information technology.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a persuasive ambient display to promote walking exercise. The display is originally a daily object like a mirror, and provides information about one's exercise level on the periphery of a line of sight. Four strategies for walking encouragement are specified as hypothetical motivational elements: 1) pleasurable interaction with information obtained through daily activity, 2) supporting reflection on each day's walking, 3) avoiding negative feeling while providing negative feedback and 4) facilitating interpersonal encouragement. A case study on information presentation is presented to see the feasibility and effectiveness and to explore further requirements, where a mirror is augmented. © 2009 The authors and IOS Press.

The model is given in terms of ABA-specific utterances, trees drawn from dialogues and legal-move and outcome functions. We prove a formal connection between these dialogues and argumentation semantics. We illustrate persuasion as an application of the dialogue model.

AB  - Persuasion is the activity of demonstrating and trying to modify the behavior of at least one person through symbolic interaction. This book surveys formal models of persuasion dialog that are now widely used in argumentation and artificial intelligence as tools for the identification, analysis and evaluation of arguments. Within the sports arena, coaches and athletes routinely look for ways to improve performance. While most of these attempts tend to focus on physical practice, the role of the mind, and psychological factors such as self-efficacy, has become increasingly important. The research and theory within this area are explored and the authors make recommendations with regards to the content and delivery of pep talks. Furthermore, it is well-known that most advertising persuades by argument and most of those arguments are logical. The authors apply Gilbert's Multimodal Argumentation Model to a series of advertisements. In addition, a peculiar kind of persuasive communication is discussed: the fictitious argument between a human being and personified death. As the choice of German-speaking texts examined here exemplifies, the dialogic and rhetorically structured way of dealing with the mortal threat has been living on well into Modern times. Other chapters explore current research on regulatory fit and persuasion into the larger contexts of elaboration likelihood and transportation likelihood. Current research on how regulatory fit affects persuasion through advocacy messages and through narratives is looked at as well. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is well known that argumentation can usefully be analysed as a distinct, if complex, type of speech act. Speech acts that form a part of argumentative discourse, and in particular, of argumentative dialogue, can be seen as anchors for the establishment of inferences between propositions in the domain of discourse. Most often, the speech acts that directly give rise to inference are implicit, but can be drawn out in analysis by consideration of the type of dialogue game being played. AI approaches to argumentation often focus solely on such inferences as the means by which persuasion can be effected - but this is in contrast with psychological and rhetorical models which have long recognised the role played by extra-logical features of the dialogical context. These 'peripheral' cues can not only affect persuasive effect of the logical, 'central' argumentation, but can override and dominate it. This paper presents a theory which allows both central and peripheral aspects of argumentation to be represented in a coherent analytical account based on the sequences of speech acts which constitute dialogues.

AB  - Persuasive conversational agents persuade people to change their attitudes or behaviors through conversation, and are expected to be applied as virtual sales clerks in e-shopping sites. As an approach to create such an agent, we have developed a learning agent with the Wizard of Oz method in which a person called Wizard talks to the user pretending to be the agent. The agent observes the conversations between the Wizard and the user, and learns how to persuade people. In this method, the Wizard has to reply to most of the user's inputs at the beginning, but the burden gradually falls because the agent learns how to reply as the conversation model grows. Generally speaking, persuasion tactics is important to persuade people efficiently, but it is also useful to reduce the burden of the Wizard because it guides the Wizard to a way of persuasion. In this paper, we explicitly implement persuasion tactics into the persuasive conversation agent. Evaluation experiments show that the burden (the input ratio) of the Wizard was reduced from 55% (without tactics) to 33% (with tactics), although the success ratio of persuasion was little improved. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Ayiti: The Cost of Life is a very successful edutainment game pursuing persuasive aims through an unusually high level of difficulty. Analyzing this game, comprehending its unfolding meaning-making processes and describing its persuasive effectiveness is a challenging task1. To achieve it, it will be necessary to discuss how semiotics, ludology and procedural criticism intend narrativity in relation to games, A novel approach, based on Peirce's notion of habit, will be used to overcome some analytical shortcomings of current theories. Three of the habits emerging from Ayiti's narrative unfolding will be more detailedly discussed in order to finally describe its didactic, persuasive functioning. ©2009, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Recently we have seen a few development in argumentation-based dialogue systems, but there is less research in understanding agents' strategic behaviour in dialogues. We study agent strategies by linking a specific form of argumentation-based dialogues and mechanism design. Specifically, focusing on persuasion dialogues, we show how dialogues can be mapped to concepts in mechanism design. We prove that a 'truthful' and 'thorough' dialogue strategy is a dominant strategy under specific conditions. We also prove that a mechanism using this dialogue strategy implements a 'persuasion social choice function' we define. These results show the validity of the proposed strategies for agents in persuasion and the feasibility of studying persuasion with mechanism design techniques. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Attitudes play a significant role in determining how individuals process information and behave. In this paper we have developed a new computational model of population wide attitude change that captures the social level: how individuals interact and communicate information, and the cognitive level: how attitudes and concept interact with each other. The model captures the cognitive aspect by representing each individuals as a parallel constraint satisfaction network. The dynamics of this model are explored through a simple attitude change experiment where we vary the social network and distribution of attitudes in a population.

AB  - In this paper we explore a fundamental characteristic of Ambient Persuasive Technology: Can it persuade the user without receiving the user's conscious attention? In a task consisting of 90 trials, participants had to indicate which of three household appliances uses the lowest average amount of energy. After each choice, participants in the supraliminal feedback condition received feedback about the correctness of their choice through presentation of a smiling or a sad face for 150 ms. Participants in the subliminal feedback condition received identical feedback, but the faces were presented only for 25 ms, which prohibited conscious perception of these stimuli. The final third of the participants received no feedback. In the next task, participants rated the energy consumption of all presented appliances. Results indicated that supraliminal feedback and subliminal feedback both led to more correct energy consumption ratings as compared to receiving no feedback. Implications are discussed.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel application area of smart objects, changing users' behavior. By analyzing user contexts acquired by smart objects, applications provide users with appropriate feedbacks to change their behavior. This study demonstrates a concept called ambient lifestyle feedback systems to be used to motivate people to change their undesirable habits to improve their lifestyle. We present three case studies of ambient lifestyle feedback systems, and discuss some findings to design persuasive applications using smart objects. We also discuss future directions of the study.

AB  - In this paper we consider the issues involved in influencing a user in an interactive storytelling context using results from the social psychology's area of persuasion. We hypothesize that it is possible to use these results in order to influence the user in predictable ways. Several important concepts of persuasion, such as how people make decisions, and how can we influence that process are discussed. We describe a proposal on how to apply these results in an interactive storytelling setting and describe a small study were we have successfully influenced the players of a story in following a specific path by using an expert source manipulation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Visual feedback is an important approach in persuasive technology. We present four significant design dimensions of persuasive feedback systems. We investigate several previous notable projects and find out the underlying metaphorical structures within them. We analyze the meaning of metaphor in the persuasive feedback design, and examine how metaphor is being used. The results tell us that metaphor analysis plays a useful role in interpreting the creativity of visual design in the persuasive feedback system.

AB  - Exergames encourage physical activity, but generally require specialized hardware and prescribed activities; whereas pervasive accumulated context exergames (PACEs) allow players to choose their type of exercise, but have limited depth of play. For mass commercialization of PACEs, facilitating long-term behavioural change, we propose two requirements: that PACEs support large-scale and flexible deployment; and that the design of PACEs support staying power through long-term playability. From these requirements, we motivate six PACE design principles and use these principles to develop a multiplayer roleplaying PACE. Results from a week-long study of our game showed that by satisfying the six design principles, we can create a PACE with scalability and staying power. Our results are the first step toward creating PACEs that promotes long-term game engagement, which is needed for activity-related behaviour change. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this paper we introduce the context of a semiconductor factory as a promising area for the application of innovative interaction approaches. In order to increase efficiency ambient persuasive interfaces, which influence the operators' behaviour to perform in an optimized way, could constitute a potential strategy. We present insights gained from qualitative studies conducted in a specific semiconductor factory and provide a description of typical work processes and already deployed interfaces in this context. These findings informed the design of a prototype of an ambient persuasive interface within this realm - the "Operator Guide". Its overall aim is to improve work efficiency, while still maintaining a minimal error rate. We provide a detailed description of the Operator Guide along with an outlook of the next steps within a user-centered design approach. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Depression affects approximately 15% of the US population, and is recognized as an important risk factor for poor outcomes among patients with various illnesses. Automated health education and behavior change programs have the potential to help address many of the shortcomings in health care. However, the role of these systems in the care of patients with depression has been insufficiently examined. In the current study, we sought to evaluate how hospitalized medical patients would respond to a computer animated conversational agent that has been developed to provide information in an empathic fashion about a patient's hospital discharge plan. In particular, we sought to examine how patients who have a high level of depressive symptoms respond to this system. Therapeutic alliance - the trust and belief that a patient and provider have in working together to achieve a desired therapeutic outcome - was used as the primary outcome measure, since it has been shown to be important in predicting outcomes across a wide range of health problems, including depression. In an evaluation of 139 hospital patients who interacted with the agent at the time of discharge, all patients, regardless of depressive symptoms, rated the agent very high on measures of satisfaction and ease of use, and most preferred receiving their discharge information from the agent compared to their doctors or nurses in the hospital. In addition, we found that patients with symptoms indicative of major depression rated the agent significantly higher on therapeutic alliance compared to patients who did not have major depressive symptoms. We conclude that empathic agents represent a promising technology for patient assessment, education and counseling for those most in need of comfort and caring in the inpatient setting. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Creativity is widely used in advertisements, and is meant to be appreciated by people. However creativity can also be used as a defense. When we walk in the street we are overwhelmed by messages which try to get our attention with any persuasive device at hand. As messages get ever more aggressive, often our basic cognitive defense - trying not to perceive those messages - is not sufficient. One advanced defensive technique is based on transforming the perceived message into something different (for instance irony or hyperbole) from what was originally meant in the message. In this paper we describe an implemented application for smartphones that creatively modifies the linguistic expression in a virtual copy of the poster. The mobile system is inspired by the subvertising practice of countercultural art, and aims at experiencing aesthetic pleasure that relaxes the cognitive tension of the user.

AB  - Parents looking to foster more energy sufficient behaviours in their children struggle to have their child maintain these behaviours unsupervised. Our research indicates that in order for the child to maintain these behaviours, s/he must perceive him/herself as an eco conscious individual. We propose that increasing a child's ability to firstly recognise eco-friendly behaviours and secondly, recollect them, is likely to yield a greater affinity for habitual energy sufficient behaviours. This paper describes a first prototype game, whose interface employs availability heuristics and other persuasive design elements to achieve this goal. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.

AB  - Background: The number of elderly people in need of help with the activities of daily living in the EU is rapidly increasing, while the number of young workers is decreasing. Elderly care will, therefore, also have to be provided by intelligent computer systems. Methods: A prototype elderly-care system, developed at the Jožef Stefan Institute, mostly as part of the Confidence project, is presented. The prototype detects falls and behavior changes in the elderly. It learns from experience and is based on intelligent interpretation of movement patterns. Tree sets of tests were performed to evaluate its properties on various subjects when engaged in normal activities, falling and imitations of several health problems under medical supervision. The key novelty was in location-based sensors and advanced intelligent methods. Results: The prototype using the Ubisense sensor system, which detects the locations of tags worn on the body, correctly recognized 96% of falls, significantly outperforming simple accelerometer-based systems. In addition, it recognized up to 99% of abnormal behavior. Conclusions: Experimental results showed that an intelligent system coupled with advanced location sensors can achieve the level of performance needed in real life. The system offers significantly better performance than commercially available solutions, and once the price of sensors decreases, its widespread application seems likely.

This paper addresses the development of an adaptive persuasive system intended to increase stair climbing at work: APStairs. Based on their persuasion profile, individuals are distinguished by their susceptibility to different social influence strategies. This paper contributes a first application of persuasion profiling in the domain of ambient intelligence; it reports the deployment of the APStairs system in a real life setting for a period of five weeks involving 34 participants. Although a longer deployment period is needed to statistically validate the system, this first deployment of the system has shown the feasibility of adaptive persuasion. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - In this paper we present a data-driven approach to modeling end user energy consumption in residential and commercial buildings. Our model is based upon a data set of monthly electricity and gas bills, collected by a utility over the course of several years, for approximately 6,500 buildings in Cambridge, MA. In addition, we use publicly available tax assessor records and geographical survey information to determine corresponding features for the buildings. Using both parametric and non-parametric learning methods, we learn models that predict distributions over energy usage based upon these features, and use these models to develop two end-user systems. For utilities or authorized institutions (those who may obtain access to the full data) we provide a system that visualizes energy consumption for each building in the city; this allows companies to quickly identify outliers (buildings which use much more energy than expected even after conditioning on the relevant predictors), for instance allowing them to target homes for potential retrofits or tiered pricing schemes. For other end users, we provide an interface for entering their own electricity and gas usage, along with basic information about their home, to determine how their consumption compares to that of similar buildings as predicted by our model. Merely allowing users to contextualize their consumption in this way, relating it to the consumption in similar buildings, can itself produce behavior changes to significantly reduce consumption.

AB  - This video presents a study on how a physical game based on a mobile robot can be used as a persuasive tool for promoting physical activity among elderly. The goal of the game is to take a ball from a robot, and afterwards try to hand it back while the robot moves. The robot records the behavior patterns of each individual player and gradually adapts the challenge of the game to the player's skill. The game was investigated in two independent field studies. The primary goal was to observe how the robot adapts to players with different mobility problems, secondly to obtain knowledge about the different play patterns and get ideas about future improvements of the game. The video shows different examples of how the elderly would play with the robot and illustrates the variety of play styles.

AB  - IPO under-pricing phenomenon is popular widely in various capital markets in the world. Which is always regarded as one difficult area in financial research. So far, many researchers contribute and draw conclusions based on different theories. Furthermore, based on behavioral finance theory, the explanations become further persuasive. But more evidences are also be needed to support them. This paper, based on previous studies and behavioral finance theory, analyzes firstly factors influence on IPO under-pricing by sampling China's SME and GEM stock markets. Then, applying sequential sequent regression approaches to determine the main reasons IPO under-pricing. The results show that the factor of heterogeneous expectation affect obviously on IPO under-pricing in both markets, while investor sentiment only significantly affects on IPO under-pricing in SME market. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - We present an architecture for interactive storytelling. The system interleaves pre-authored text and videos to generate a story. Between iterations, the player is given an opportunity to answer questions that help to drive the narrative. Videos are used to have an effect on the emotional response of the players. The system is capable of performing modeling of both videos and players to better adapt the narrative progression in response to the player's answers to questions. The system is designed to serve two purposes: 1) to label natural language utterances and passages for use in a text classification system; and 2) to serve as a test environment for computational models of influence and persuasion. We motivate the approach we have taken by describing research efforts on classifying emotion in natural language and on the use of influence to affect decision making. The architecture and prototype system is described in detail. A summary of human-subject experiments planned are included as well. © 2009 Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - Increasing the efficiency in production while maintaining a low error rate is one of the key goals of semiconductor factories. Often this is achieved on a technical level but there is significant potential on the human side as well. By reducing the complexity of the work environment and presenting the right information at the right time and place operators can be supported in their decision making process and therefore the productivity can be increased. Ambient Persuasion, which combines ambient intelligence and persuasive technology, is a promising approach in this direction. In this paper we present the "Operator Guide", an ambient persuasive system that aims to improve work efficiency and to reduce error response times of operators by showing the next best working steps. We provide a detailed description of the Operator Guide along with an outlook of the next steps within a user-centered design approach. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes the design and preliminary evaluation of Aulura, a system designed for motivating people to increase their physical activity. Aulura is an ambient information display that aims to 'lure' users to interact with it, to review their progress and set personal goals. We present the design of 'ambient cues' added to a picture frame with the aim to increase user interaction with the device and engagement with a physical activity promotion service. Empirical evaluation in a home simulation laboratory provided positive feedback relating to its potential to further engage participants in an online lifestyle management service. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This research was designed to investigate the effects of automation attitude adjustment techniques and experience on users' attitudes towards automated decision aids. Fifty-five participants (nursing students and registered nurses (RNs)) volunteered for this study. Participants were administered an Automation Attitude Questionnaire (AAQ) prior to participating in experiments using a computerized Nursing Diagnosis Decision Aid (NDDA). The experimental task required participants to manually diagnose 13 patient case studies and then evaluate automated diagnoses by either accepting or rejecting each NDDA decision. During experimentation, some participants were exposed one of two different automation attitude adjustment techniques (persuasive appeal using explanations and suggestions regarding the operation and capabilities of the NDDA delivered through a text message or an NDDA degree of accuracy indicator). Each technique had two levels (high and low) and participants were exposed to only one level. After the experimental trials, participants were administered another AAQ to determine the effects of the techniques on their attitudes toward automation. Results of the study indicate that participants' attitudes can indeed be improved by high levels of automation accuracy or worsened by low accuracy. The data also indicated that the nursing students were generally more accepting of automated decision aid information than RNs.

AB  - with the rapid development of online shopping, on-line one-to-one marketing becomes a great assistance to e-shoppers. One of the most important marketing resources is the prior daily transaction records in the database. In this study, the paper propose a new methodology for predict e-shoppers' purchase behavior that uses e-shoppers' purchase sequences. First, transaction clustering is conducted, then it is made that detecting the evolving e-shopper purchase sequences as time passes, and the e-shoppers behaviors, which are derived from a change in the cluster number of each e-shopper, are kept in the purchase sequence database. Finally, sequential purchase patterns over user-specified minimum support and confidence are extracted by using the association rule. The sequential purchase patterns are then stored in the association rule database. The better result is achieved by applying the new methodogy to a given example for e-shoppers. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - This paper focuses on the issue of premissary relevance as a challenge faced in health promotion interventions. To promote attitude change and influence health behavior, it is crucial that we use premises that are relevant on an individual level. Relevance in argumentation refers both to the fact that the premises should relate to the standpoint at issue, as well as the interlocutors' acceptance of these premises. We claim that autonomous argumentation systems hold the promise to enable proper argumentative exchanges that capture and address what matters to individuals. To do so, however, there is a need to consider and operationalize theories of argumentation that enable a reconstruction of the different stages of argumentation. The theory of argumentation known as pragma-dialectics can offer a promising basis for the architecture of autonomous health promotion advisors.

AB  - We explore how avatars can be used as social orthotics defined as therapeutic computer-based social companions aimed at promoting healthy behaviors. We review some of the health interventions deployed in helping at-risk populations along with some of the unique advantages that computer-based interventions can add to face-to-face interventions. We posit that artificial intelligence has rendered possible the creation of culturally appropriate dialog-agents for interventions and we identify specific features for social avatars that are important - if not necessary - when applied to the domain of social orthotic systems for health promotion.

AB  - Exercise is vital to maintaining good health, but many people neglect to work out regularly or often enough. One reason is the lack of will to take part in physical activities. We believe that interactive technologies can play a role in providing entertaining and implicitly educational mechanisms that will help people pursue healthy physical activities. As an example to our approach we present a mixed reality pet, Mootchi, which will provide users with an emotional incentive for exercising, indirectly acting as a persuasive physical trainer. This short paper outlines our prototype implementation and initial findings based on a design critique of Mootchi. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Lane changing can increase or impede the flow of vehicular traffic, depending on traffic density and the lane-changing strategies used by individual drivers. We implement and extend the Nagel-Schreckenberg (N-S) traffic model as an agent-based model to investigate lane-changing behavior on a multi-lane roadway, with the goal of determining which lane changing strategies result in the greatest overall traffic flow. We show that in heavier traffic, an aggressive lane changing policy may be beneficial for overall traffic flow. Copyright © 2011, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence.

Several important concepts of persuasion such as how people make decisions, and how can we influence the process of decision are discussed. We end with a proposal on how to apply these results in an interactive story-telling setting. Copyright ©2010, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence. All rights reserved.

AB  - Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) based attacks are caused by compromised hosts in the LAN and mainly involve spoofing with falsified IP-MAC pairs. Since ARP is a stateless protocol such attacks are possible. Neither there are signatures available for these attacks nor any significant statistical behavior change can be observed. So existing signature or anomaly intrusion detection systems are unable to detect these type of attacks. Several schemes have been proposed in the literature to circumvent these attacks, however, these techniques either make IP-MAC pairing static, modify the existing ARP, violate network layering architecture etc. In this paper a host based Discrete Event System (DES) approach is proposed for detecting ARP spoofing attacks. This approach does not require any extra constraint like static IP-MAC, changing the ARP or violation of network layering architecture. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Burden of proof has recently come to be a topic of interest in argumentation systems for artificial intelligence (Prakken and Sartor, 2006, 2007, 2009; Gordon and Walton, 2007, 2009), but so far the main work on the subject seems to be in that type of dialogue which has most intensively been investigated generally, namely persuasion dialogue. The most significant exception is probably deliberation dialogue, where some recent work has begun to tentatively investigate burden of proof in that setting. In this paper, I survey work on burden of proof in the artificial intelligence literature on argumentation, and offer some thoughts on how this work might be extended to the other types of dialogue recognized by Walton and Krabbe (1995) that so far do not appear to have been much investigated in this regard. © 2010 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper describes a robotic game intended to persuade players to consume healthy food for an extended period of time. Peer pressure, competitiveness and deception are used as persuasive techniques. The game implied that the only factor for determining who won or lost was the players' response time. However, results were changed imperceptibly during game play to promote engagement and a longer interaction time. The ethics of deception in human-robot interactions is a topic worth discussion.

AB  - This paper propose the use of multi-agent based simulation (MABS) to allow testing, validating and verifying Ambient Intelligence (AmI) environments in a flexible and robust way. The development of AmI is very complex because of this technology must often adapt to contextual information as well as unpredictable and changeable behaviours. The concrete simulation is called Ubik and is integrated into the AmISim architecture which is also presented in this paper. This architecture deals with AmI applications in order to discover defects, estimate quality of applications, help to make decisions about the design, etc. The paper shows that Ubik and AmISim provide a simulation framework which can test scenarios that would be impossible in real environments or even with previous AmI simulation approaches. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper describes the development of a corpus of blog posts that are annotated for the presence of attempts to persuade and corresponding tactics employed in persuasive messages. We investigate the feasibility of classifying blog posts as persuasive or non-persuasive on the basis of lexical features in the text and the tactics (as provided by human annotators). Annotated tactics provide substantial assistance in classifying persuasion, particularly tactics indicating formal reasoning, deontic obligation, and discussions of possible outcomes, suggesting that learning to identify tactics may be an excellent first step to detecting attempts to persuade.

AB  - The literature in argumentation and artificial intelligence has distinguished five types of burden of proof in persuasion dialogs, but there appears to have been no serious investigation so far on how burdens of proof should be modeled in deliberation dialogs. The work in this paper is directed toward filling that gap by extending existing formal models of deliberation dialog to analyze four examples of deliberation dialog where burden of proof is at issue or poses an interesting problem. The examples are used to show (1) that the eight stages in the formal model of Hitchcock, McBurney and Parsons (2007) need to be divided into three more general stages, an opening stage, an argumentation stage and a closing stage, (2) that deliberation dialog shifts to persuasion dialog during the argumentation stage, and (3) that burden of proof is only operative during the argumentation stage. What is shown in general is that deliberation is, in the typical type of case, a mixed dialog in which there is a shift to persuasion dialog in the middle. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2010.

This model will show how typical stories - sequences of events that form a meaningful whole - can be used to set an example for an agent and how the agent might adapt his own values and choices according to the values and choices made by the characters in the story.

AB  - In this paper we examine the problem of practical reasoning utilising Atkinson et al.'s argument scheme in situations where differences as to the desirability of social value promotion exists. We focus on the situation where a single speaker attempts to persuade a set of listeners to undertake an action, assuming that the speaker has only a probabilistic model of the listener's mental state. To achieve this, we provide a new mapping from Atkinson's argumentation scheme to a VAF, introducing a new epistemic level to the VAF. We then present a simple protocol for the interaction between a single speaker and the set of listeners. Finally, situations in which strategic reasoning is necessary for the speaker are identified. © 2012 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to shed some light on the concept of virality - especially in social networks - and to provide new insights on its structure. We argue that: (a) virality is a phenomenon strictly connected to the nature of the content being spread, rather than to the influencers who spread it (b) virality is a phenomenon with many facets, i.e. under this generic term several different effects of persuasive communication are comprised and they only partially overlap. To give ground to our claims, we provide initial experiments in a machine learning framework to show how various aspects of virality can be independently predicted according to content features.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the possibility to extend PORTIA, a persuasion system currently applied in human-agent dialogs, to support ambient persuasion. We have identified a fitness center as an appropriate smart environment in which ambient persuasion strategies can be applied. According to the Ubiquitous Computing vision, in the fitness center the user is surrounded by several connected devices that cooperate in the persuasion process, each of them with the most appropriate strategy, mode of persuasion, style of communication and ability of exploiting the kairos principle. © ICT&S Center, University of Salzburg.

AB  - Ideal models of dialectical argumentation, such the pragma-dialectical critical discussion or Walton and Krabbe's persuasion dialogues, comprise of a set of rules that define reasonable argumentation under idealised conditions. Assuming such conditions, dialectical rules are meant to secure an orderly procedure for testing opinions. However, in actual circumstances violations of argumentative rules - identified as fallacies - can and do occur. Pragma-dialectics treats fallacies as "derailments of strategic manoeuvring", that is, contraventions of dialectical rules for a critical discussion committed by actual arguers for rhetorical gains. Hence, the predicament of actual argumentation is a possible (but not necessary) trade-off between dialectical constraints and rhetorical opportunities. In this paper I preliminarily conceptualise a different predicament that actual arguers may face. The sets of dialectical rules proposed in ideal models of argumentation are consistent and thus unproblematic, as long as they presuppose idealised conditions. However, when put to work in actual procedures for argumentation, the rules may clash with one another. For instance, the freedom to unlimitedly criticise the opponent may hinder the progress towards rational resolution of a difference of opinion. As a result, arguers may face a predicament in which the only way to observe one of the rules of reasonable argumentation is to violate another one. I call such possible clashes dialectical trade-offs, because they are clashes between dialectical rules that arise in actual circumstances of argumentation. Dialectical trade-offs are practical concerns that do not undermine the general composition and usefulness of the ideal models. Yet, they point to a practical difficulty in designing consistent and applicable protocols for reasonable argumentation. I will illustrate this difficulty by contrasting two kinds of protocols for computer-mediated deliberation: Internet forums for informal deliberation and formal models of deliberative dialogues developed within the field of Artificial Intelligence.

AB  - More than half of the solar energy absorbed by land surfaces is currently used to evaporate water. Climate change is expected to intensify the hydrological cycle and to alter evapotranspiration, with implications for ecosystem services and feedback to regional and global climate. Evapotranspiration changes may already be under way, but direct observational constraints are lacking at the global scale. Until such evidence is available, changes in the water cycle on land-a key diagnostic criterion of the effects of climate change and variability-remain uncertain. Here we provide a data-driven estimate of global land evapotranspiration from 1982 to 2008, compiled using a global monitoring network, meteorological and remote-sensing observations, and a machine-learning algorithm. In addition, we have assessed evapotranspiration variations over the same time period using an ensemble of process-based land-surface models. Our results suggest that global annual evapotranspiration increased on average by 7.1 ± 1.0 millimetres per year per decade from 1982 to 1997. After that, coincident with the last major El Ni±o event in 1998, the global evapotranspiration increase seems to have ceased until 2008. This change was driven primarily by moisture limitation in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly Africa and Australia. In these regions, microwave satellite observations indicate that soil moisture decreased from 1998 to 2008. Hence, increasing soil-moisture limitations on evapotranspiration largely explain the recent decline of the global land-evapotranspiration trend. Whether the changing behaviour of evapotranspiration is representative of natural climate variability or reflects a more permanent reorganization of the land water cycle is a key question for earth system science. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

AB  - We present an empirical study of the effect of a computer agent designed to engage a user in a persuasive counseling dialogue on attitudes towards regular exercise. We used two manipulations: (1) how closely the agent simulated human conversation, using either an embodied conversational agent (ECA) or a text-only agent, and (2) whether the agent attempted to build a user-agent relationship through social dialogue. Participants demonstrated a significant increase in positive attitudes (persuasion) following the persuasive dialogue; however, this change was significantly smaller when the agent used social dialogue. Participants' perceptions of the dialogue were most positive for an ECA with social dialogue, or a text-only agent without. Copyright © 2009 ACM.

AB  - Categorization is inevitable in the process of designing persuasive software. Having said that, there has not yet been paid much attention to the role of categorization within the field of Persuasive Design. When a designer categorizes what elements should be part of the persuasive software he must always consider the user in order to achieve the most suitable categorization in relation to his intention. This article will show how theories of Epistemic Rhetoric and Cognitive Science both emphasize the role of categorization and how they supplement each other in an understanding of the user and how human beings categorize in order to comprehend and make sense of concepts. In a concluding example it will show how two furniture warehouses with seemingly similar persuasive intentions have chosen different categorizations that consequently result in different persuasive outcomes. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Human negotiators can persuade the opponents to revise their beliefs in order to maximise the chance of reaching an agreement. Existing negotiation models are weak in supporting persuasive negotiations. This paper illustrates an adaptive and persuasive negotiation agent model, which is underpinned by a belief revision logic. These belief-based negotiation agents are able to learn from the changing negotiation contexts and persuade their opponents to change their positions. Our preliminary experiments show that the belief-based adaptive negotiation agents outperform a classical negotiation model under time pressure. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2004.

AB  - We present an implementation of a model of very early sensory-motor development, guided by results from developmental psychology. Behavioral acquisition and growth is demonstrated through constraint-lifting mechanisms initiated by global state variables. The results show how staged competence can be shaped by qualitative behavior changes produced by anatomical, computational and maturational constraints.

AB  - Behavior selection is typically a "built-in" feature of behavior-based architectures and hence, not amenable to change. There are, however, circumstances where changing behavior selection strategies is useful and can lead to better performance. In this paper, we demonstrate that such dynamic changes of behavior selection mechanisms are beneficial in several circumstances. We first categorize existing behavior selection mechanisms along three dimensions and then discuss seven possible circumstances where dynamically switching among them can be beneficial. Using the agent architecture framework activation, priority, observer, and component (APOC), we show how instances of all (nonempty) categories can be captured and how additional architectural mechanisms can be added to allow for dynamic switching among them. In particular, we propose a generic architecture for dynamic behavior selection, which can integrate existing behavior selection mechanisms in a unified way. Based on this generic architecture, we then verify that dynamic behavior selection is beneficial in the seven cases by defining architectures for simulated and robotic agents and performing experiments with them. The quantitative and qualitative analyzes of the results obtained from extensive simulation studies and experimental runs with robots verify the utility of the proposed mechanisms. © 2004 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of much computer science research is to invent algorithms, and generate evidence to convince others that the new methods are worthwhile. All too often, however, the work has no impact, because the supporting evidence does not meet basic standards of rigor or persuasiveness. Here the notion of "experiment" is explored, with reference to our current investigation into distributed text query processing on a cluster of computers. We describe some of the issues that we encountered, and lessons that can be applied by researchers designing experiments in other areas of computing. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Different approaches have investigated the syntax and semantic of agent communication. However, all these approaches (including : agent communication languages, conversation policies and dialogue games) have not indicated how agents should dynamically use communications. In fact, most of these approaches have mainly focused on "structure" of dialogues even though developers are more interested in agents' capabilities of having "useful" conversations in respect to their goals rather than in their abilities to structure dialogues. This leads us to propose a theory of use of conversations between agents. This pragmatic theory extends and adapts the cognitive dissonance theory (a major theory of social psychology) to multi-agent systems. In this paper, we show how this theory allows us to provide generic conceptual tools for the automation of both agent communicational behavior and attitude change processes. The cognitive coherence that we propose is formulated in terms of constraints and elements of cognition and allows us to define cognitive incoherences and dialogue utility measures. We show how these measures could be used to solve common problems and answer some critical questions concerning agent communication frameworks use. Finally, the theory is illustrated with an example of dialogue games automatic use.

AB  - One form of argument-based negotiation is when agents argue about why an offer was rejected. If an agent can state a reason for a rejection of an offer, the negotiation process may become more efficient since the other agent can take this reason into account when making new offers. Also, if a reason for rejection can be disputed, the negotiation process may be of higher quality since flawed reasons may be revised as a result. This paper presents a formal protocol for negotiation in which reasons can be asked and given for rejections and in which agents can try to persuade each other that a reason is or is not acceptable. The protocol is modelled as a persuasion dialogue game embedded in a negotiation protocol. It has a social semantics since the protocol does not refer to the internal state of negotiating agents. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

AB  - In this paper we investigate the interaction between emotional and non-emotional aspects of persuasion dialogues, from the viewpoint of both the system (the Persuader), when reasoning on the persuasion attempt, and the user (the Receiver), when reacting to it. We are working on an Embodied Conversational Agent (ECA) which applies natural argumentation techniques to persuade users to improve their behaviour in the healthy eating domain. The ECA observes the user's attitude during the dialogue, so as to select an appropriate persuasion strategy or to respond intelligently to user's reactions to suggestions received. We grounded our work on the analysis of two corpora: a corpus of 'natural' persuasion examples and a corpus of user's reactions to persuasion attempts. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - People consider other people who resemble them to be more persuasive. Users may consider embodied conversational agents, or ECAs, to be more persuasive if the agents resemble them. In an experimental study, we found that users rated the persuasiveness of agents that resemble them higher than other agents. However, actual advice-taking diverged from this pattern; when users created the agents, users changed their choices less when interacting with the agents that resembled them. We conducted a follow-up study and found that resemblance and self-esteem affect interactions with agents that resemble users. We discuss the use of self-report and behavioral data in evaluations of agent interfaces and how agents that resemble users might foster particular social interactions with a system. We suggest that agents that resemble users may be more persuasive in advising users about their actions and decisions. © 2007 ACM.

AB  - Different approaches have investigated the syntax and semantics of agent communication languages. However, these approaches have not indicated how agents should dynamically use communications. Instead of filling this pragmatics gap, most approaches have mainly focused on the 'structure' of dialogues even though developers are more interested in agents' capabilities of having 'useful' automated conversations with respect to their goals rather than in their abilities to structure dialogues. This led us to work on a theory of the use of conversations between agents. In this paper, we propose a pragmatics theory which extends and adapts the cognitive dissonance theory (a major theory of social psychology) to multi-agent systems by unifying it with the theory of coherence in thought and action that issues from computational philosophy of mind. Precisely, we show how this theory allows us to provide generic conceptual tools for the automation of both agent communicational behavior and attitude change processes. This new motivational model is formulated in terms of constraints and elements of cognition and allows us to define cognitive incoherences and dialogue utility measures. We show how these measures could be used to solve common problems and answer some critical questions concerning agent communication frameworks use. Finally, our exploration in applying the cognitive coherence pragmatics theory as a new communication layer over classical BDI agents is presented. It relies on our dialogue games based agent communication language (DIAGAL) and our dialogue games simulator toolbox (DGS). The resulting framework provides the necessary theoretical and practical elements for implementing our theory. In doing so, it brings in a general scheme for automatizing agents' communicational behavior as it is exemplified in this article. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we explore and contrast different forms of dispute representation from the present and past literature. In particular, we examine the Zeno Framework, which represents disputes as dialectical trees, and compare this to other abstract systems for argument representation.We discuss the merits of each method and show how the example argument first represented in Zeno can be transformed into a more concise representation whilst retaining its desirable features. ©2006 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - New persuasive technologies often make the mistake of touting how new and different they are from anything that came before. What they should really be trying to do is mask any behavior change by making their interface and interactions as familiar and mundane as possible. This lesson is illustrated in a case study of the Nike + iPod, a revolutionary device that pretends to be just a better way to go for a run while listening to music. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - A relevant issue in the domain of natural argumentation and persuasion is the interaction (synergic or conflicting) between "rational" or "cognitive" modes of persuasion and "irrational" or "emotional" ones. This work provides a model of general persuasion and emotional persuasion. We examine two basic modes for appealing to emotions, arguing that emotional persuasion does not necessarily coincide with irrational persuasion, and showing how the appeal to emotions is grounded on the strict and manifold relationship between emotions and goals, which is, so to say, "exploited" by a persuader. We describe various persuasion strategies, propose a method to formalize and represent them as oriented graphs, and show how emotional and non-emotional strategies (and also emotional and non-emotional components in the same strategy) may interact with and strengthen each other. Finally, we address the role of uncertainty in persuasion strategies and show how it can be represented in persuasion graphs.

AB  - We advance a model to express the preconditions for engaging in dialogues in terms of the agents' mental attitudes, in a defeasible logic context (beliefs are divided into strict and defeasible ones). Then, we give a protocol for the persuasion dialogue between two agents, which provides the means of identifying both false premises and logical fallacies. Communicative acts are organized in a hierarchy, and relations between speech acts and social commitments are expressed via policies involving operations on social commitments. Including commitments renders an observable behaviour of the communicating agents. © 2006 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We present a new hybrid system that merges Fuzzy Logic with Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBN's): the Fuzzy Hidden Markov Predictor. It is a modification of the Hidden Markov Model, a particular case of DBN's, in order to enable it to predict continuous values of a time series. A DBN is a Bayesian Network that represents a temporal probability model. This hybrid system is applied to the task of monthly electric load single-step forecasting and successfully compared with three regression-by-discretization systems, two fuzzy hybrid systems, two Kalman Filter Models, and Box-Jenkins and Winters exponential smoothing. The employed time series present a sudden significant changing behavior at their last years, as it occurs in an energy rationing.

AB  - We are currently developing a digital positive psycho-therapy intervention. The intervention will be presented at the 3rd International Conference on Persuasive Technology 2008. By means of installing positive emotions, digital positive psycho-therapy may help prevent ego-depletion and hence increase the chances for successful self-regulation. This may turn out to be an important component in many health behaviour interventions. The current paper discusses some basic insights regarding how digital psychotherapy interventions can be designed and why they hold the potential to make a valuable contribution. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We performed an empirical study exploring people's interactions with an embodied conversational agent (ECA) while performing two tasks. Conditions varied with respect to 1) whether participants were allowed to choose an agent and its characteristics and 2) the putative quality or appropriateness of the agent for the tasks. For both tasks, selection combined with the illusion of further customization significantly improved participants' overall subjective impressions of the ECAs while putative quality had little or no effect. Additionally, performance data revealed that the ECA's motivation and persuasion effects were significantly enhanced when participants chose agents to use. We found that user expectations about and perceptions of the interaction between themselves and an ECA depended very much on the individual's preconceived notions and preferences of various ECA characteristics and might deviate greatly from the models that ECA designers intend to portray.

AB  - The aim of this study was to empirically evaluate an embodied conversational agent called GRETA in an effort to answer two main questions: (1) What are the benefits (and costs) of presenting information via an animated agent, with certain characteristics, in a 'persuasion' task, compared to other forms of display? (2) How important is it that emotional expressions are added in a way that is consistent with the content of the message, in animated agents? To address these questions, a positively framed healthy eating message was created which was variously presented via GRETA, a matched human actor, GRETA's voice only (no face) or as text only. Furthermore, versions of GRETA were created which displayed additional emotional facial expressions in a way that was either consistent or inconsistent with the content of the message. Overall, it was found that although GRETA received significantly higher ratings for helpfulness and likability, presenting the message via GRETA led to the poorest memory performance among users. Importantly, however, when GRETA's additional emotional expressions were consistent with the content of the verbal message, the negative effect on memory performance disappeared. Overall, the findings point to the importance of achieving consistency in animated agents. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this paper we attempt to give an account of reasoning with legal cases contextualised within a general theory of persuasion in practical reasoning. We begin by presenting our general theory, concentrating on the variety of ways in which a particular position can be attacked. We then apply our theory to the legal domain, illustrating our approach by a case study based on the well known CATO system. From this we conclude that it is possible to see reasoning with legal cases as a particular instantiation of our general theory. We identify some points of interest for discussion, and conclude by stating our intended directions for future work.

AB  - This article reviews formal systems that regulate persuasion dialogues. In such dialogues two or more participants aim to resolve a difference of opinion, each trying to persuade the other participants to adopt their point of view. Systems for persuasion dialogue have found application in various fields of computer science, such as non-monotonic logic, artificial intelligence and law, multi-agent systems, intelligent tutoring and computer-supported collaborative argumentation. Taking a game-theoretic view on dialogue systems, this review proposes a formal specification of the main elements of dialogue systems for persuasion and then uses it to critically review some of the main formal systems for persuasion. The focus of this review will be on regulating the interaction between agents rather than on the design and behaviour of individual agents within a dialogue. © 2006, Cambridge University Press.

AB  - The extensive use of computer games have been suggested to induce behavioural differences in the players as a result of neuroplasticity. Such changes, if present, suggests that computer games may be ideally suited as teaching tools for students having grown up with this technology. Using computer games extensively in the education system would in turn increase the gaming exposure significantly, even further accentuating any such neuroplastically mediated behavioural changes. To obtain information on possible changes in student behaviour patterns in key areas, an empirical study was conducted. Students participating in a test project extensively using computer games as teaching tools, were interviewed about both games related and other key behaviours. Results show some changed behaviours in the studied areas, such as decreased television watching habits and a shift from FPS to MMORPG as favourite game genre. While being consistent with computer games being able to induce behavioural changes through neuroplasticity, other factors may also have contributed in the studied case, and more research is needed. © The University of Wolverhampton, UK.

AB  - Lennart Åqvist (1992) proposed a logical theory of legal evidence, based on the Bolding-Ekelöf of degrees of evidential strength. This paper reformulates Åqvist's model in terms of the probabilistic version of the kappa calculus. Proving its acceptability in the legal context is beyond the present scope, but the epistemological debate about Bayesian Law is clearly relevant. While the present model is a possible link to that line of inquiry, we offer some considerations about the broader picture of the potential of AI & Law in the evidentiary context. Whereas probabilistic reasoning is well-researched in AI, calculations about the threshold of persuasion in litigation, whatever their value, are just the tip of the iceberg. The bulk of the modeling desiderata is arguably elsewhere, if one is to ideally make the most of AI's distinctive contribution as envisaged for legal evidence research.

AB  - There is a growing need for automated systems that can interview patients and consumers about their health and provide health education and behavior change interventions using natural language dialog. A number of these health dialog systems have been developed over the last two decades, many of which have been formally evaluated in clinical trials and shown to be effective. This article provides an overview of the theories, technologies and methodologies that are used in the construction and evaluation of these systems, along with a description of many of the systems developed and tested to date. The strengths and weaknesses of these approaches are also discussed, and the needs for future work in the field are delineated. © 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Northern Virginia Transportation Commission conducted a study to inventory and review transit-related intelligent transportation system (ITS) projects in the region, evaluate approaches to performance measurement, research the benefits associated with these projects, and establish an ongoing performance monitoring process. The project included interviews with transit managers and vendors and an intercept-mail-back survey of Northern Virginia transit riders. Results of the survey conducted in April 2003 are summarized. Surveys were distributed to more than 14,000 Northern Virginia transit riders at several large transit stations over the course of several week-days. Approximately 16% of the transit riders who received the questionnaire responded. Specifically, the survey instrument addressed demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, use of computers and the Internet, attitudes toward the current use of technology on transit, the importance of various technology uses, behavior changes as a result of transit ITS, familiarity with and frequency of use of various ITS applications in Northern Virginia, and usefulness and ease of use of ITS applications. Overall, survey respondents were widely supportive of the current use of technology on transit services in the region and, to a large extent, supportive of expanded technology use. The currently offered transit ITS applications have generally been viewed as useful, and the feeling that they are easy to use is widespread - an important accomplishment for the region.

AB  - In this paper we present an example of how principles of motivation can be designed into educational software to support students in achieving their goals. The objective of our software was to develop a reading habit in children between 8 and 11 years of age by motivating them to improve their reading and writing skills. By designing activities that integrate Gardner's Multiple Intelligence theory to our software, we were able to motivate children to read while acknowledging individual differences in their learning process. The results on presenting this software to different groups of children from the city and rural environments show how we were able to motivate students to read through the software itself and the activities it proposes, in a way that was credible and connected to the real-world environment children lived in. Our results show the importance of integrating principles from Persuasion such as similarity, tailoring and credibility, together with theories such as Gardner's in educational software to achieve motivation to read and write in children. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

AB  - This article first presents a series of concerns about the concept and field called persuasive technology, including an overly broad focus on technology instead of computation, and a focus on ends instead of means. As a possible solution, an alternative perspective is offered, dubbed fine processing, which is modeled after the concept of belles lettres. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - It is essential to think about education online as comprehensively as possible. Experience design offers designers of online courses a comprehensive model informed by research and development in a number of areas that can provide a foundation for the effective design of online experiences that are functional and purposeful - and also engaging, compelling, memorable, and enjoyable. Experience design is an ancient practice, going back to the earliest human impulse to develop rituals, ceremonies, drama, and even architecture. But the design of experiences has become much more pervasive during the twentieth century. Media has played a central role, including radio, television, multimedia, and virtual reality. But experience design is also informed by new ideas in economics, especially Pine and Gilmore's notion of the emerging experience economy. And it draws upon ideas from artificial intelligence, the psychology of optimal experiences, sociology, and other areas, including electronic commerce, persuasive, human- computer interface design, drama, and digital storytelling. This article discusses key concepts and theories from all of these areas and explains how they can be adapted to the design of online learning experiences.

AB  - To explore the issue of culture in persuasive technology, we identified strategies distinguishing individualist or collectivist audiences, and developed two versions of a prototype game. In this paper we report on a qualitative study of this game. The game concerned smoking cessation, and was set in a New Zealand context, where one version was designed for individualist New Zealand Europeans, and the other for collectivist New Zealand Māori. Our qualitative study involved people from each group playing each of the two games. Using a "think-aloud" protocol, we recorded player comments and reflections that show the effect of our design on their behaviour. The results of the study show the designs were interpreted differently according to the audiences playing them, and reveal detail about culture and persuasion. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Negotiation is essential in settings where agents have conflicting interests and a desire to cooperate. In many approaches, agents are assumed to have pre-set, fixed preferences, and complete awareness of the space of possible outcomes. Such strong conditions are often not satisfied. In this paper, we argue that since preferences are adopted to pursue particular goals, one agent may influence another agent's preferences by discussing the underlying motivations and interests behind adopting the associated goals. We identify concepts that seem essential for supporting this type of dialogue. In particular we demonstrate that arguing about beliefs needs to be complemented by arguing about goals, and we begin an analysis of dialogue moves involving goals.

AB  - Formal dialogue games studied by philosophers since the time of Aristotle have recently found application in Artificial Intelligence as the basis for protocols for interactions between autonomous software agents. For instance, game protocols have been proposed for agent dialogues involving team formation, persuasion, negotiation and deliberation. There is yet, however, no formal, mathematical theory of dialogue game protocols with which to compare two protocols or to study their formal properties. In this paper 1, we present preliminary work towards such a theory, in which we develop a geometric semantics for these protocols and, with it, define a notion of equivalence between two protocols. We then demonstrate an algebraic property of protocol equivalence, and use this to show the non-equivalence of two similar generic protocols. We also explore the relationship between finite and infinite dialogues, motivated by the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games of model theory. Our results have implications for the design and evaluation of agent dialogue-game protocols. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B. V.

AB  - Research on processing of negative and positive words shows that they are often processed in the same brain locations when arousal is high; that people quickly forget the source and the emotional content remains; and that people pay more attention to negative than to positive information. These factors suggest that information campaigns operating when arousal is low should use messages that are the longest of the shortest paths between "bad" and "good." Semantic network analysis of approximately 7,979 news stories about Al Qaeda in 2008 show "good" and "bad" to be closely linked with many links indicating that this enemy, its leaders, and its actions are "good." It is hypothesized that information campaign messages that incorporate a greater distance between "bad" and "good" will be more effective in reinforcing multiple perspectives that Al Qaeda is indeed bad not good. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - The purpose of the present research is to identify, analyze and simulate dynamics of interaction and conflicts among agents using drama theory, and to apply it in Citarum river basin problem. To accomplish the purpose, we first model the process in terms of drama theory that is combined with emotional state model (PAD). One of the reasons why we adopt drama theory is that it primarily focuses on dilemma or paradox arising from rational goal seeking behavior. It also provides us with rigorous analytical and computational tools of conflict analysis.Then, we propose a simulation model to describe both of dilemma of conflict, i.e., persuasion and rejection dilemma among the agents, and the dilemma of collaboration (trust dilemma) among the agents. Finally, we conduct agent-based simulation by using SOARS (Spot Oriented Agent Role Simulator) to obtain some fruitful suggestions for encouraging their collaboration. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Considering that neither captology nor agent-orientation, are applied in medical informatics, as they could be, the paper presents a broad-spectrum gene-ric architectural framework to support developing adaptive medical applications, based on synergistic correlation between persuasive interfaces and intelligent agents. Their main features are adapted for medical informatics. Lying on this groundwork, the design space for agent-oriented persuasive applications is defined and several guidelines for its main dimensions are given. The approach is instantiated through an agent-based test-bench application, having the purpose to persuade to quit smoking.

AB  - This paper studies Kairos, i.e. the opportune moment to persuade, through a smoking cessation experiment. We approached 101 people, comprising of 81 smokers and 20 non-smokers, on the streets of Palo Alto, California. The participants were shown five warning pictures related to the dangers of smoking as well as a control picture. The people rated each picture based upon how strongly they felt they were affected by the pictures. The results indicate that the opportune moment to show these pictures is not when the people already are smoking but rather much earlier. Quite interestingly, the affect of this intervention was stronger on women than men. The fact that the opportune moment seems to vary between individuals complicates the design of applications leveraging Kairos to a great extent. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - An abstract framework for formalising persuasion dialogues has recently been proposed. The framework provides for a range of speech acts, and protocols of varying levels of flexibility. However, the framework assumes the availability of preference information relevant to determining whether arguments moved in a dialogue defeat each other. However, preference information may only become available after the dialogue has terminated. Hence, in this paper, we describe dialogues conducted under the assumption of an attack relation that does not account for preferences. We then describe how the resultant dialogue graph can be pruned by a preference relation in order to determine whether the winner of the dialogue is still the winner given the newly available preference information. We also describe a class of protocols that account for subsequent pruning by a preference relation, and show that under a restriction on the pruning, if the player defending the dialogue's main topic is winning the dialogue, then (s)he remains the winner irrespective of the preference relation applied. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Computer modelling of personality and behaviour is becoming increasingly important in many fields of computer science and psychology. Personality and emotion-driven Believable Agents are needed in areas like human-machine interfaces, electronic advertising and, most notably, electronic entertainment. Computer models of personality can help explain personality by illustrating its underlying structure and dynamics. This work presents a neural network model of personality and personality change. The goals are to help understand personality and create more realistic and believable characters for interactive video games. The model is based largely on trait theories of personality. Behaviour in the model results from the interaction of three components: (1) personality-based predispositions for behaviour, (2) moods/emotions and (3) environmental situations. Personality develops gradually over time depending on the situations encountered. Modelling personality change produces interesting and believable virtual characters whose behaviours change in psychologically plausible ways. © 2005 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Virtual health counseling agents on mobile devices need to be able to interrupt their users when it is time for them to engage in healthy behaviors, such as scheduled medication taking or exercise. However, these real-time reminders often represent task interruptions for individuals who are engaged in work activities. This paper presents the results of a study which compares four strategies used by a virtual agent on a PDA for interrupting users at work to perform a healthy behavior. We find that, among several interruption coordination strategies previously explored in the HCI literature, empathie interruptions are superior overall in gaining both short-term compliance and self-reported desire to continue working with the agent.

AB  - Fundamental in engineering design is the notion that collaboration is useful to reduce total project development time and increase design quality. A critical element of collaborative design is the resolution of conflict situations that result naturally from the interaction of cooperating designers, particularly when they are widely dispersed. A multi-approach method for computer-supported resolution of conflict situations in collaborative facility design is introduced. The method is based on social sciences theories used to solve human conflicts. FDL-CR, an extension of the Facility Description Language (FDL) with conflict resolution capabilities provided by the new tool, is the major development in this research. It provides fast identification of the conflict situation, diagnostics of conflict parameters, access to the conflict information by all conflicting parties and mechanisms for conflict resolution. The usefulness of FDL-CR is evaluated with a design case study where a neural-fuzzy inference system is developed to validate the conflict resolution method through the confrontation of conflicting parties. Computer-supported confrontation of conflicting parties was effective when other approaches, such as third-party mediation and persuasion, failed to provide conflict resolution. The new tool is viewed as an essential component of virtual design and manufacturing, and in general e-work.

AB  - Persuasive dialogue systems that aim to change people's attitudes and behaviours have drawn much attention in recent years due to their great practical potential. Current systems rely heavily on argumentation and advice-giving to form their persuasive messages. Many findings in psychology, and some counselling intervention methods such as Motivational Interviewing (MI) dispute this confrontational approach. Our project sets out to investigate whether MI can provide an alternative way to develop a more effective system. In this paper, we discuss the limitations of the argumentation-based approach, review a number of argumentation-based systems, and present the results of an evaluation study which compares people's perception of the persuasibility of two argumentation-based dialogues and a MI-based counterpart. Our results show a higher perceived persuasiveness for the MI-based dialogue. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - We describe a general mechanism for adaptation in multiagent systems in which agents modify their behavior based on their memory of past events. These behavior changes can be elicited by environmental dynamics or arise as response to the actions of other agents. The agents use memory to estimate the global state of the system from individual observations and adjust their actions accordingly. We also present a mathematical model of the dynamics of collective behavior in such systems and apply it to study adaptive coalition formation in electronic marketplaces. In adaptive coalition formation, the agents are more likely to join smaller coalitions than larger ones while there are many small coalitions. The rationale behind this is that smaller coalitions are necessary to nucleate larger ones. The agents remember the sizes of coalition they encountered and use them to estimate the mean coalition size. They decide whether to join a new coalition based on how close its size is to the mean coalition size. We show that the adaptive system displays most of the features of the non-adaptive one, but results in better long term system performance.

AB  - We have implemented a conceptual software framework and a story-based game that facilitates generation of rich and vivid narratives in vast geographical areas. An important design challenge in the emergent research area of pervasive gaming is to provide believable environments where game content is matched to the landscape in an evocative and persuasive way. More specificly, our game is designed to generate such an environment tailored to a journey as experienced from the backseat of a car. Therefore, it continuously references common geographical objects, such as houses, forests and churches, in the vicinity within the story; it provides a sequential narrative that fit with the drive; it works over vast areas, and it is possible to interact with the game while looking out of the windows. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2006.

AB  - Models of persuasion, argument, and reasoning motivated by analogies from Law and legal process are now accepted formalisms supporting multi-agent discourse in applications such as contract negotiation and resolving disputed claims. A number of non-classical Logics and proof theories within these have been proposed specifically to deal with the special circumstances wherein propositional theories are not best suited to address modeling issues arising in legal contexts: e.g. exceptions and defaults are treated in a variety of so-called non-monotonic logics; similarly concepts of credulous, cautious and sceptical belief have been developed, partly to reflect differing forms of 'burden of proof' that may apply in various judicial contexts. Our concern in this paper is to consider one aspect of legal argument that appears to have been largely neglected in existing work concerning agent discourse protocols - particularly so in the arenas of persuasion and dispute resolution - the use of legitimate procedural devices to defer 'undesirable' conclusions being finalised and the deployment of such techniques in seeking to have a decision over-ruled. Motivating our study is the contention that individual agents within an 'agent society' could (be programmed to) act in a 'non-cooperative' manner: thus, contesting policies/decisions accepted by other agents in the 'society' in order to improve some national 'individual' utility. Using Dung's argumentation framework, we present various settings in which the use of 'legitimate delay' can be rigorously modeled, formulate some natural decision questions respecting the existence and utility of 'prevaricatory tactics', and, finally, illustrate within a greatly simplified schema, how carefully-chosen devices may greatly increase the length of an apparently 'straightforward' dispute.

AB  - Eating habits are influenced by emotional factors. Persuasion to change wrong habits should therefore act on the central and the peripheral route at the same time, by combining rational and emotional strategies appropriately. In this paper, we describe an ongoing research which is aimed at simulating persuasion dialogs in this domain. We describe how we collected and analyzed a corpus of messages and how we compared the persuasion strength of rational vs emotional, negatively vs positively framed discourses. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the knowledge representation methods that are suited to represent these strategies.

AB  - This paper presents a new behavior-based architecture for a mobile robot. The architecture coordinates behaviors based on a robot's internal condition and environment information. This approach combines the subsumption and schema-based approaches together with a unique feature called request or redundant mode. By monitoring a behavior's expected outcome, an unproductive behavior can request its redundant behavior to take over a task. On the other hand, when the requesting behavior can do the task again, it can take the task back. The results show that a system with the new architecture yields better performance than a system without it. Moreover, the new architecture can change behaviors' level and modes, add new behaviors, delete unused behaviors, and create new behaviors or tasks from existing behaviors at run-time, without reprogramming or restarting the entire system. © 2003 IEEE.

AB  - The realization of the ambient intelligence (AmI) vision will have a profound impact on our everyday lives and society. AmI applied in contexts like homes or public spaces will not only affect individual users but influence entire groups of users. The question is how we can apply such technologies to persuade groups and individual users. Our approach is to design AmI environments by borrowing a concept which works very well in biological and social systems: Collective Intelligence (CI). The intelligence of a group surpasses the individual intelligences and leads to improved problem solving capabilities of individuals and groups. From nature we borrow examples of cues in the environment to stimulate goal directed collective intelligence (perCues). The application of perCues in AmI environments helps to persuade users to reach a common goal like decreasing environmental pollution. Adopting CI for AmI we blaze a trail for the design of persuasive AmI environments. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

AB  - In many cases of disagreement, particularly in situations involving practical reasoning, it is impossible to demonstrate conclusively that either party is wrong. The role of argument in such cases is to persuade rather than to prove, demonstrate or refute. Following Perelman, we argue that persuasion in such cases relies on a recognition that the strength of an argument depends on the social values that it advances, and that whether the attack of one argument on another succeeds depends on the comparative strength of the values advanced by the arguments concerned. To model this we extend the standard notion of Argumentation Frameworks (AFs)to Value-based Argumentation Frameworks (VAFs). After defining VAFs we explore their properties, and show how they can provide a rational basis for the acceptance or rejection of arguments, even where this would appear to be a matter of choice in a standard AF. In particular we show that in a VAF certain arguments can be shown to be acceptable however the relative strengths of the values involved are assessed. This means that disputants can concur on the acceptance of arguments, even when they differ as to which values are more important, and hence that we can identify points for which persuasion should be possible. We illustrate the above using an example moral debate. We then show how factual considerations can be admitted to our framework and discuss the possibility of persuasion in the face of uncertainty and disagreement as to values.

AB  - In this paper we put forward a formal description of theories which can be used to record understanding of, and explain decisions in, case law domains. We believe that reasoning with cases involves all of theory construction, use and evaluation, and that awareness of the theory which provides a context for case based arguments is essential to understanding such arguments. Moreover, our account of these theories includes a systematic link between factors and values, which we believe is necessary to explain why some arguments prove to be more persuasive than others. We begin by formalising the various elements that the theories contain, and then provide a set of theory constructors which allow theories to built up from the background of decided cases. We show how such theories can be used to explain decisions on particular cases. We discuss how theories can be compared and evaluated. We then show how the argument moves of HYPO and CATO can be understood in terms of our framework. We conclude with a brief discussion of an implementation of the framework, and a summary of the major features of our approach. Copyright 2001 ACM.

AB  - Social persuasion abounds in human-human interactions. Attitudes and behaviors of people are invariably influenced by the attitudes and behaviors of other people as well as our social roles/relationships toward them. In the pedagogic scene, the relationship between teacher and learner produces one of the most typical interactions, in which the teacher makes the learner spontaneously study what he/she teaches. This study is an attempt to elucidate the nature and effectiveness of social persuasion in human-computer interaction environments. We focus on the social dynamics of multi-party interactions that involve both human-agent and inter-agent interactions. An experiment is conducted in a virtual web-instruction setting employing two types of agents: conductor agents who accompany and guide each learner throughout his/her learning sessions, and domain-expert agents who provide explanations and instructions for each stage of the instructional materials. In this experiment, subjects are assigned two experimental conditions: the authorized condition, in which an agent respectfully interacts with another agent, and the non-authorized condition, in which an agent carelessly interacts with another agent. The results indicate performance improvements in the authorized condition of inter-agent interactions. An analysis is given from the perspective of the transfer of authority from inter-agent to human-agent interactions based on social conformity. We argue for pedagogic advantages of social dynamics created by multiple animated character agents.

AB  - Current user interfaces for automated patient and consumer health care systems can be improved by leveraging the results of several decades of research into effective patient-provider communication skills. A research project is presented in which several such "relational" skills - including empathy, social dialogue, nonverbal immediacy behaviors, and other behaviors to build and maintain good working relationships over multiple interactions - are explicitly designed into a computer interface within the context of a longitudinal health behavior change intervention for physical activity adoption. Results of a comparison among 33 subjects interacting near-daily with the relational system and 27 interacting near-daily with an identical system with the relational behaviors ablated, each for 30 days indicate, that the use of relational behaviors by the system significantly increases working alliance and desire to continue working with the system. Comparison of the above groups to another group of 31 subjects interacting with a control system near-daily for 30 days also indicated a significant increase in proactive viewing of health information. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Appropriately designed web services and ambient interfaces can work in concert to aid people saving energy in the home. Boel is an experimental social web service that presents daily consumption figures to home owners and neighbors to promote joint savings and foster competitive energy saving behaviors. Moreover, the service includes a Zigbee-enabled ambient lamp that provides feedback on the energy consumption in the household and these interfaces are installed so that the neighbors can observe each others energy status. The goal of the design was to promote daily awareness of the home's energy consumption and to promote saving behaviors by means of a competitive scheme and peer-pressure. In this paper, we present the design and rationale of this web service and its ambient interface as well as its pros and cons. © ICT&S Center, University of Salzburg.

AB  - Results point to perceived store benevolence and staff effectiveness as important spillover effects in the use of persuasive technologies in the retail setting. The comparison of customer exit interviews, conducted at control stores and at test stores, before and after the introduction of video displays playing advertising and promotion messages, documented that customers noticed the displays, recalled the content and were influenced toward the desired effect. Additionally, significant attitudinal differences related to customer perception of staff and stores were also noted. Product marketers, brand managers, retailers, and academicians can draw actionable insights for the use of persuasive technologies by understanding the impact of persuasive technologies on relational exchanges. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - A routine work requires few skills, so employees can be skilled easily. Therefore, the productivity and the quality of work greatly depend on employees' work motivation. However, as a routine work is often not interesting to almost all employees originally, a method for promoting and keeping employees' work motivation is required for keeping or increasing the productivity and the quality of work. Therefore, the objective of this study is to develop an education method for promoting employees' work motivation in a routine work especially with an affective interface and applying the persuasion technique.

AB  - We sketch a variant of the KGP agent model tailored to support service composition in service-oriented architectures. This allows to handle: user requirements, abstract and concrete workflows, possibly with annotations, inter-agent communication for supporting negotiation and persuasion, consultation of registries. We identify argumentation as core for Service-Oriented Architectures, and ground our work in the context of three concrete scenarios: e-procurement, earth observation, and business migration.

AB  - In this ever-changing world, the function of information technology (IT) department is becoming increasingly important. The objective of this study is to construct an approach based on balanced scorecard (BSC) and artificial neural network (ANN) for evaluating an IT department in the manufacturing industry. A novel hybrid particle swarm optimization (HPSO)-based learning method is utilized in the ANN. The reliability of the ANN model is tested by a practical example. The results show that the ANN model learned by HPSO algorithm has relative high accuracy and is better than the back propagation algorithm. The empirical findings suggest that the ANNs model can be a persuasive analytical tool for the performance evaluation of the IT department. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Organizing data into hierarchies is natural for humans. However, there is little work in machine learning that explores human-machine mixed-initiative approaches to organizing data into hierarchical clusters. In this paper we consider mixed-initiative clustering of a user's email, in which the machine produces (initial and re-trained) hierarchical clusterings of email, and the user iteratively reviews and edits the hierarchical clustering, providing constraints on the next iteration of clustering. Key challenges include (a) determining types of feedback that users will find natural to provide, (b) developing hierarchical clustering and retraining algorithms capable of accepting these types of user feedback, (c) determining the correspondence between two hierarchical structures, and (d) understanding how user behavior changes during a single feedback session and designing machine strategies that change with the user. Preliminary experimental results of two cases shows that under ideal conditions, this mixed-initiative approach requires only 6 minutes of user effort to achieve email clusterings comparable to those requiring 13 to 15 minutes of manual editing efforts.

AB  - Analogical reasoning has long been an important tool in the production of scientific knowledge, yet many scientists remain hesitant to fully endorse (or even admit) its use. As the teachers of scientific and technical writers, we have an opportunity and responsibility to teach them to use analogy without their writing becoming “overly inductive,” as Aristotle warned. To that end, I here offer an analysis of an example of the effective use of analogy in Rodney Brooks's “Intelligence Without Representation.” In this article, Brooks provides a model for incorporating these tools into an argument by building four of them into an enthymeme that clearly organizes his argument. This combination of inductive and deductive reasoning helped the article become a very influential piece of scholarship in artificial intelligence research, and it can help our students learn to use analogy in their own writing. Every one who effects persuasion through proof does in fact use either enthymemes or examples: there is no other way. (Aristotle, 1984b, p. 26). © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In recent year, credit card has been one of the most attractive financial products all over the world. The magnificent increase in credit card market leads card issuers put more attentions on how to understand their customers. This research proposes a detection model to identify usage behavior change patterns of credit card customers in two time periods. In the model, customer profiles and purchase transactions of two time periods are retrieved from card issuer databases. Then, a usage behavior rule set for each time period is generated using Apriori association rule algorithm. Finally, significant usage behavior change patterns are identified through rule set comparison using defined similarity and difference measures. The proposed model has been successfully implemented using real credit card data provided by a commercial bank in Taiwan. Several marketing strategies are suggested according the analysis finding. With the proposed model, card issuers can detect critical usage behavior changes and allocate their limited resource to establish suitable marketing strategy for their customers.

AB  - The Turing Test, originally proposed as a simple operational definition of intelligence, has now been with us for exactly half a century. It is safe to say that no other single article in computer science, and few other articles in science in general, have generated so much discussion. The present article chronicles the comments and controversy surrounding Turing's classic article from its publication to the present. The changing perception of the Turing Test over the last 50 years has paralleled the changing attitudes in the scientific community towards artificial intelligence: from the unbridled optimism of 1960s to the current realization of the immense difficulties that still lie ahead. I conclude with the prediction that the Turing Test will remain important, not only as a landmark in the history of the development of intelligent machines, but also with real relevance to future generations of people living in a world in which the cognitive capacities of machines will be vastly greater than they are now. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - The negotiation in MAS is usually comprised of multiple issues, which causes the extremely huge problem space. Classical negotiation methods based on game theory obtain the optimal resolution through thorough search of the space, which are consequently not suitable for multi-issue negotiation. In addition, those methods consider little about the change of the agents' preference, so that with the incomplete and incorrect information, the optimal resolution is not rational. A persuasive multi-agent multi-issue negotiation method is illustrated, which is underpinned by belief revision logic. These belief-based negotiation agents are able to persuade their opponents to change their position. Preliminary experiments show that the belief-based negotiation agents can adapt to the changing environment and reach the agreement more quickly and correctly than those based on the classical negotiation model under time pressure.

AB  - This demonstration describes the generation of ambient and latent NPC behavior scripts using generative behavior patterns with ScriptEase. Our behavior model supports behavior roles, a powerful mechanism that allows an NPC to change behavior sets during the story. Our motivation model for selecting ambient behaviors generates more realistic NPC behaviors and our novel collaboration protocol simplifies and extends the NPCs' collaborations with a broader range of NPCs. We demonstrate motivational ambient and latent behaviors for a guard NPC in a custom Neverwinter Nights game module. With ScriptEase, game authors can use, adapt, and create behavior patterns that generate complex, versatile, and engaging NPC behaviors.

AB  - Scholars in the sociology of science have long been interested in the factors that cause an established academic field to be prestigious, as well as in the benefits that accrue from having prestige. But they have shown remarkably little interest in systematic investigation of the factors that allow an academic field to emerge at all. In this paper, we model the ascendance of a new academic field as a successful social movement, consisting of three major elements: differentiation, mobilization, and legitimacy-building. For a new field to emerge, the aspiring community must differentiate itself from other existing fields, making claims about how a class of important problems cannot be solved by these status quo entities. Second, there must be a mobilization of resources; the elements of collective action - political opportunity structure, a bounded set of shared interests, and social infrastructure - must be in place or put in place. Third, the aspiring community must build legitimacy in the eyes of the academic establishment, both by intellectual persuasion as well as by adherence to the norms, styles, and standards of adjacent established fields. We illustrate each element of our model by applying it to the published histories of four academic fields: agricultural chemistry, artificial intelligence, molecular biology, and radio astronomy. And we apply the model comprehensively to explain the rise of a specific field within the administrative sciences: strategic management.

AB  - This investigation joins recent research on problems with ambiguity in two fields, argumentation and computing. In argumentation, there is a concern with fallacies arising from ambiguity, including equivocation and amphiboly. In computing, the development of agent communication languages is based on conversation policies that make it possible to have information exchanges on the internet, as well as other forms of dialogue like persuasion and negotiation, in which ambiguity is a problem. Because it is not possible to sharply differentiate between problems arising from ambiguity and those arising from vagueness, obscurity and indeterminacy, some study of the latter is included. The semantic web is based on what are called ontologies, or systems of classification of concepts, shown to be useful tools for dealing with these problems. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - In the field of natural language dialogue, a new trend is exploring persuasive argumentation theories. Applying these theories to human-computer dialogue management could lead to a more comfortable experience for the user and give way to new applications. In this paper, we study the different aspects of persuasive communication needed for health-care advising and how to implement them to produce efficient, computer directed persuasion. Our opinion is that a persuasive dialogue will have to combine the current logical approach to persuasion with novel emotional cues to render the dialogue more comfortable to the user.

AB  - Previous research demonstrated social influence resulting from mimicry (the chameleon effect); a confederate who mimicked participants was more highly regarded than a confederate who did not, despite the fact that participants did not explicitly notice the mimicry. In the current study, participants interacted with an embodied artificial intelligence agent in immersive virtual reality. The agent either mimicked a participant's head movements at a 4-s delay or utilized prerecorded movements of another participant as it verbally presented an argument. Mimicking agents were more persuasive and received more positive trait ratings than nonmimickers, despite participants' inability to explicitly detect the mimicry. These data are uniquely powerful because they demonstrate the ability to use automatic, indiscriminate mimicking (i.e., a computer algorithm blindly applied to all movements) to gain social influence. Furthermore, this is the first study to demonstrate social influence effects with a nonhuman, nonverbal mimicker. Copyright © 2005 American Psychological Society.

AB  - Adapting training methods to specific teacher traits to best facilitate the training effects for preservice teachers is an important, yet neglected, topic in aptitude-treatment interaction research. This study investigated interactions between four personal traits (CT-dispositions, thinking styles, CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence) and two designed treatments on preservice teachers' behavior change during a computer-simulated teaching experience. One hundred and seventy-eight preservice teachers participated in this study. The CS-TGCTS simulation program was employed to measure the preservice teachers' actual use of effective teacher behaviors, as well as the four targeted personal traits which were measured by three Likert-scale inventories and one multiple-choice test. The results suggest that preservice teachers with high levels of CT-dispositions, CT-skills, and intrapersonal intelligence - as well as those with judicial or legislative thinking styles - are mindful, analytical, and reflective in their teaching practices and therefore more likely to continually improve their teaching skills. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Persuasion is one of the main types of dialogs encountered in everyday life. The basic idea behind a persuasion is that two (or more) agents disagree on a state of affairs, and each one tries to persuade the other to change his mind. For that purpose, agents exchange arguments of different strengths. Several systems, grounded on argumentation theory, have been proposed in the literature for modeling persuasion dialogs. These systems have studied more or less deeply the different protocols required for this kind of dialogs, and have investigated different termination criteria. However, nothing is said about the properties of the generated dialogs, nor on the behavior of the interacting agents. Besides, analyzing dialogs is a usual task in everyday life. For instance, political debates are generally deeply dissected. In this paper we define measures for analyzing dialogs from the point of view of an external agent. In particular, three kinds of measures are proposed: i) measures of the quality of the exchanged arguments in terms of their strengths, ii) measures of the behavior of each participating agent in terms of its coherence, its aggressiveness in the dialog, and finally in terms of the novelty of its arguments, iii) measures of the quality of the dialog itself in terms of the relevance and usefulness of its moves. © 2008 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - This paper analyses the phenomenon of a shift of the burden of proof in legal persuasion dialogues. Some sample dialogues are analysed of types of situations where such a shift may occur, viz. reasoning with defeasible rules, reasoning with argumentation schemes and reasoning with mere presumptions. It is argued that whether a shift in the burden of proof occurs can itself become the subject of dispute and it is shown how a dialogue game protocol for persuasion can be extended to let it regulate persuasion dialogues about the burden of proof. It is also shown that dialogues about the burden of proof are often implicitly about the precise form of the rules used in an argument. Copyright 2005 ACM.

AB  - Gas chromatography is frequently used to fingerprint fuel spills, with the gas chromatograms of the spill sample and the different candidate fuels compared visually in order to seek a best match. However, visual analysis of gas chromatograms is subjective and is not always persuasive in a court of law. Pattern recognition methods offer a better approach to the problem of matching gas chromatograms of weathered fuels. Pattern recognition methods involve less subjectivity in the interpretation of the data and are capable of identifying fingerprint patterns within gas chromatographic (GC) data characteristic of fuel-type, even if the fuel samples comprising the training set have been subjected to a variety of conditions. In this paper, we report on the development of a genetic algorithm (GA) for pattern recognition analysis of GC fuel spill data. The pattern recognition GA incorporates aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary computations to yield a "smart" one-pass procedure for feature selection. Its efficacy is demonstrated by way of two studies recently completed in our laboratory on fuel spill identification. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - This paper discusses what makes technology persuasive and what kind of technology is considered interesting among the elderly. Also, factors contributing to the choice between appliances are presented. For acquisition of information several qualitative methods were used. Among the factors making technology interesting were the support of safety, independency, memory and health, and bringing easiness and comfort to everyday life without forgetting expressing oneself and social issues. The elderly had several opinions on the usability. The study revealed some factors which were influencing the interest despite the qualities of an appliance. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Dialogue protocols have been the subject of considerable attention with respect to their potential applications in multiagent system environments. Formalisations of such protocols define classes of dialogue locutions, concepts of a dialogue state, and rules under which a dialogue proceeds. One important consideration in implementing a protocol concerns the criteria an agent should apply in choosing which utterance will constitute its next contribution to a discussion in progress: ideally, an agent should select a locution that (by some measure) "optimises" the outcome. The precise interpretation of 'optimise' is, however, something that may vary greatly depending on the nature and intent of a dialogue area. If we consider 'persuasion' protocols, where one agent's intention is to convince others of the validity or invalidity of a specific proposition, then optimality might be regarded in the sense of "choice of locution that results in a 'minimal length' debate": thus the agent defending a hypothesis tries to select utterances that will convince other participants of the validity of this hypothesis after 'as few locutions as possible'. We present a formal setting for considering the problem of deciding if a particular utterance in the context of a persuasion dialogue is optimal in this sense. We show that, in general, this decision problem is both NP-hard and CO-NP-hard.

In this paper, we consider one of these - letters between citizens and representatives - and explore the application of a well-known model of dialogue types to these. We provide a method to give these types a precise characterization in terms of the initial beliefs and desires of the participants, and then explore one type, persuasion dialogues. This work commences the formal modeling of citizen-representative interactions necessary for a fully electronic democracy. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2003.

AB  - Persuasive conversational agents persuade users to change their attitudes or behaviors through conversation and are expected to be applied as virtual sales-clerks in e-shopping sites. Developing such an agent requires a conversation model that identifies the most appropriate responses to the user's inputs. To create such a model, we propose the approach of combining a learning agent with the Wizard of Oz method; in this approach, a person (called the Wizard) talks to the user pretending to be the agent. The agent learns from the conversations between the Wizard and the user and constructs its own conversation model. In this approach, the Wizard has to reply to most of the user's inputs at the beginning, but the burden gradually falls because the agent learns how to reply as the conversation model grows. Every persuasive conversation has the goal of persuading the user and ends with success or failure. We introduce a goal-oriented conversation model that can represent the success probability of persuasion and a learning method to update the model depending on the success/failure of the persuasive conversation. We introduce a learning persuasive agent that implements the conversation model and the learning method and evaluate it in the situation wherein the agent persuades users to choose one type of digital camera over another. The agent could succeed in reducing the Wizard's inputs by 48%, and, more interestingly, succeeded in persuading 2 users without any help from the Wizard. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In this presentation, I demonstrate how many of the technologies used in movie special effects and games have been successfully used in health education and behavior change interventions. Computer-animated health counselors simulate human face-to-face dialogue as a computer interface medium, including not only verbal behavior but nonverbal conversational behavior such as hand gesture, body posture shifts, and facial display of emotion. This technology has now been successfully used in a wide range of health interventions for education and counseling of patients and consumers, including applications in physical activity promotion, medication adherence, and hospital discharge. These automated counselors have been deployed on home computers, hospital-based touch screen kiosks, and mobile devices with integrated health behavior sensing capability. Development of these agents is an interdisciplinary endeavor spanning the fields of character modeling and animation, computational linguistics, artificial intelligence, health communication and behavioral medicine. I will give demonstrations of several fielded systems, describe the technologies and methodologies underlying their development, and present results from five randomized controlled trials that have been completed or are in progress.

AB  - In spite of differences in the Artificial intelligence definitions, those definitions agree with the fact that the A.I aim is to transfer the intelligent human behavior to the computer. This do necessary the modeling of the intelligent human behavior. However, the modeling task is not at all evident. When the considered application is related to the human intuition (i.e knowledge acquisition and use), the modeling process move away from formal, and depends mainly on the expert perception of the human comportment. Note that the expert perception might be incomplete, and depends on research results on each domain related to the human cognition. In spite of that, many implemented models gave satisfactory results. Most persuasive example are neural networks. In this paper, we will present a simple model oriented to knowledge acquiring and use; we mean by use, the task commonly called "inference". We based our model on some human cognition behaviors observed through some experimentations. The main remarkable qualities of our model are the high level of abstraction, the flexibility to addition, suppression and substitution, the graphical simple representation, and the tolerance to errors which can occur during knowledge acquisition. We have already implemented the model in various applications. The one we are presnenting in this paper is the basket analysis.

AB  - Text passwords are the ubiquitous method of authentication, used by most people for most online services. Many people choose weak passwords that are vulnerable to attackers who simply guess all the passwords within the most probable password spaces. This paper describes a lightweight password creation mechanism that uses Persuasive Technology to influence users to create stronger passwords. Results from a pilot study show that our Persuasive Text Passwords (PTP) prototype system successfully influenced users to create and remember more secure passwords. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim---either explicitly or implicitly---at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Cueing strategies, such as real-time reminders, are among the most effective methods of persuading individuals to perform healthy behaviors such as taking their medication and exercising. However, these reminders often represent a task interruption for users who are engaged in work activities. This paper presents the results of a study which explores strategies for interrupting users at work to perform a healthy behavior, in which the primary outcome of interest is long-term adherence to a desired health behavior change regimen. We find that the degree of perceived politeness of interruptions is positively correlated with predicted long-term adherence, but negatively correlated with short-term compliance. We also find that, among several interruption coordination strategies previously explored in the literature, empathic interruptions are superior overall in gaining both short-term compliance and long-term adherence. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2007.

AB  - The most enduring learning experiences are those that change attitudes. When I was invited to write an introduction to this part of the book I hesitated for a moment. Let me explain why. While long advocating the reuse of learning dialogues as a learning resource, I have nevertheless thought of myself as a sceptic on the topic of learning objects. My attitude had been rooted in the belief that it is fundamentally misguided to think of learning as having anything much to do with content. As a good constructivist I knew that many had been tempted away from the path of true pedagogy by the seductive vision of automated instruction. For many years the discipline of artificial intelligence offered the prospect of computer-generated courses, with the software capable of understanding enough about both the subject matter and the individual learner to be able to conduct an automated tutorial. Subject matter would be automatically selected from a knowledge base and offered to the learner in a way that filled in the identified gaps in the learner’s knowledge. It had seemed to me that the idea of learning objects that could be automatically combined into a course, tailored for an individual learner, was a re-emergence of that flawed vision. Admittedly the idea was more modest in its goals than that of building full-blown intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). © Allison Littlejohn and the individual contributors, 2004.

AB  - The authors describe the implementation of advanced nonlinear control systems by combining recent advances in nonlinear control system synthesis with a rule-based system approach to real-time control. The basic idea is that a nonlinear plant to be controlled could be quite sensitive to both operating point and input amplitude, so that the best control system performance is obtained with a nonlinear controller that is returned or resynthesized whenever the operating point changes significantly in the sense that the nonlinear control system input/output behavior changes substantially in an undesirable way. The control system thus obtained is hierarchically organized, with a standard reprogrammable controller under the direction of a rule-based system.

AB  - Generating expressions which communicate information already known to the hearer, building enthymematic arguments, and characterising refutations all pose significant problems to traditional natural language generation techniques. After exploring these problems, an approach is proposed which through its employment of a notion of saliency handles them cleanly, and offers support for further features including clue word generation. It is argued that propositional salience and its interaction with intentional, attentional, epistemic and structural components of a text generation system have a key role to play in the design and realisation of persuasive text.

AB  - A frequently observed difficulty in the application of genetic algorithms to the domain of optimization arises from premature convergence. In order to preserve genotype diversity we develop a new model of auto-adaptive behavior for individuals. In this model a population member is an active individual that assumes social-like behavior patterns. Different individuals living in the same population can assume different patterns. By moving in a hierarchy of “social states” individuals change their behavior. Changes of social state are controlled by arguments of plausibility. These arguments are implemented as a rule set for a massively-parallel genetic algorithm. Computational experiments on 12 large-scale job shop benchmark problems show that the results of the new approach dominate the ordinary genetic algorithm significantly. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1994.

AB  - This paper proposes that a Japanese-style organization may be well understood when we focus on the personality of its members. This observation is derived from our simulation based on a personalistic agent model. Our computer simulations are designed to explore the organizational behavior related to organizational rigidity and an organization's reorganizing processes based on a personality model of organizational members. We define the individual personality of members in our model based on Karson and O'Dell's psychological theory. The personality of members has three parameters in our model: task stickiness, interpersonal emotion, and conservativeness. The rigidity of the organization perceived by agents is formulated in our model as the organization's performance, its adaptability to the environment, and incredibility for information. We formulate the reorganization based on attitude change theory and the Minsky's difference engine model. Our simulation has led us to derive two implications concerning Japanese-style organizations. First, the cliques brought by the interpersonal emotion of agents may be considered to generate the peculiar communication style similar to that of Japanese-style organizations such as Keiretsu. Second, the task stickiness and the attitude change of agents develop the specialization-structuralization chain. The chain can be considered to give Japanese-style organizations an advantage over U.S. or European organizations in adapting to different environments.

AB  - In 1976, Congress created the National Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) to examine the implications of computer and other information technologies and to advise Congress on whether it would be wise to assimilate these new technologies into the existing copyright regime. Ever since, a number of people have voiced criticisms of CONTU's recommendations, arguing for a modification of the current copyright regime or even a different legal structure for these issues. Although these critics have many different approaches, they share the fear that incorporating these technologies into the current copyright system will lead to overprotection. In this Article, Professor Miller examines these arguments and concludes that CONTU's recommendations were correct and that the current regime is flexible enough to address the critics' concerns. First, Professor Miller surveys the progress of the court decisions involving computer programs, and demonstrates that a set of coherent copyright principles is beginning to develop in this area. Next, Professor Miller discusses the newer phenomenon of artificial intelligence, and utilizes copyright principles that have developed in the areas of computer programs and databases to demonstrate that at its current stage of development, artificial intelligence does not pose any significant obstacles to copyright analysis. Finally, Professor Miller addresses the claim that it eventually will be impossible to assimilate computer-generated works into the copyright system because they may have no obvious human author, and concludes not only that the caselaw contains no persuasive objection to extending copyright protection to these works, but also that such an extension would fulfill the constitutional imperative of promoting progress in these areas.

AB  - Computational and mathematical organization theory is an interdisciplinary scientific area whose research members focus on developing and testing organizational theory using formal models. The community shares a theoretical view of organizations as collections of processes and intelligent adaptive agents that are task oriented, socially situated, technologically bound, and continuously changing. Behavior within the organization is seen to affect and be affected by the organization's, position in the external environment. The community also shares a methodological orientation toward the use of formal models for developing and testing theory. These models are both computational (e.g., simulation, emulation, expert systems, computer-assisted numerical analysis) and mathematical (e.g., formal logic, matrix algebra, network analysis, discrete and continuous equations). Much of the research in this area falls into four areas: organizational design, organizational learning, organizations and information technology, and organizational evolution and change. Historically, much of the work in this area has been focused on the issue how should organizations be designed. The work in this subarea is cumulative and tied to other subfields within organization theory more generally. The second most developed area is organizational learning. This research, however, is more tied to the work in psychology, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence than to general organization theory. Currently there is increased activity in the subareas of organizations and information technology and organizational evolution and change. Advances in these areas may be made possible by combining network analysis techniques with an information processing approach to organizations. Formal approaches are particularly valuable to all of these areas given the complex adaptive nature of the organizational agents and the complex dynamic nature of the environment faced by these agents and the organizations. © 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Persistent object systems are highly-valued technology because they offer an effective foundation for building very long-lived persistent application systems (PAS). The technology becomes more effective as it offers a more consistently integrated computational context. For it to be feasible to design and construct a PAS it must be possible to incrementally add program and data to the existing collection. For a PAS to endure it must offer flexibility: a capacity to evolve and change. This paper examines the capacity of persistent object systems to accommodate incremental construction and change. Established store based technologies can support incremental construction but methodologies are needed to deploy them effectively. Evolving data description is one motivation for inheritance but inheritance alone is not enough to support change management. The case for supporting incremental change is very persuasive. The challenge is to provide technologies that will facilitate it and methodologies that will organise it. This paper identifies change absorbers as a means of describing how changes should propagate. It is argued that if we systematically develop an adequate repertoire of change absorbers then they will facilitate much better quality change management. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1993.

AB  - This paper presents a partial theory of arguing with precedents in law and illustrates how that theory supports multiple interpretations of a precedent. The theory provides succinct computational definitions of (1) the most persuasive precedents to cite in the principal argument roles and (2) the most salient aspects of the precedents to emphasize when citing them in those roles. Ati extended example, drawn from the output of the HYPO program, illustrates the range of différent descriptions of the same precedent that are supported by the theory. Each description focuses on different salient aspects of the case depending on the argument context. © ACM.

AB  - This paper brings together ideas from work on commonsense causal reasoning and work on formalising attitudes, such as beliefs, desires, intentions and obligations, to provide the basis of a theory of changing attitudes. It takes the view that rational agents do not change their attitudes without reason, and aims to represent such changes in teleological theories. The infrastructure of these theories contain persistence rules which state that agents attitudes persist unless they have reason to change them. Theories giving the agents’ reasons for changing their attitudes build on these. This leads to a discussion of rationality in resource-bounded agents and the paper concludes by outlining an AI-planning theory of rational agency. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 1995.

AB  - Machine learning techniques can increase the power/expertise and improve the problem-solving efficiency of artificial intelligence applications for complex problems such as reactive scheduling in manufacturing operations management. Reactivity requires adaptively changing behaviour of a performance system that can best be supported by learning from experience. Reactive scheduling is considered in this paper with two options for reactive repair/proactive schedule adjustment to compensate for/prevent the effects of disturbances during the execution time of a current schedule. With a supervisory control perspective to shop floor operations, reactive scheduling of the two options above is embodied as one major intelligent supervisory function in a supervisory reactive scheduler SUPREACT and complemented by a cognitive learning approach to improve search space/control pattern-matching knowledge for guiding iterative schedule repair actions. In a brief overview, some learning approaches that comprise past experience for future re-use in reactive scheduling are referred to. The paper then presents a combined rule- and case-based reasoning/learning approach to opportunistic reactive scheduling based on a blackboard framework of the system's Expert Supervisor Unit, which also supports human integration into supervisory control of executed processes. Inherent learning ability of the case-based component allows to capture new schedule repair/search control knowledge, including also human preferences, and thus improve the system's reactive/pro-active schedule repair efficiency in response to unexpected events/performance deterioration trends during the execution of predictive schedules in manufacturing shop floors. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Rationality is a useful metaphor for understanding autonomous, intelligent agents. A persuasive view of intelligent agents uses cognitive primitives such as intentions and beliefs to describe, explain, and specify their behavior. These primitives are often associated with a notion of commitment that is internal to the given agent. However, at first sight, there is a tension between commitments and rationality. We show how the two concepts can be reconciled for the important and interesting case of limited, intelligent agents. We show how our approach extends to handle more subtle issues such as precommitments, which have previously been assumed to be conceptually too complex. We close with a proposal to develop conative policies as a means to represent commitments in a generic, declarative manner. © 1997, Springer-Verlag. All rights reserved.

AB  - A framework is summarized which supports the planning of natural language argument structure. One key aspect of natural argument is the order in which components are presented. This is in part responsible for both the coherency and persuasive effect of an argument. One means of effecting such ordering is proposed, and an overview is provided of the various classes of ordering heuristics. These heuristics are based upon insights offered by rhetoric texts, psychological research, and a corpus study. Finally, it is demonstrated that such an approach can also contribute to the generation of surface textual features including formatting, punctuation and clue words.

AB  - The information model of systemic functions of the human brain reproduces important features of human intelligence: goal planning, prediction of needed results, behavior correction by feedback from the parameters of the results obtained and their comparison with the acceptor of action results. Human behavior imitation in the model is statistically proved by testing the model on a computer. An Adaptron apparatus based on the model quantitatively estimates the parameters of an important mechanism of the brain, namely human intuitive learning. With the Adaptron, the ade-dependent properties and some human intellectual dysfunctions are estimated, which reflect the mechanisms of prediction of future results, the building of memory traces in intuitive learning when the findings coincide with the planned results and the restructure of memory and respective behavior changes when the findings do not coincide with the planned ones.

AB  - The author investigates the migration of a process from the symbol level to the knowledge level based on one such study done on an atomic reactor. In engineering there are self-emerging processes grouped under the common term boostrap. The nature of such bootstraps is examined in providing explanations for exotic new states in the reactor. Knowledge engineers formulate the performance of the reactor on a problem space, where they are forced to postulate the existence of a special function, called the delta function, to explain the occurrences of bootstraps. At the symbol level, the existence of bootstrap operation triggered by a delta function is seen to have its origin from the basic non-monotonic behavior of the system. At the knowledge level, it is argued that a bootstrap or its persuasive explanation comes from the knowledge engineer who is the architect of the system, both at the symbol and knowledge level. It is argued that knowledge engineers should be able to design metarules to control and explain bootstraps.

AB  - Researchers in economics- and business-related industries have shown interest in negotiation paradigms involving interacting agents. Many researchers in artificial intelligence are looking at the possibility of modelling negotiation. It has been viewed as a traversal in a large search space of solutions with the objective of satisfying what appeared in the beginning antagonistic interests. In this paper we briefly review some of the relevant work in the area of negotiation. We discuss a model for the lending process of a banking industry and its implementation. We make some concluding remarks mostly based on this experience. © 1993.

AB  - This paper presents Persuasive Argumentation as a means of guiding the negotiation process to a settlement. Decision theoretic approaches construct prescriptive models of the negotiation process that make various assumptions about the behavior of the negotiation participants but do not model changes in behavior. On the other hand, models for decision support leave the actual decisions to human negotiators, again not modeling or automating the negotiating process. In contrast to both approaches, our work deals with automating the negotiation process. This paper focuses on modeling the process by which the beliefs and behavior of negotiators are changed via persuasive argumentation. We claim that persuasive argumentation lies at the heart of negotiation and embodies the dynamics of negotiation. We present a model of persuasive argumentation that integrates Artificial Intelligence and decision theoretic methods. The model has been implemented as part of the PERSUADER, a multi-agent computer program that operates in the domain of labor negotiations. © 1990 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - John Searle's Chinese room argument is perhaps the most influential and widely cited argument against artificial intelligence (AI). Understood as targeting AI proper - claims that computers can think or do think - Searle's argument, despite its rhetorical flash, is logically and scientifically a dud. Advertised as effective against AI proper, the argument, in its main outlines, is an ignoratio elenchi. It musters persuasive force fallaciously by indirection fostered by equivocal deployment of the phrase "strong AI" and reinforced by equivocation on the phrase "causal powers' (at least) equal to those of brains." On a more carefully crafted understanding - understood just to target metaphysical identification of thought with computation ("Functionalism" or "Computationalism") and not AI proper the argument is still unsound, though more interestingly so. It's unsound in ways difficult for high church - "someday my prince of an AI program will come" - believers in AI to acknowledge without undermining their high church beliefs. The ad hominem bite of Searle's argument against the high church persuasions of so many cognitive scientists, I suggest, largely explains the undeserved repute this really quite disreputable argument enjoys among them. © 1997 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - As sensitivity to social issues increases, corporations face a particularly difficult challenge when confronted with trade-offs between corporate self-interest and the public interest. The difficulty of resolving these social dilemmas in groups is amplified by value COE,flicts across group members and also by conflicts between an individual's personal values and those of the cori)oralion. This study investigates the impact of group support systems (GSS) on persuasive processes and decision outcomes associated with social dilemmas. The theoretical foundation for the study is the literature on group polarization, in particular the theories of persuasive arguments and social comparison (Isenberg 1986). © 1994, Association for Information Systems.

AB  - Choosing between multiple ontological perspectives is crucial for reasoning about the physical world. Choosing the wrong perspective can make a reasoning task impossible. This paper introduces a Lagrangian plug flow ontology (PF) for reasoning about thermodynamic fluid flow. We show that this ontology captures continuously changing behaviors of flowing fluids not represented in currently implemented ontologies. These behaviors are essential for understanding thermodynamic applications such as power cycles, refrigeration, liquefaction, throttling and flow through nozzles. We express the ontology within the framework of Qualitative Process (QP) theory. To derive our QP theory for plug flow, we use the method of causal clustering to find causal interpretations of thermodynamic equations. We also incorporate qualitative versions of standard thermodynamic relations, including the second law of thermodynamics and Clapeyron's equation.

AB  - A set of models developed by Chittaro for fault diagnosis is extended to represent more complex engineering systems. A novel methodology for qualitative reasoning about behaviour change has been developed for the purpose of failure modes and effects analysis to cope with complete and partial failure modes. The method is demonstrated on an electrically driven gear pump. A further extension is the ability to cope with control systems by distinguishing the function of two closed loop control schemes. Different types of failure of the control scheme can be identified by analysing three different responses of the faulty plant. This method is demonstrated on a manufactured aerospace component called a fuel-metering unit controlled by a negative feedback control scheme. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - Text generation is a field of artificial intelligence aiming at producing computer models of natural language production. This paper discusses the use of the theory of 'Argumentation in Language' in the field of Text Generation. Most text generators follow the same sequence of steps to produce a coherent paragraph: content determination - selecting of information to include in the text from an underlying computer database; content organization - structuring of the propositions to be included in the text according to an appropriate rhetorical plan; finally lexical choice and syntactic realization - phrasing of the information using appropriate lexical items and syntactically correct constructions. The paper provides examples of the use of argumentative features to influence the generator's decisions throughout the generation process. The introduction of argumentative features allows the designer of a text generator to account for linguistic decisions that were not addressed in previous work, such as the selection of judgment determiners (many, few), scalar adjectives (interesting, difficult), connotative verbs (require, necessitate, enjoy, struggle) and connectives (but, therefore). Argumentative features are also used to organize the paragraph in a coherent manner. They are finally used to select appropriate information from a database to satisfy a given persuasive goal. The paper shows how the same descriptive device - the topoi introduced by Anscombre and Ducrot - can serve as the unifying representation level during the whole generation process and build a bridge between the conceptual and linguistic components of the generator. © 1995.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a group decision support system based on persuasion among agents. In the system. each user manages an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) system and an agent. Each user subjectively constructs a decision hierarchy and determines the various weights of alternatives by using AHP. Based on the hierarchy and weights, agents negotiate with each other on behalf of their users. In general, existing systems use a voting method for negotiating among agents. However, the result of voting are often inconsistent, largely due to the inconsistency of voting rules. Therefore, we propose a persuasion mechanism, rather than voting methods, for negotiation among agents. Adopting some of the features of AHP, we implement a new persuasion mechanism. The agents have an explanation mechanism. They can explain to their users why they have been persuaded, when they are persuaded, who persuaded them, and how they are persuaded. Finally, we describe the results from our current experiments. The results demonstrate that the persuasion mechanism is an effective method for a group decision support system based on multi-agent negotiation. © 1998 Scripta Technica.

AB  - In this paper, we describe how user-adapted explanations about drug prescriptions can be generated from already existing data sources. We start by illustrating the two-step approach employed in the first version of the natural language generator and the limitations of generated texts, that we discovered through analytical and empirical evaluations. We claim that, although style refinement would be needed in these texts, particular care should be devoted to implementing some of the persuasion techniques that doctors employ in their explanations. This would require either thoroughly revising the text planning techniques employed or converting to a multistep generation architecture. We justify why we selected this second alternative and propose some heuristics to repair problems found in the first version of the generator. Some final considerations about the advantages of this approach and the possibility of generalizing it to other domains conclude the paper.; In this paper, we describe how user-adapted explanations about drug prescriptions can be generated from already existing data sources.

AB  - Our argumentation system, NAG, uses Bayesian networks in a user model and in a normative model to assemble and assess arguments which balance persuasiveness with normative correctness. Attentional focus is simulated in both models to select relevant subnetworks for Bayesian propagation. The subnetworks are expanded in an iterative abductive process until argumentative goals are achieved in both models, when the argument is presented to the user.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an approach to the design of multi-agent systems based on an original model of the mental activity of single agents. In particular, we introduce the concept of active mental entity, as a new way of representing mental attitudes such as intentions and persuasions. The internal architecture of each agent is thus understood as a distributed system whose reasoning activity is determined by the interactions among active mental entities. Then, this architecture is extended in order to enable the agents to operate in a multi-agent context. A detailed description of the structure and operation of an agent and of a multi-agent system is thus provided. The implementation of the proposed paradigm is then illustrated and some performance examples are presented.

AB  - Cooperative Problem Solving (CPS) is an important paradigm that will extend the power of current information systems to provide broader, cheaper services and to solve larger, and increasingly, more complex problems. In this paper, we address a critical issue of this new mode of computing: the existence of conflict among distributed agents. In particular, we focus our study on Cooperative Knowledge-Based Systems (CKBS). To obtain a better understanding and more balanced judgement of multiagent conflict, we provide a general scheme to study the logical structure of multiagent conflict and rational strategies of coping with it under different situations. Our research finding is that there is no grand unified theory of coping with conflict in performing complex real-world computer supported tasks. Instead, a library of alternative methods should be considered. We discuss four methods: inquiry, arbitration, persuasion, and accommodation. These methods can be combined in an order appropriate to the application domain such that if one method fails, the system will try the next. We point out merits and shortcomings of these methods and illustrate them using several high-level protocols and application examples from a prototype system, Building Design Network (BDN). © 1997 IEEE.

AB  - After the early experiments in artificial intelligence a methodology is emerging around advanced systems for the management of medical knowledge. The stress is moving away from the implementation of prototypes to the evaluation. It is possible to adapt and to apply this to field evaluation techniques already developed in similar contexts of knowledge management (books, drugs, epidemiology, consultants, etc.). The time is ready for a further step: to envisage a methodology for the design of real systems that cope with the 'knowledge environment' of the user. Every stage of the evaluation process is re-examined here, and considered as a framework to define goals and criteria about a step of design: (1) the impact of the system on the progress of health care provision (priorities, cost-benefit analysis, share of tasks among different media); (2) effectiveness in the end-user's environment and long-term effects on his behaviour (changes in people's role and responsibilities, improvements in the quality of data, acceptance of the system); (3) the intrinsic efficiency of the system apart from the operational context (correctness of the knowledge base, appropriateness of the reasoning). The need to differentiate the test sample into three classes (obvious, typical, atypical) is emphasized, discussing the influence on both evaluation and design. In particular the difficulty of having 'gold standards' on atypical cases, due to the disagreement among the experts, leads to the definition of two alternative attitudes: the 'standardization mode' and the 'brain-storming mode'. © 1990 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.
